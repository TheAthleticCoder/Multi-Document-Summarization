"['Good Country Index Is Released, US Not In The Top 20 \n \n Trending News: How Good Of A Person Are You? Depends On Where You Live \n \n Why Is This Important? \n \n Because it may be time we all moved to Sweden. \n \n Long Story Short \n \n The latest edition of the Good Country Index has crowned Sweden as the world’s best country while the United States languishes down in 21st place. \n \n Long Story \n \n The United States of America may be the land of the free and the home of the brave, but it’s not even in the world’s top 20 countries, according to the latest version of the Good Country Index. \n \n The index, which is created by British policy advisor Simon Anholt, uses 35 categories to rate a nation’s contribution to the world, including Culture, Science and Technology and International Peace and Security and ranks them from number 1 to 163. The data comes from sources such as the UN and The World Bank. \n \n RELATED: Best Places To Live In The World 2016 \n \n The index’s mission statement reads: “We’re not making moral judgements about countries. What we mean by a Good Country is something much simpler: it’s a country that contributes to the greater good of humanity. A country that serves the interests of its own people, but without harming — and preferably by advancing — the interests of people in other countries too.” \n \n Topping the Good Country index is Sweden, moving up from sixth last time, which excels in Health and Wellbeing and Prosperity and Equality. Its nearest rival was fellow Scandinavian country Denmark followed by the Netherlands, Great Britain and then Germany. \n \n The USA may be a little disappointed with 21st place, below the likes of France (8th) and New Zealand (10th), plus local rivals Canada (7th) and slightly embarrassingly lower than Cyprus (15th) and Luxembourg (16th). \n \n The US is somewhat harshly ranked 53rd in terms of cultural contribution and less surprisingly 66th for International Peace and Security while Health and Wellbeing is a decent 12th place. \n \n The world’s four least good countries according to the index are all African nations: Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Mauritania, Central African Republic followed by Iraq in 159th out of 163. \n \n Last year Ireland were top of the Index followed by Finland and Switzerland, but the report was mocked by many in Ireland who felt the result flattered their nation and many experts insist the data should be taken with a pinch of salt, but let’s face it we all love a list. \n \n Surely whoever wins the US election should be hoping to climb the ladder a little. \n \n Own The Conversation \n \n Ask The Big Question: Is the USA really only the 21st best country in the world? Can we really create an accurate ratings system for countries? \n \n Disrupt Your Feed: The US can have few complaints on International Peace and Security, but 53rd for global contribution to culture? What TV shows are these guys watching? \n \n Drop This Fact: The World Happiness report for 2016 found that Denmark is the happiest nation followed by Switzerland and Iceland with Canada in sixth. The USA was 13th and the United Kingdom was 23rd.', 'Just fill in your contact details in the form below to join our mailing list and keep up to date with the Good Country as it develops.', ""The Good Country Index doesn’t measure what countries do at home. This isn't because we think these things are unimportant, of course, but because there are plenty of surveys that already measure them. What the Index does aim to do is to start a global discussion about how countries can balance their duty to their own citizens with their responsibility to the wider world, because this is essential for the future of humanity and the health of our planet. We hope that looking at these results will encourage you to take part in that discussion.""]",3,"– Skal, Sweden! Raise a glass to the Scandinavian nation, which beat out 162 others to win the overall top spot in the ""Good Country Index,"" a ranking of the world's countries, the Independent reports. The list is based on 35 various indicators from sources such as the World Bank and the UN, separated into the categories of culture, science and tech, prosperity and equality, world order, international peace and security, planet and climate, and health and well-being. The US just missed making the top 20, coming in at No. 21. And in last place—Libya. ""A good country is one that successfully contributes to the good of humanity,"" British policy adviser Simon Anholt, who established the Good Country Index, tells the Independent.

"['A CAR park in a Highland town has been confirmed by archaeologists as the meeting place of a medieval Norse parliament. \n \n Excavations at the Cromartie Memorial car park in Dingwall uncovered evidence of a mound that archaeologists believe was established in the 11th century as a gathering spot for a Viking parliament, known as a “Thing”. \n \n Picture: Contributed \n \n When it was constructed the “Thing” would have been on a man-made islet in the estuary of the River Pefferey, historians claimed. They believe the mound was built on the instructions of Thorfinn the Mighty, a powerful Viking earl who died in 1065. \n \n He is thought to have laid the foundations of what would later become the royal burgh of Dingwall in Ross-shire. \n \n It is only the second time a “Thing” site has been uncovered in the UK. Yesterday historians said the discovery would help them learn more about the Norse Vikings, who battled for control of land across the north of Scotland. \n \n David MacDonald, of Dingwall History Society, which was part of the dig partnership, said that a road, a ditch and an aqueduct, known as the Water of Dyke, that drew water from hillside springs, were also constructed when Thorfinn was in control of Ross-shire. \n \n He said Thorfinn’s rise to power was aided by his victory in a battle at Torfnes on the south side of the Cromarty Firth, possibly against MacBeth’s troops. At the height of his power, Thorfinn became Lord of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney. \n \n The origins of the town of Dingwall as a Viking Thing-site had long puzzled historians and archaeologists alike, with many believing it was elsewhere on the Black Isle in Ross-shire. \n \n But now the results of the archaeological dig, the culmination of Highland Council’s participation as a partner in the EU Northern Periphery International Thing Project, has come up with real answers. \n \n Mr MacDonald said: “You can call this the official confirmation of the car park being the location of a ‘Thing’. \n \n “It has been very exciting over the years, but all the historical research points in this direction.” \n \n In recent times historical investigation identified the Cromartie car park – which contains the burial place and memorial monument of George, first earl of Cromartie, who died in 1714 – as the site of the long lost Moothill of Dingwall, the town’s medieval meeting place. This has now been confirmed as deriving from the Viking Thing-mound. \n \n A trial trench excavation in the car park in 2012 showed significant radio-carbon datings. \n \n According to archaeologist Dr Oliver O’Grady, a leading authority on the assembly mounds of Scotland, who was part of the dig : “The excavations have confirmed the presence of important archaeological remains and indicated that the mound was man-made and probably created during the 11th century. \n \n “The radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider North-east Scotland. \n \n “The lack of substantial occupation remains or burial activity is also further circumstantial evidence that the mound was created for an assembly site or Thing. \n \n “The substantial manpower and effort required to create a monument on the scale of the Dingwall mound would also seem in keeping with the establishment of a major regional judicial and administrative centre.” \n \n Dingwall, which lies at the head of the Cromarty Firth, is a location on a European tourist trail of Thing sites. Funded by the EU, the Thing Sites GeoTour involves Scotland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroes and Isle of Man.', 'A parking lot in Scotland was once the site of a Viking parliament, new research suggests \n \n A Viking parliamentary site that dates to the 11th century has been found beneath a parking lot in Scotland. \n \n The site, located in the town of Dingwall, Scotland, was dubbed a ""Thing"" site, referring to its name in antiquity. Like other Thing sites, this one was likely a place where ancient Norsemen gathered to settle legal disputes, uphold laws and make key political decisions. \n \n ""It\'s a fantastic find, really,"" said Oliver J. T. O\'Grady, the director of the site\'s excavations and an archaeologist who runs an archaeological consulting firm called OJT Heritage. ""No one\'s had dating [information] from a Thing site in Scotland."" \n \n The Thing \n \n Historians had long wondered whether Dingwall was a site of a Viking parliamentary gathering known as the Thing because the word Dingwall probably originated from the word thingvellir, which means ""the field of the assembly."" [Fierce Fighters: 7 Secrets of Viking Culture] \n \n Such Thing sites are scattered from Iceland to Norway to the Shetland Islands, and Norsemen traveled from far and wide to get to the seasonal gatherings, often to settle disputes that would otherwise end in bloodshed. But Things were held mostly at open-air fields, and people only stayed temporarily, leaving relatively few archaeological traces of their presence. \n \n ""Many archaeologists have said, \'How do you find the archaeology of a bunch of people gathering together?\'"" O\'Grady told LiveScience. \n \n O\'Grady and his colleagues at The Thing Project, which works on similar sites around Europe, were not deterred, because traces of temporary dwelling booths had turned up at other Thing sites. \n \n Digging up democracy \n \n Using historical records, the team found a mound near the inlet of an estuary in Dingwall that was called the moothill, or assembly mound, in the 13th century. Later on, Scottish earls were buried there. In 1947, local authorities bulldozed the top of the mound and turned the area into a parking lot. (Parking lots seem to be rich sources of history in the U.K. — Richard III\'s skeleton was found underneath a parking lot, as was a medieval knight in Scotland.) \n \n The team dug a small trench across the mound and used radioactive carbon isotopes, or atoms of carbon with different molecular weights, to date the charcoal found in the soil. (These radioactive isotopes decay at different rates and can be used to date soils and objects.) \n \n The team found that some of the upper layers of the soil date to the medieval period, likely when it was called the moothill, and contain shards of pottery and fragments of an iron vessel. \n \n A site in Dingwall, Scotland, revealed traces of a 13th century iron vessel underneath a parking lot. Credit: Dr. Oliver J. T. O\'Grady \n \n But below that, the team found the first layers that were used to construct the mound, with soil dating to around the 11th century. \n \n By this period of history, the Vikings were no longer feared marauders sailing the seas and raiding Europe. Instead, the people who gathered at Dingwall were more likely subjects of Norse kings who ruled from the Orkney and Shetland Islands. \n \n No one knows yet who built the site, though the sheer size of the mound suggests it was a fairly significant undertaking that required a lot of political power and resources. \n \n No historical documents mention a Thing gathering site near the region, but Earl Thorfinn the Mighty came down from the Orkney Islands at the time and fought a battle in the general region. \n \n ""He would certainly have had a political reason to make a statement,"" O\'Grady said. \n \n Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

Original article on LiveScience.']",2,"– Archaeologists have uncovered another parking lot find, only this time it's in Scotland, and what they discovered is best described as a ""Thing."" Yep, that's the technical term for a Viking parliamentary gathering site, one of which has been unearthed in the town of Dingwall. That name had long clued archaeologists into the potential for such a find: Dingwall is likely derived from the word thingvellir, or ""the field of the assembly,"" LiveScience reports. But finding a ""Thing"" site is no small task, in part because the gatherings usually occurred in open fields, and the temporary nature of them meant only modest traces of human life were left behind. Indeed, this is only the second ""Thing"" found in the UK, the Scotsman reports. It was uncovered after the team used historical records to identify a mound that had once been called the ""assembly mound""; a parking lot now covers it. Excavations ""indicated that the mound was man-made,"" likely in the 11th century, says site director Oliver JT O'Grady, and ""radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider."" He and his team aren't exactly sure who built the site, but based on its size, that creator would have needed both ""political power and resources,"" explains LiveScience. One guess: Thorfinn the Mighty, who fought a battle in the area around that time. (In less positive Viking news, ancient jewels were stolen this week.)"

"[""The 10 women on our Highest-Paid TV Actresses list earned a total of $94 million between May 2010 and May 2011. That may seem like a lot, but consider their movie peers: Just the top three women in movies earned almost as much combined ($88 million). \n \n So yes, women make a lot less in TV than they do if they are big movie stars, but there are advantages. Working mothers with TV roles usually get to stay in L.A. (or New York) instead of having to jet around the world to film locations. There's a steady paycheck and no worrying about Angelina Jolie beating you out for the part in the next big film. \n \n And usually the roles are better. None of the women on our list play the doting girlfriend or the damsel in distress.

And while the show hasn't been a massive rating success for Comcast's NBC network, it has developed the kind of loyal following that laps up DVDs and watches the shows again and again. 30 Rock is now in syndication on Fox and Comedy Central. Fey's unique take on the work-place comedy is a big part of the reason the show draws such loyal fans. Who else but Fey could coin a term like lizzing? \n \n The women on Desperate Housewives aren't pushovers either. Longoria leads the pack with $13 million thanks to lucrative endorsement deals with L'Oreal and LG, but all three of her co-stars are also on our list. Marcia Cross ranks third with $10 million and Felicity Huffman and Terry Hatchertie for fifth with $9 million each. \n \n The adventures of the four suburban housewives have been a boon for Disney's ABC. When the show hit the air in 2004 (along with Lost), it transformed ABC from a has-been to the hottest network almost overnight. The show has had a massive run but its current season (the eighth) will be the show's last. The season's recent premiere was the show's lowest rated. \n \n But don't cry for the ladies.

"['Hunger is assumed to motivate eating, which satisfies the caloric needs underlying the motivation. However, hunger’s influence extends beyond food consumption to the acquisition of nonfood items that cannot satisfy the underlying need (e.g., binder clips), suggesting that domain-specific motives can influence behavior in unrelated domains that are irrelevant to the motive. This is likely to occur when the domain-specific response includes concepts and behaviors that can also guide decisions in other domains. \n \n Abstract \n \n Hunger motivates people to consume food, for which finding and acquiring food is a prerequisite. We test whether the acquisition component spills over to nonfood objects: Are hungry people more likely to acquire objects that cannot satisfy their hunger? Five laboratory and field studies show that hunger increases the accessibility of acquisition-related concepts and the intention to acquire not only food but also nonfood objects. Moreover, people act on this intention and acquire more nonfood objects (e.g., binder clips) when they are hungry, both when these items are freely available and when they must be paid for. However, hunger does not influence how much they like nonfood objects. We conclude that a basic biologically based motivation can affect substantively unrelated behaviors that cannot satisfy the motivation. This presumably occurs because hunger renders acquisition-related concepts and behaviors more accessible, which influences decisions in situations to which they can be applied.', 'Shopping when hungry could be a bad idea (Image: UpperCut Images/Getty) \n \n Shopping on an empty stomach? Go and eat something quick! People buy far more stuff and spend more money when they\'re hungry than when they\'re full, and that extends to non-edible goods, too, according to a study of the association between our bellies and our belongings. \n \n One day in 2007, Alison Jing Xu, who studies decision-making at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, sat down at a mall restaurant and suddenly regretted everything she had just bought. ""I wondered why half an hour ago it had seemed like a good idea to buy 10 pairs of tights, not just the two I needed,"" she says. \n \n ""As a researcher interested in human behaviour, I wanted to understand this. We already know that when we are hungry in a supermarket, we buy more food – I wondered whether hunger might have also increased my desire to purchase non-food items."" \n \n To find out, she and her colleagues conducted five different experiments. \n \n In one experiment, 77 volunteers going in or out of a cafe were asked to rate how hungry they were, and then asked to rate a set of 10 items for how likeable they were and a different set for their desire to have them. \n \n The sets always included a variety of five food items such as a sandwich or a cookie, and five non-food items such as a wireless mouse or a spa visit. On average, hunger had increased how much the participants liked food items and had no effect on non-food items, but it significantly increased their desire to acquire both food and non-food items. \n \n Gimme those clips! \n \n In another experiment, 63 people came to the lab with an empty stomach. Half were then fed some cake. All the volunteers were asked to examine a binder clip and decide how many they would like to try out. They were also asked how much they liked the clips and how hungry they were from one to 10. \n \n Once again, hunger had no effect on how much people liked the clips. However, hungry participants – who had an average score of 7.72 on the hunger scale – asked to take away 70 per cent more free clips than those who had just eaten and had an average rating of 2.91 on the hunger scale. \n \n To find out if the same association held true for real purchases, the team hung around outside a large department store that mainly carried non-food goods. \n \n They asked 81 customers leaving the store whether they could have a peek at their receipt. They also asked them to rate their hunger and their mood, and to say how long they had been in the store. Customers who were hungry – whose hunger score was above the median score for the whole group - spent 64 per cent more money than those who were less hungry – even when the team allowed for mood and time spent shopping. \n \n Spill-over effect \n \n So what\'s going on? When we are hungry, our stomach releases a hormone called ghrelin. This acts on an area of the brain called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in reward and motivation, making people want to seek out and consume calories. \n \n Jing Xu suggests that ghrelin\'s effect also spills over into non-food domains – prompting you to acquire more of everything when you are hungry. ""We\'d like to make consumers aware of the possibility that if they go shopping on an empty stomach, they might spend more money that they intend to – so better feed themselves before they go out,"" she says. \n \n She adds: ""We\'re now going to look at how hunger might influence other behaviours, like how people communicate with others."" \n \n Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1417712112 \n \n If you would like to reuse any content from New Scientist, either in print or online, please contact the syndication department first for permission.

Now a new study suggests walking into a mall while hungry is just as bad—at least for your wallet. The study's title sums up the finding: ""Hunger promotes acquisition of nonfood objects."" Reporting in the journal PNAS, researchers at the University of Minnesota say they conducted five experiments whose results consistently showed an increase in the desire to acquire things when people reported being hungry. In one experiment where the items (in this case, binder clips) were free, the hungry cohort left with 70% more than satiated participants. And even when people had to pay (this time for department store items), the hungry ones spent 64% more. ""It's probably better to feed yourself before any type of shopping, whether you're going on an actual shopping trip or shopping online,"" researcher Alison Jing Xu tells Smithsonian. ""And if you're really hungry, you'd better think twice before purchasing any items at all or you might regret those purchases later."" (The study notes that ""hunger does not influence how much they like nonfood objects."") New Scientist reports Xu was inspired by a shopping trip of her own, during which she bought 10 pairs of tights on an empty stomach, ""not just the two I needed."" She says ghrelin, a hormone released by the stomach that makes people seek out food, may also affect other behaviors. (Doctors are puzzled by a boy who's never hungry.)"
"['KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A Swiss climber who found the long-lost bodies of a renowned mountaineer and his cameraman on one of the world\'s tallest mountains said it took days for him and his climbing partner to realize whom they had found. \n \n Mountaineer Ueli Steck said he and David Goettler were attempting to climb China\'s Mount Shishapangma and saw the bodies on a glacier at a height of 5,900 meters (19,350 feet). \n \n It was only when they got back to base camp after their failed attempt that they thought the bodies may have been of Alex Lowe and David Bridges, who were swept away by an avalanche in 1999 and had been attempting to climb the world\'s 14 highest mountains. \n \n Lowe was regarded as the world\'s greatest mountain climber when he was swept to his death at age 40. Bridges, then 29, was an accomplished high-altitude climber and cinematographer. \n \n ""We didn\'t realize this could be Alex and David. But when we were back in base camp we were talking about this and were like — oh these two bodies could be,"" Steck said Monday in Kathmandu after returning from the mountain. \n \n Steck said Goettler then called Cornad Anker, who was climbing with Lowe and Bridges at the time of avalanche, and gave him a description of the clothes, shoes and backpack on the bodies. \n \n ""Conrad made the conclusion that it was the two friends of his,"" Steck said. \n \n Steck said he did not touch or move the bodies, which were found on the mountain\'s difficult ""British route,"" which is not very popular. Steck and Goettler were the only climbers this season on the southern face of the 8,027-meter (26,330-foot) mountain. \n \n Steck climbed the peak in 2011 but on a route slightly to the right and did not see the bodies then. \n \n Lowe was known as ""Lungs With Legs"" for his incredible strength and stamina. He climbed Mount Everest twice, and is credited with rescuing several climbers in Alaska in 1995, a year when six climbers died on Mount McKinley.', ""April 10th, 2016 \n \n April is here and this is the time that many trekking and climbing expeditions come to Nepal and venture into the high valleys of the Himalaya. We are one year out from the devastating earthquakes that shook Nepal last April and recovery is ongoing. \n \n \n \n On behalf of our ALCF Board, I would like to thank all of you who donated for earthquake relief in the last year. We responded to need immediately and were able to disburse over 100 thousand dollars in emergency and long term aid to six regions within three months of the quakes. Your donations purchased food, clothing, temporary and permanent shelter, first aid and porter wages to deliver aid. In addition, we helped to reestablish power and water to the community of Phortse where our work with the Khumbu Climbing Center is focused and ongoing. \n \n \n \n Phortse village is home to a approximately 350 people, mostly Sherpa and of those living here, there are 80 living Everest summiters. This tiny community has more Everest summiters than anywhere on Earth with several generations of climbers in some families. Thus it is a fitting place for the Khumbu Climbing Center which has been educating indigenous climbers now for fourteen years. \n \n \n \n With a crippled economy after the quakes and fuel embargoes to make things worse, the vocation of a climbing Sherpa is still a sought after position and one that bolsters the economy of many mountain communities in Nepal. \n \n The technical education provided by the Khumbu Climbing Center is vital to the safety of high altitude workers. In fourteen years we have educated over 1000 students with technical climbing, mountain rescue and safety. \n \n \n \n We are now in full construction mode to finish an earthquake safe, passive solar building to house the KCC and serve as a community center and library for the village of Phortse. With no overhead, our funds go directly into the economy of Nepal. Please help us to provide a permanent and enduring home for the high altitude Indigenous climbers. \n \n \n \n Donate today! With gratitude, Jenni \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n June 4th, 2015 \n \n \n \n Dear friends of Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation, On behalf of our ALCF board, I want to take a moment to thank you for your generous donation for earthquake relief in Nepal. The situation there is dire since the second quake that devastated many remote villages, killing people and precious livestock and damaging roads and trails that are vital for food supply. There will be many ongoing negative impacts with the arrival of the monsoons this month. Since the first earthquake rocked Nepal on April 25th , ALCF was able to mobilize immediately with the infrastructure of our Khumbu Climbing School and Magic Yeti teams. We have sent forty thousand dollars in emergency aid to remote districts of Nepal that were hard hit by the quakes. The money was used to purchase food, shelter, medical supplies and to pay for porters to carry donated supplies to remote roadless areas. We have also delivered nine large duffels of tents, rain gear and warm clothes essential to survival during the monsoon. Our ALCF team has helped to organize donation transport and allocation for many more donated goods. With donations that they helped raise, Mike Auldridge and Parker Webb volunteered to travel to Nepal for ALCF on the 15th of May and were able to trek into the Khumbu and provide assistance to many people there including helping the village of Phortse to restore their water and electricity. Mike is now helping to rebuild a school and Parker is helping to rebuild homes in lower regions that were heavily damaged. This week we will send another twenty thousand dollars and eight more duffels of clothes and tents with board member Steve Mock and his wife Jan who have volunteered their time and resources to travel to Nepal. In the coming weeks, Pete Athans and Liesl Clark directors of the Magic Yeti Library will also travel to Nepal for documentary work and will assist in delivering much needed aid. Thanks once again for helping to bring hope and care to those in need in Nepal. With Gratitude, Jenni Lowe-Anker \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n April 13, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dear Friends of Nepal, \n \n The disheartening news of yesterday's quake left us reeling with the magnitude of this disaster. We heard from some of our ALCF team in Nepal as they continue to respond to the crisis in the capacity that we can, helping to fund emergency aid to remote regions. It is of utmost importance that you spread the word to colleagues and friends to dig deep with compassion and donate to the ORG or your choice to support Nepal. The quake yesterday added magnitudes of damage to high mountain villages so the relief effort and rebuilding process will take years. Our immediate response has been to allocate emergency funds to four badly affected regions, including Manang, Langtang, Ghorka and Solukhumbu and we are organizing a large building crew including skilled carpenters and masons to visit the Solukhumbu region in the autumn and help rebuild. Our volunteers will donate their time, travel expenses and efforts and funds will go to aid, supplies and salaries for indigenous people. In the months to come, plan a trip to Nepal and spread the wealth of our own lives to those who are less fortunate. It is still a beautiful country with magnificent mountains, valleys with extraordinary people and rich culture. Your heart will fill if you can travel and see first hand that your dollars are reviving the economy. Thanks to all who have already given! \n \n With Kind Regards, Jenni \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n April 11, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n Dear Friends, \n \n \n \n \n \n It has been two weeks since the earthquake shook Nepal exactly one week and a year after last years Everest disaster, dwarfing the magnitude of tragedy that we felt then. The aftershocks continued to frighten people for nearly a week causing many to sleep outside for fear of returning to their homes. This was dangerous at altitude for the elderly and very young who may have been injured. Although the Khumbu fared pretty well aside from some damaged structures, Thame is mostly flattened with 90 percent of houses there destroyed but only 2 casualties. \n \n \n \n \n \n 18 died at basecamp which included 12 Nepali. \n \n \n \n \n \n I have had a bit of communication with Dr. Luanne Freer of Everest ER who worked three seasons as the KCC medical instructor. She returned to Nepal as soon as she heard the news and has worked the front lines of rescue teams, tending to injured. Her HRA team at basecamp tended to some seventy injuries immediately after the avalanche. The news from Langtang and Manaslu was grim as rescue workers and aid finally reached those areas. Tsering, our KCC building project manager, sent us a dispatch from Langtang where he was on a rescue team and Ang - a seasoned KCC instructor, spearheaded rescue efforts as well. I was pleased to realize that the KCC students who have gone through our ranks were using their mountain rescue and first aid skills as well as their leadership skills to help their own and other communities. \n \n \n \n \n \n We have also been in communication with Dave Morton of Juniper Fund who was in Thame during the quake. ALCF will continue our relationship with Juniper Fund to support those who lost family members on Everest. \n \n \n \n \n \n Board member and KCC Director Pete Athans and Liesl Clark, Magic Yeti Libraries Director, jumped in with communicating and helping to assess loss and organize aid. Our Magic Yeti libraries suffered some damage and the Thame one was destroyed. Pete and Liesl are heading over to do a documentary within the next month or so and will be able to help organize the repairs and rebuilds. \n \n \n \n \n \n Conrad and I spoke to Willy Benegas, Everest guide and longtime supporter of KCC, who was there during the quake. He left Nepal briefly to organize some aid for those remote areas which were being overlooked. He is returning this week to organize and pay surviving villagers in Manaslu to carry loads of food and aid supplies that were left at the end of the road or far down valley from where they are needed. This is a good way to infuse money into the economy. ALCF has committed to support this project and will also support aid to Langtang. \n \n \n \n \n \n Mike Auldridge, a professional builder who has worked on the earthquake safe KCC building, is headed over to Nepal for us on May 15th. Parker Webb, who interned at KCC two years ago and lived for a year in Nepal will join him. They will take stock of the KCC building project in Phortse and assess other damage to structures there. They will also transport emergency supplies. \n \n \n \n \n \n Board member and KCC Director Steve Mock and his wife Jan are headed over to Phortse on June 5th and will also carry emergency supplies for those areas most in need. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thanks for your continued support. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n May 1st, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n The April 25th, 2015 mega earthquake in Nepal has affected every one of the villages where we have children’s libraries. Our hearts are with our friends and colleagues all over Nepal. One of our libraries has been flattened, while the others have suffered much damage. The buildings will need to be rebuilt and repaired. In the immediate term, we’ve put together a team of Nepali and foreign volunteers from all over the world to address the needs of the people in the most hardest hit communities in Nepal. This team is working with Kathmandu Living Labs to get the most reliable local information about the remote communities that need basic shelter for their people. We are moving tarps, tents and blankets from India, Hong Kong and the USA to Nepal through the help of aid organizations and volunteers around the world willing to bring these supplies into the country as part of the checked baggage. We’ve created a person-to-person giving network to get these urgently-needed supplies to Nepal and out to the remote villages that are currently blank spots on the aid map. \n \n \n \n \n \n We’re also raising money for our longer-term mission of helping to rebuild the community centers and schools where our Magic Yeti Children’s libraries are housed. As soon as our immediate mission of getting tarps and tents out to the tens of thousands of homeless people left to sleep out in the open in the oncoming monsoon, we will turn our attention back to the villages where we are committed to help bring increased literacy to families and loved-ones. Any help you can provide will be appreciated and we thank you for all of your support during these heartbreaking times. \n \n Liesl Clark \n \n Director, Magic Yeti Children’s Libraries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Visit the Magic Yeti Children’s Libraries section to learn more. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n April 26, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n It is with a heavy heart that I write on behalf of The Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation today. We are deeply saddened to hear the news of a devastating earthquake in Nepal that has destroyed structures and taken many lives throughout the country. The quake caused a catastrophic avalanche from Pumori to sweep into Everest base camp resulting in many injured and dead. We send our prayers and condolences to Nepal and especially to those who have lost family members and homes. \n \n \n \n \n \n The news from Mount Everest is grim as the earthquake triggered an enormous avalanche that swept down into camp. The aftershocks continue to send smaller avalanches into and near base camp and the icefall. Right now, it appears that at least 18 have died in or near base camp. That toll may very well rise as many are still unaccounted for. Also, there were many climbers and guides at camps 1 and 2 above the ice fall when the avalanche occurred. Earthquake-induced movement within the ice fall has damaged or destroyed much of this already tenuous route through the treacherous terrain, the site of last year's major disaster. Everest Base Camp is frightening as every aftershock or loud sound leads to fear of another avalanche. \n \n \n \n \n \n We also have some very sparse reports that Phortse, the home to Khumbu Climbing Center, as well as some other nearby villages were badly damaged.We have no direct reports, though, as the quake apparently destroyed many cellular towers, and presently phone communication throughout much of the Khumbu region is impossible. \n \n \n \n \n \n The Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation (ALCF) is accepting relief donations that will be disbursed to the indigenous climbing communities of Nepal to help mitigate loss of life, livelihood or homes.

REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar \n \n Alex Lowe and David Bridges were swept away in 1999 by an avalanche during their attempt to scale the world’s 14th highest peak, Shishapangma. \n \n Ueli Steck of Switzerland and David Goettler of Germany, who were attempting the same South Face route to the 26,291-foot (8,013 m) peak, stumbled upon the bodies of the pair, encased in ice, at an altitude of 19,356 feet (5,900 m). \n \n “The bodies were two meters (six feet) apart,” Steck told Reuters after returning to the Nepali capital of Kathmandu from neighboring Tibet. \n \n A charity run by Lowe’s widow, Jenni Lowe-Anker, announced the find on May 2. \n \n Steck and Goettler, who had heard about the disappearance of the legendary climbers on the same route 16 years ago, descended to their advanced base camp, set up at 18,700 feet (5,700 m). \n \n Goettler called Conrad Anker, who was part of the 1999 expedition and survived the avalanche, describing their findings. \n \n “We did not know them and we could not recognize them,” Steck said, outside his hotel in Kathmandu. \n \n Based on the description, Anker had little doubt of the identities of the two bodies, as their clothing, boots and backpacks matched the gear Lowe and Bridges had when they disappeared. \n \n “We did not touch them out of respect and left the bodies on the mountain in the same position as we had discovered (them),” said the 40-year-old mountaineer from Interlaken, Switzerland. \n \n Bodies of climbers who perish in the Himalayas remain buried under the snow and emerge as the ice melts or glaciers move. \n \n Lowe, who was 40 at the time of his death, was regarded as the best American mountaineer of his generation when he and Bridges were swept away during an expedition that aimed to ski down Shishapangma. \n \n Lowe’s accomplishments included two climbs to the top of Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak, several first ascents in Antarctica and dozens of less prominent but highly technical ascents. \n \n Steck and Goettler made two attempts to reach the summit of Shishapangma this month, but failed because of bad weather.']",3,"– The mountaineers who discovered the bodies of long-lost American climbers Alex Lowe and David Bridges in Tibet left them untouched out of respect—and it took them days to realize who they were. Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck tells Reuters that he was on the way up Mount Shishapangma with German climber David Goettler when they found the bodies encased in ice at 19,356 feet. The men, who perished in an October 1999 avalanche, were just 6 feet apart. ""We did not touch them out of respect and left the bodies on the mountain in the same position as we had discovered [them],"" says Steck, considered one of the world's best mountaineers—just as Lowe was at the time of his death, notes the Guardian. ""We didn't realize this could be Alex and David. But when we were back in base camp we were talking about this and were like—oh, these two bodies could be,"" Steck tells the AP. Goettler called Conrad Anker, who survived the 1999 avalanche. Based on the description of the men's clothing and gear, Anker said he was sure that the bodies were those of Lowe, considered the best American climber of his generation, and renowned cameraman Bridges. Steck and Goettler were the only climbers to attempt the difficult southern route of Shishapangma this year, but they were unable to reach the summit in two attempts because of bad weather. Anker married Lowe's widow, Jennifer, in 2001 and adopted his three sons. ""Conrad, the boys, and I will make our pilgrimage to Shishapangma,"" Jennifer Lowe-Anker said in a statement after the bodies were found. ""It is time to put Alex to rest.""

"['STORRS, Conn. (WTNH) — Eight people have been arrested in Connecticut State Police‘s investigation into the death of UConn student Jeffny Pally. \n \n On October 16, police were called to the UConn Fire Department after a student was hit by a fire truck responding to a call. Jeffny Pally, 19, was sitting on the ground with her back against the outside of the fire station door. When the door went up for officials to respond to the call, Pally fell back and was hit by a UConn Fire vehicle. \n \n State Police say on January 31, they applied for arrest warrants for six students that had hosted an off-campus fraternity party that Pally had attended that night. According to the affidavit, Pally had three times the legal limit in her system. \n \n On Friday, police arrested the following: \n \n Patrick Callahan, 21, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Matthew Moll, 21, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Austin Custodio, 21, Pine Bush, NY. Charged with sale/delivery to minors. \n \n Dominic Godi, 21, Bolton, CT. Charged with possession of alcohol by a minor. \n \n Dylan Morose, 22, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Jonathan Polansky, 22, Beverly, MA. Charged with eight counts permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n The fraternity that the men were members of, Kappa Sigma, has recently lost its recognition on campus for sanctions unrelated to Pally’s death. \n \n All of the men are due in court on March 8. \n \n UConn sent News 8 the following statement: \n \n Jeffny Pally was a talented, ambitious, promising young woman and her death was a terrible tragedy. The entire university community joins her family and friends in continuing to mourn her loss. The University appreciates the thoroughness of the Connecticut State Police investigation. Questions about that criminal investigation and the arrests announced today should be directed to the Connecticut State Police. Federal student privacy law prevents UConn from discussing whether individual students face discipline cases. Generally speaking, any UConn student found to have violated the provisions of The Student Code may face penalties that range from probation to expulsion. The University has the authority to apply the requirements of the Code to students even when their conduct takes place off campus. The fraternity referenced in the arrest warrant affidavit, Kappa Sigma, recently lost its UConn recognition and housing based on off-campus incidents in September and October. Those incidents, which are referenced in the attached sanctions letter, were unrelated to Jeffny’s death. Kappa Sigma’s national office also has revoked the local group’s charter. \n \n The call that the fire department was responding to when Pally was killed turned out to be a false alarm. UConn police says that two students were involved in setting off a fire alarm that night. According to police, 20-year-old Jacob San-Juan and 19-year-old Michael Vaz stole a fire extinguisher from the Gant Science Building and set it off on the fourth floor of Russell Hall, a dormitory within the Northwest Residence Halls. \n \n Vaz and San-Juan are each charged with two counts of fourth-degree criminal mischief and sixth-degree larceny. They are due in court on March 6.', 'State police have charged six University of Connecticut students with alcohol-related offenses in connection with the October death of student Jeffny Pally, who was killed when she was run over by a UConn Fire Department vehicle. \n \n State police said the students charged were involved in hosting an off-campus party at a house affiliated with Kappa Sigma fraternity that Pally, 19, of West Hartford attended prior to the fatal incident. People gathered at the party to build a float for UConn\'s homecoming parade, which was scheduled for later in the day. The six students charged were Kappa Sigma members. \n \n Kappa Sigma fraternity was suspended by UConn on Feb. 1 after an investigation found that the organization violated UConn\'s student code by providing alcohol to minors and engaging in disruptive and endangering behavior, according to university records. \n \n Pally\'s blood alcohol content was more than three times what is considered legally drunk in Connecticut, according to the arrest warrant. \n \n Those charged were: \n \n Patrick Callahan, 21, Matthew Moll, 21, and Dylan Morose, 22, all of 51 Baxter Road, Mansfield; each charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. They were the hosts of the party where Pally was seen consuming alcohol prior to her death, according to the arrest warrant. \n \n Austin Custodio, 21, of Boyce Road, Pine Bush, N.Y.; sale or delivery of alcohol to minors. Custodio is accused of buying the beer and vodka consumed at the party at 51 Baxter Road. \n \n Dominic Godi, 21, of Meadow Road, Bolton; charged with conspiracy to commit sale or delivery of alcohol to minor. Godi was social chairman of the Kappa Sigma fraternity and after Custodio purchased the alcohol Godi transported it to 51 Baxter Road, according to the warrant. \n \n Jonathan Polansky, 22, of Sherman Street, Beverly, Mass., charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegal possess alcohol. At the time of the party, Polansky was on the lease at 51 Baxter Road and attended the party, according to the warrant. \n \n All were released from custody without having to post bail and are to be arraigned March 8 at Superior Court in Rockville. \n \n In addition, in October UConn police charged two students with larceny and two counts of criminal mischief in connection with the alarm that firefighters responded to when Pally was killed. \n \n Jacob San-Juan, 20, and Michael Vaz, 19, are accused of stealing a fire extinguisher from the Gant Science Building and then discharging it on the fourth floor of Russell Hall. Their cases are pending. \n \n State police said Pally was struck and killed by the fire department vehicle as it responded to an alarm at 1:13 a.m. on Oct. 16. Pally was seated with her back against the exterior door of one of the fire station\'s bays. When the door opened so that the fire vehicle could respond, Pally fell back. She was then struck by the Chevy Tahoe driven by the shift commander, Dana E. Barrow Jr., 60. \n \n A state police review of surveillance cameras showed that Pally was leaning against the garage door for at least 20 minutes before she was struck. After she was struck, her body was not found until about 30 minutes later when firefighters returned from the call. By that point she had no pulse and was not breathing, according to court records. \n \n Barrow told state police that he felt a bump as he drove from the garage bay, but thought he\'d driven over some firefighting equipment. When he looked in the rear view mirror, he told investigators, he saw something on the ground but thought it was gear. \n \n According to court records, witnesses told state police that Pally had been drinking before the incident. Toxicology testing revealed that Pally\'s blood alcohol content was .25, more than three times what is considered legally drunk in Connecticut. \n \n Barrow will not be charged, Tolland State\'s Attorney Matthew Gedansky said Friday. \n \n ""The accident reconstruction investigation determined that the firefighter could not see Ms. Pally in the position she was in,"" Gedansky said. ""We measured the line of sight, we recreated the incident and there\'s no possible way he could have seen her."" \n \n Pally was a member of Delta Gamma sorority. Sorority members were working with Kappa Sigma members to build a homecoming float. Pally, state police determined, arrived at the party about 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 15 and remained at the party until about 12:30 a.m. \n \n While there, she consumed one to five beers, witnesses told state police, according to the warrant. She had also been drinking before arriving at the party, according to the warrant. \n \n Pally and several other girls got a ride via Uber from 51 Baxter Road. The Uber driver told state police that he thought most of the girls who got into his minivan were drunk. He told state police he dropped Pally and another girl near their dorm, which is near the UConn fire station. \n \n ""After being dropped off at her dorm, [Pally], for an unknown reason, walked behind the University of Connecticut Public Safety Complex, sat in front of bay #7, and fell asleep,"" the warrant states. When ""the fire department responded to a fire service call, and as the door to bay #7 opened, the victim fell backwards, still remaining asleep."" The fire vehicle then ran over Pally. \n \n ""Jeffny Pally was a talented, ambitious, promising young woman and her death was a terrible tragedy,"" UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said. ""The entire university community joins her family and friends in continuing to mourn her loss."" \n \n All six students charged on Friday are currently enrolled at UConn, Reitz said, but she noted that students who have violated provisions of the student code may face penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. \n \n She said the time frame for when a penalty might be decided and imposed depends on a variety of factors ranging from the availability of the students for interviews to what facts need to be obtained. \n \n Kappa Sigma lost its UConn recognition and housing based on different off-campus incidents in September and October, said Reitz. Kappa Sigma\'s national office also has revoked the local group\'s charter, she said. \n \n Pally\'s family could not be reached for comment Friday evening. \n \n Courant reporter Kathleen Megan contributed to this story.']",2,"– A freak accident left the University of Connecticut reeling in October; now, six arrests may have it reeling once more. Jeffny Pally was sitting up against a garage bay door at a fire station near her dorm on the Storrs campus around 1:15am when the door opened as fire crews responded to a call. The 19-year-old sophomore fell back and was struck by a Chevy Tahoe leaving the firehouse. Why she chose to sit in front of the bay remains unknown, but police say they've pieced together what allegedly happened in the hours beforehand. On the evening of Oct. 15, Pally attended a party at the Kappa Sigma fraternity that revolved around building a homecoming parade float; now six frat members have been charged with alcohol-related offenses related to Pally's death, reports the Hartford Courant. Pally arrived around 10:30pm and stayed about two hours, during which witnesses say she had one to five beers; she reportedly drank prior to the party, and her blood alcohol content was .25. Patrick Callahan, Matthew Moll, Austin Custodio, and Dominic Godi, all 21, and Dylan Morose and Jonathan Polansky, 22, face varied charges tied to allegedly purchasing and transporting the booze and permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. Their arraignment is set for March 8. The 60-year-old shift commander who drove the Tahoe told police he did feel a bump as he exited, but assumed what he saw in his rearview mirror was fire equipment. Pally's body was discovered upon the fire crew's return to the station for what WTNH reports was a false alarm sparked after two students allegedly set off a stolen fire extinguisher in a dorm. They face criminal mischief and larceny charges. (Last year, a court ruled that parents could be held responsible for underage drinking.)"
"['For Republicans on Capitol Hill, Donald Trump may finally have gone too far. \n \n Tuesday’s report that Trump asked former FBI Director James Comey to end the criminal investigation into ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was more than just another embarrassing revelation for a president used to a near-daily barrage of scandal and staff intrigue. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Republicans are privately beginning to worry that they may one day have to sit in judgment of Trump, or that more damaging information from Comey could force the president to step down. Within hours of Tuesday\'s report by The New York Times, there was a distinct shift among congressional Republicans, who until now have mostly resisted criticizing Trump, let alone demanding the president be held to account for all he says or does. \n \n House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) immediately said he’s prepared to subpoena the memos that Comey reportedly wrote contemporaneously to document his interactions with Trump. Chaffetz sent a letter to the FBI on Tuesday night asking for any notes, documents or records of Trump and Comey’s conversations to be turned over to his panel by May 24. \n \n His request was echoed by AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan: ""We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo."" \n \n Comey has also been invited by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to testify publicly at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to “tell his side of the story” about his dealings with Trump, Graham said Tuesday, even before this latest story broke. \n \n More Republicans have openly discussed the possibility of a select committee or the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the Trump-Russia connection. It\'s still a minority of GOP lawmakers, but Republican leaders are watching closely. \n \n The White House vehemently denied the New York Times report, and Trump has defended his firing of Comey and reported disclosure of classified information to Russian officials. \n \n Not since October’s “Access Hollywood” moment — when many Republicans believed Trump would have to drop out of the race over his hugely offensive comments about women — has the president faced such a serious political threat. Even conservatives from districts that Trump won overwhelmingly in November want to find out what occurred between the president and Comey, no matter how damaging it may be to Trump. This is a dramatic turn for the party that\'s been whiplashed by Trump’s drama since his first day as a candidate in June 2015 yet has still stuck with him. \n \n “It is important to get to the bottom of it,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus. Meadows was last seen celebrating passage of the House GOP health care bill in the Rose Garden with Trump and dozens of his Republican colleagues. “We\'ve got one standard, and we need to make sure that applies to everybody.” \n \n Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway met with the Freedom Caucus on Tuesday night and would not say afterward what they discussed. Meadows insisted the Comey matter did not come up, but he told reporters that he intends, through his role on the Oversight Committee, to help get to the bottom of what happened. And he expects cooperation from the White House. \n \n “If this is legitimately something that there was some kind of influence or pressure from Comey doing his work, I’m going to be very disappointed,"" added Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. \n \n In private, top Republicans fear that this latest Trump controversy — coming just a week after he fired Comey, and only one day after it was revealed that the president revealed highly classified intelligence information during a meeting with Russian officials — will overwhelm everything they are trying to do legislatively. Health care, tax reform, building up the Pentagon — all of it is potentially threatened by the latest furor. \n \n And if Republicans are paralyzed and can’t pass anything despite control of the White House and Congress, how can they justify their majorities when they go before voters next year? \n \n Sen. Lindsay Graham listens as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse holds up a copy of ""The Kremlin Playbook"" at a hearing of the Senate Judicary Committee\'s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Capitol Hill on May 8. | Getty \n \n “I don’t think we can just shrug our shoulders and walk away from this one,” said a top House Republican, who asked not to be named. “I don’t know where this goes.” \n \n What is most worrying for congressional Republicans is how easy this latest episode is to explain to the public — Trump reportedly tried to interfere with a criminal investigation by the FBI but was rebuffed, then fired Comey — and thus fodder for endless cable TV coverage. That could spur moderate Republicans in swing districts, already nervous about 2018, to openly break with Trump. \n \n “If these allegations are true, it’s deeply troubling and it certainly opens up a new chapter that all of us have to consider very carefully,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) outside the House chamber Tuesday night. ""We need to get to the truth as soon as possible. This weekly scandal, this weekly controversy is unhealthy for the country. It’s a major distraction for the country and it’s just bad for the psyche of every American.” \n \n “I hope Director Comey testifies before Congress as soon as possible,” said Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), who earlier broke with Trump and his own leadership over health care reform legislation. \n \n Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) tweeted late Tuesday night. \n \n Rep. Pat Meehan (R-Pa.), a former federal prosecutor, suggested Trump’s interactions with Comey threatened the public perception of the Justice Department as an autonomous entity. \n \n “This whole process is very difficult because we are seeing the central institution — the Justice Department, and the independence of the Justice Department — stretched. And people want to have confidence in the independence of [DOJ’s] activities,” Meehan said. “I’m hoping that throughout this long process, it can get back into a place where there could be confidence in the ability of the institutions to do their work.” \n \n Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.', '“He really needs a lawyer,” Ms. O’Sullivan said of Mr. Trump. “He is building a beautiful case against himself.” \n \n Did Trump have lawful authority to fire Comey? \n \n Yes. But courts have ruled that otherwise lawful acts can constitute obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions. In a 1998 case, for example, a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of a lawyer who had filed legal complaints and related motions against a government agent who was investigating an illegal gambling operation. The court ruled that the defendant’s “nominally litigation-related conduct” was unlawful because his real motive was “to safeguard his personal financial interests” in the corrupt enterprise. \n \n What would such a case entail, in theory? \n \n Obstruction of justice cases often come down to whether prosecutors can prove defendants’ mental state when they committed the act, legal specialists said. It is not enough to show that a defendant knew the act would have a side consequence of impeding an investigation; achieving that obstruction has to have been the specific intention. \n \n Samuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor who led the Justice Department’s Enron task force and now teaches criminal law at Duke University, was initially skeptical about whether the mere firing of Mr. Comey could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Trump had an improper mental state. But he said on Tuesday that subsequent revelations have made the evidence much more robust. \n \n “The evidence of improper purpose has gotten much stronger since the day of Comey’s firing,” Mr. Buell said. “Trump has made admissions about that. And we now have evidence that he may have indicated an improper purpose previously in his communications with Comey about the Russia investigation.” \n \n What impediments would there be to charging Mr. Trump? \n \n Ms. O’Sullivan said it was not realistic to expect the Trump administration’s Justice Department to charge the sitting president. And Mr. Buell argued that the developments had strengthened the case for Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who is overseeing the investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, to appoint a special counsel to handle it. \n \n “The issue right now is whether there needs to be a serious impartial investigation, and there can be no doubt about that at this point,” said Mr. Buell, who said the developments showed that Mr. Comey needed to be interviewed as a witness. “This kind of drip, drip, drip — we keep addressing this scenario as ‘here is the evidence, what is the result,’ but that’s only good until tomorrow when something else comes out. It is not at all clear that this is the end. If anything, it has become clearer that there is more to know.” \n \n What about impeachment? \n \n “Asking FBI to drop an investigation is obstruction of justice,” Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “Obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense.”', 'A theatrical showdown is now looming between the President with a hazy relationship with the truth and the FBI director he fired, whose finely tuned sense of his own integrity has often steered him into rocky political waters. \n \n The epic head-to-head was set up by stunning allegations that in February Trump pressured Comey to shut down the FBI\'s Russia probe that was, among other avenues of inquiry, investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \n \n Furthermore, in a sensational development, sources told The New York Times and then CNN on Tuesday night that Comey wrote down his account of Trump\'s request over the probe in a memo that is about to become one of Washington\'s most famed artifacts. \n \n The coming confrontation between Comey and Trump is more than just an opportunity to air grievances that appear to have quickly grown between the two men during their short working relationship and over the FBI director\'s humiliating dismissal -- news of which he learned on cable television just one week ago. \n \n It promises to have grave implications for the longevity of an administration that appears to slip deeper into utter disarray by the hour. There doesn\'t seem to be a way that both men could survive the contest with their reputations intact. \n \n JUST WATCHED Cummings: Trump has stepped over the line Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cummings: Trump has stepped over the line 00:47 \n \n Compelling evidence \n \n Comey is the kind of adversary that no White House would relish. \n \n If the claims in his memo are correct, they would appear to offer the most compelling evidence yet that Trump\'s attempt to shut down the probe could amount to an obstruction of justice that imperils his presidency. \n \n ""It looks like he was trying to impede the investigation,"" said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. ""He was using his power to do that, and when James Comey didn\'t go along with him, when he wasn\'t his boy, he fired him."" \n \n Gergen suggested the situation was so serious following Tuesday\'s revelations that America could be on the cusp of a new impeachment drama. \n \n The White House has dismissed Comey\'s version of events revealed by a memo that was described to CNN. \n \n ""While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" a White House official said in a statement. \n \n The prospect of a new arm\'s length confrontation with Comey might also be causing Trump to second guess himself after suddenly firing the former director last week, then admitting on television that he did so because he was frustrated about a Russia probe he has called a waste of taxpayer money. \n \n Given the stakes, it now appears certain that Comey will be called out of his premature retirement to testify before Congress about the memo. He would be grilled on what Trump actually said in their Oval Office meeting on February 14 that is now at the center of the political hurricane. Comey would also face scrutiny over why he decided to keep a log of his conversations with the President that was then leaked at a moment of maximum embarrassment for the White House. \n \n JUST WATCHED Chaffetz: I\'m ready to subpoena for Comey memo Replay More Videos ...

""We\'re not going to try somebody on a piece of paper."" \n \n So far in the Trump presidency, the most important Republican leaders, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, have tried to keep the focus of their troops on implementing a conservative agenda rather than holding an unpredictable President to account. \n \n But Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich said in a CNN town hall event Tuesday that needs to change. \n \n ""I saw that Speaker (Paul) Ryan said some things tonight about getting to the bottom line,"" Kasich said. ""Frankly, I think he should be more aggressive.

MUST WATCH Comey: We follow where the evidence takes us 02:04 \n \n Comey hearing? \n \n A Comey hearing would instantly become one of the most significant congressional appearances of modern times. \n \n The practiced, analytical note-taking of a former FBI director who knows how to leave a paper trail would amount to a compelling piece of evidence in the court of public opinion and pit Comey\'s word against Trump\'s. \n \n After all, a Comey memo could approach ""smoking gun"" significance if it appears to prove that the President could conceivably be accused of obstructing justice -- potentially grounds for impeachment. \n \n A Comey appearance before a high wattage, televised hearing would mark another extraordinary dimension in a career in which the former FBI chief has found himself at the center of gripping episodes of Beltway drama. \n \n Ten years ago, Comey, then acting attorney general, rushed to a Washington hospital to thwart an attempt by White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andy Card to get a seriously ill Attorney General John Ashcroft to reauthorize a surveillance program. \n \n That intervention made him a hero for Democrats. But they came to despise Comey for his leading man role in a later drama, the probe into Hillary Clinton\'s email server. \n \n Clinton\'s campaign blames Comey for her defeat last November. He intervented late in the campaign over a new batch of emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the husband of the Democratic nominee\'s aide Huma Abedin. \n \n Trump lauded Comey for his conduct. But he soon came to loggerheads with Comey in his own administration, when the FBI director reportedly refused to offer him a vow of loyalty. Tuesday\'s reports that the President tried to get him to shelve the Flynn probe only thicken the plot. \n \n Comey\'s political misadventures may offer Republicans a chance to question his motives should he testify, and the GOP is in a mood to defend its president, whose antics in recent days have sorely tested the patience of his supporters. \n \n JUST WATCHED The wiretapping saga in 2 minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The wiretapping saga in 2 minutes 02:23 \n \n Falsehoods, exaggerations and blatant untruths \n \n But it is also possible that given his administration\'s history of repeated falsehoods, exaggerations and blatant untruths, on issues from the size of the inauguration crowds to claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, the President may not come across as a particularly credible witness in the court of public opinion. \n \n And there\'s no guarantee that the White House can get its story straight. In recent days, Trump has repeatedly contradicted his own press team as they work to defuse multiple firestorms in Washington. \n \n Since Comey would testify from Congress, and Trump can command the bully pulpit, both men, in effect would be vying for victory in the court of public opinion. \n \n Comey, in the very act of taking notes about his conversations with Trump, seems to have indicated that at the very least he considered the President a problematic character who could embroil him in future controversies. \n \n Trump has already made clear his deep antipathy to Comey. After firing him, Trump told NBC News that the FBI director was a ""showboat"" and a ""grandstander"" whom he had been planning to jettison for months. \n \n Those unflattering impressions are not likely to be improved if Trump, ever the showman himself, tunes in on cable television to watch Comey starring in a hearing that keeps the rest of the country on tenterhooks. \n \n But the result of their public duel may go a long way to dictating the fate of Trump presidency. If Trump allies fail to paint Comey as a discredited figure, he could impose deep political damage on the President. \n \n It was already immediately noticeable in the wake of Tuesday\'s disclosures that Republicans on Capitol Hill were more reticent about coming out in strong support of the President than they had been on previous occasions. \n \n A damning performance by Comey could further add to their doubts and leave Trump in deep political peril if his alleged missteps persuade even a Republican Congress to contemplate impeachment proceedings.', 'We don’t actually know if Richard Nixon ordered the break-in to the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972. \n \n That, to me, is still the most remarkable feature of the Watergate crisis. A president was forced out of office for the first time in American history by a scandal centering on a single crime, and we still don’t know if he actually ordered it. \n \n In his memoirs, Nixon denies it, though he smugly adds, ""I could not muster much moral outrage over a political bugging."" Jeb Magruder, a dirty tricks operative for Nixon, revealed three decades later that he had overheard Nixon and his reelection chair John Mitchell planning the burglary. But as historian David Greenberg notes, “Mr. Magruder had [previously] discussed that same meeting without noting Nixon\'s participation.” Dirty tricks operatives aren’t the most reliable of sources. \n \n We don’t even know why it happened — if the burglars were looking for evidence that the DNC was receiving money from the North Vietnamese or Cuban governments (as conspirator Howard Hunt insisted), or information embarrassing to White House counsel John Dean (as G. Gordon Liddy, who planned the break-in with Hunt, claimed), or, as another popular theory has it, trying to find out how much DNC chair Larry O\'Brien knew about Nixon’s financial dealings with billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes. \n \n But what we do know, the “smoking gun” that eventually forced Nixon out of office, was that Nixon ordered his chief of staff to get the CIA to force the FBI to abandon its investigation into the break-in. \n \n That was enough. \n \n Some Republicans had stood by Nixon through his firing of the independent counsel investigating the matter, through multiple aides and Cabinet officials resigning, through the White House’s effort to resist subpoenas for documents and tapes. But when the “smoking gun” White House tape was released on August 5, 1974, Nixon’s remaining support from Republicans evaporated. Two days later, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-PA), House Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes (R-AZ), and former presidential candidate Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) went to the White House and informed the president that he had no support left in Congress. \n \n They were shocked and horrified that Nixon had personally participated in the cover-up; before then there was still a sliver of a chance that the president himself wasn’t part of the conspiracy. They told Nixon that, now that his role in the cover-up was known, the votes were there to impeach him and remove him from office. The day after that, the president announced his resignation. \n \n Similarly, there’s a lot we don’t know about Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia. We know that the FBI and other agencies have been looking into any contact Trump\'s campaign advisers Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Roger Stone might have had with the Russian government during the election, as well as into White House senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s post-election contacts. We know that intelligence agencies suspect those three might have worked the Russian officials to coordinate the release of hacked emails. We know that disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Kushner, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions all lied about or failed to disclose communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \n \n We don’t know how all these pieces fit together. We don’t know exactly what Donald Trump Sr.’s direct involvement is, or how aware he was of his advisers’ efforts, or the nature of his business relationship with Russia. That’s provoked a lot of very valuable investigative journalism, as well as a lot of outright conspiracy theorizing. \n \n But focusing too granularly on the details of Trump’s personal involvement risks setting the bar too low for him. It risks suggesting that unless we find undeniable proof of collusion between Trump and the Russian government, he’s in the clear. \n \n The fact of the matter is that without any more information than we already have, we already know Trump’s conduct is at least as outrageous as what Nixon acknowledged in the smoking gun tape. \n \n In Nixon’s case, what crossed the line, moving top leaders from his own party to go to the White House and tell Nixon that his presidency was over, was Nixon’s attempt to hamper the FBI’s investigation into Watergate. \n \n And we now know that before Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked Comey to stop investigating former National Security Adviser Flynn; Comey confirms as much in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and further indicates that Trump asked him to “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation more broadly. This is exactly the same kind of FBI investigation interference that forced Nixon out of the White House and shocked his Republican allies out of defending him. \n \n We also know that Trump asked the Director of National Intelligence and the director of the National Security Agency to publicly deny the existence of collusion between his campaign and Russia — an attempt at interference in the intelligence community that calls directly to mind Nixon\'s attempt to use the CIA to scuttle an FBI probe. \n \n This is not a “where there’s smoke there’s fire” situation. We don’t need to know much more to know that the president has committed conduct that was once thought sufficient to warrant removal from office. \n \n The Comey firing isn’t smoke. It’s fire.', '""There is no cover story or obvious response to soft-pedal what Trump meant,"" said one law professor. | AP Photo Trump\'s alleged plea to Comey stirs obstruction talk Many lawyers say impeachment is only viable penalty for a president\'s actions in office. \n \n The revelation that Donald Trump allegedly urged former FBI Director James Comey to drop a probe into former adviser Michael Flynn fueled speculation the president may have obstructed justice, but any penalty would likely come from Congress and not the criminal justice system, lawyers said Tuesday. \n \n ""When someone at the White House is telling someone at DOJ or the FBI to soft-pedal or abandon an investigation, that\'s when people start talking about obstruction,"" said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n While Trump and other officials have offered a panoply of reasons for Comey\'s firing last week, the ongoing FBI probe into Russian influence on the 2016 election was cited as part of the reason for Trump\'s dissatisfaction with the FBI director\'s performance. \n \n The disclosure by the New York Times Tuesday, which was confirmed by POLITICO, that an FBI memo indicated that Trump asked Comey at a February White House meeting if he could let go of the probe into Flynn, a former campaign adviser and national security adviser, only intensified allegations the president was trying to rein in the ongoing inquiries into his associates. \n \n ""There is no cover story or obvious response to soft-pedal what Trump meant,"" Vladeck said. \n \n ""I\'m hard-pressed to think of another time that someone has put his finger on the scale as brazenly as President Trump has. If this were anyone other the president, it is classic, vanilla obstruction,"" said Jeff Cramer, a Chicago-based former federal prosecutor now with Berkeley Research Group. \n \n Trump aides dispute Comey\'s reported account of that conversation. White House officials insisted Tuesday that Trump had made no request to end the investigation. \n \n ""While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,” the White House said in a statement. Even if Comey\'s version of events proves accurate, not everyone agrees Trump\'s actions would amount to obstruction. \n \n Regardless, it would likely be up to Congress to act. While other officials alleged to have sought to stymie investigations would have to worry about criminal charges, there\'s broad consensus a president can\'t be charged criminally while he\'s in office. \n \n ""It\'s the longstanding position of the executive branch that the president cannot be indicted while in office,"" said Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, a top Justice Department official under President George W. Bush. ""The remedy for a criminal violation would be impeachment."" \n \n As the Monica Lewinsky controversy swirled around former President Bill Clinton, a Senate panel held a hearing on whether the president could be indicted. Most in Congress, including many Republicans, seemed to hold the view that the Constitution sets up impeachment as the mechanism for punishing presidential misconduct. \n \n When Independent Counsel Ken Starr believed he had ""substantial and credible"" evidence against Clinton, Starr did not seek an indictment but delivered reams of material to the House of Representatives instead. One of the articles of impeachment on which the House voted against Clinton was for obstruction of justice. The Senate acquitted Clinton on all the charges. \n \n Breaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.

Some argued that his broad constitutional authority to direct the executive branch provides a defense against such charges. They also saw ambiguities in Trump\'s reported language. \n \n ""If it was a polite request saying, \'Oh, you know, he\'s a good guy, Flynn, I wish you\'d back off this thing,\' that\'s not an obstruction of justice,"" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said on MSNBC Tuesday. ""If it was a command, it would raise stronger problems...I just think it\'s a very, very high bar to get over obstruction of justice for a president who, in fact, is the head of the unitary executive branch that includes the FBI and the Justice Department."" \n \n Another prominent defense attorney who advised a client facing obstruction of justice allegations said the evidence to make such a case against Trump was still lacking. \n \n ""Did Trump talk like this because he was actually trying to pressure Comey or was he just blowing off steam? ....If you look at the obstruction cases that are brought, they involve coercion, threats and bribes. I don\'t think we\'re there yet,"" said the lawyer, who asked not to be named. \n \n Still, the lawyer, a veteran of several Washington scandals, said Trump\'s alleged comments to Comey were unwise. \n \n ""It\'s just bad judgment. Of course, if you\'re trying to give him counsel, it\'s not anything you would want him to do or say,"" the attorney said. ""Since Watergate, the most surefire way to blow yourself up is to attempt to pressure someone lower-down in the chain....It Just doesn\'t work.""', 'Multiple news outlets are now reporting that James Comey wrote in a memo that Donald Trump asked him to drop the FBI’s investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Here’s the New York Times story that started it all: \n \n President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting. “I hope you can let this go,” the president told Mr. Comey, according to the memo. \n \n The Times does not have a copy of the memo and claims instead that a Comey associate read excerpts to a reporter: \n \n Mr. Comey shared the existence of the memo with senior F.B.I. officials and close associates. The New York Times has not viewed a copy of the memo, which is unclassified, but one of Mr. Comey’s associates read parts of the memo to a Times reporter. \n \n The Trump administration is denying Trump made the request, writing in an unsigned statement: \n \n “The president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end an investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. . . . This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.’’ \n \n The analysis here is pretty simple. If the memo exists, then there is compelling evidence that the president committed a potentially impeachable offense. Here is the alleged chain of events: First, Trump asked Comey to drop an investigation of a close former associate and a former senior official in his administration. Second, Comey refused. Third, weeks later Trump fired Comey. Fourth, Trump then misled the American people regarding the reason for the dismissal. Each prong is important, but it’s worth noting that the fourth prong — Trump’s deception regarding the reason for Comey’s termination — is particularly problematic in context. Deception is classic evidence of malign intent. \n \n If true, this is a serious abuse of power, and a Republican Congress would certainly impeach a Democrat if the roles were reversed. But — and this is vitally important to everyone at DEFCON 1 on Twitter — we don’t know yet if the New York Times account is true. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr raised reasonable objections: \n \n “I actually believe the director might have told us that there’d been a request like that and it was never mentioned by him,” the North Carolina Republican told reporters. “So somebody’s going to have to do more than have anonymous sources on this one for me to believe that there’s something there.” \n \n Lindsay Graham — no fan of Trump — also raised a legitimate point: \n \n “If this happened, the FBI director should have done something about it or quit,” Graham said. “If the president asked the FBI director to do something inappropriate, the FBI director should have said no and quit.” \n \n The bottom line is that Americans need to see the memo, if it exists. The gravity of the accusation demands immediate Congressional action. Burr’s committee should subpoena that memo and every memo or other document reflecting the content of conversations between Comey and President Trump. Do it today. Burr told reporters that the “burden is on the New York Times” to produce the memo, but that’s absurd. The Times doesn’t have the ability to compel its production. House and Senate committees do, and they need to do their job. \n \n There is no good outcome here. Either there is now compelling evidence that the president committed a serious abuse of power, or the nation’s leading press outlets are dupes for a vindictive, misleading story. Either outcome violates the public trust in vital American institutions. Either outcome results in a degree of political chaos. If the memo is real and as damaging as the Times claims, the chaos is likely greater, but don’t underestimate the cultural and political damage if our nation’s most prestigious press outlets run a story of this magnitude based on a malicious fiction. It’s time for facts and documents, not anonymity and allegations. It’s time for the truth.']",6,"– President Trump is no stranger to scandal, but reports that he asked former FBI director James Comey to halt the investigation of Michael Flynn may have taken things to the next level. The report may have been the last straw for congressional Republicans, who appeared to be shifting against Trump on Tuesday night, Politico reports. House Oversight Committee Rep. Jason Chaffetz says he has asked the FBI for Comey's memos on the Trump request and other interactions with the president and he is ready to issue subpoenas if necessary. Some legal analysts say there could now be an obstruction of justice case against Trump, though it could be tough to prove. The latest: Obstruction of justice. The New York Times describes obstruction of justice as a ""murky"" charge, the exact definition of which was being hotly debated on Capitol Hill Tuesday night. Experts say it could certainly cover asking the FBI director to drop its investigation and then firing him. Any criminal case would probably have to prove that Trump had ""corrupt intentions,"" though if Trump is tried, it will be by Congress, not the courts. ""If this were anyone other than the president, it is classic, vanilla obstruction,"" former federal prosecutor Jeff Cramer tells Politico. The showdown. It now appears certain that a ""theatrical showdown"" between Trump and Comey looms, with Americans having to decide whose word they trust more, CNN reports. Comey is expected to be called to testify before Congress about the Feb. 14 meeting with Trump. Reasons for Trump to worry. The Times' sources say Comey kept detailed memos about his meetings with Trump, which ""should strike fear into the White House,"" according to the Washington Post. The notes may describe other times Trump allegedly crossed the line—and courts in previous cases have considered memos from FBI directors to be credible evidence. ""Reasonable objections."" The National Review notes that while there is ""no good outcome"" here, it is premature to say Trump is doomed to face impeachment proceedings: The allegation has not been proven, and the ""reasonable objections"" include Sen. Lindsey Graham's observation: ""If this happened, the FBI director should have done something about it or quit."" GOP reaction. Republican lawmakers including House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Frank Meadows are calling for an investigation of the ""disturbing"" allegation. Some have signaled that their patience is wearing out. ""This weekly scandal, this weekly controversy is unhealthy for the country. It’s a major distraction for the country and it’s just bad for the psyche of every American,"" said Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, per Politico. Nixon comparisons. There are many comparisons to the Watergate scandal being made. Vox notes that what ended Richard Nixon's presidency wasn't the Watergate break-in itself—his involvement was never proven—but his attempt to force the FBI to abandon its investigation. Prison for the press. CNBC notes that amid the Flynn uproar, another allegation has been overlooked: Trump also allegedly asked Comey to consider imprisoning members of the press for publishing classified allegations that had been leaked."

That’s why my speech sucked. I thought that Jim Parsons was going to win again. Clearly, Big Bang [Theory] is at the top of its game right now. Unfortunately, he hasn’t gotten any worse right now. He’s still wonderful and I thought this would go to him. I did not for a minute think this was going to happen. So, I apologize for my speech.” — Jon Cryer, on his upset victory \n \n “Why? Because I’m better than I was before. And hopefully I’ll be better later, too. Hopefully, what I’m doing now will be considered not really that good. Whenever you leave behind failure, that means you’re doing better. If you think everything you’ve done has been great, you’re probably dumb. So, I just keep trying to get better. It’s fun to keep trying…. I’m older, too, now. Older people are smarter and funnier.” — Louis C.K., on why Louie has succeeded where his previous shows failed \n \n “You know, I was expecting a little more hostility, to be honest. I still get jokes going through security at airports, ‘Do you have a vest on?,’ you know from security guards. Again, I hark back to Band of Brothers. There’s two people out there that think I won the Second World War. So, and now they think I want to blow everybody up. People build really close relationships with TV characters. They blur reality and fiction quite often. I think that will always be the case.” — Damian Lewis, on whether fans mistake him for his would-be suicide bomber character from Homeland \n \n “The one thing I left out in my acceptance speech is I wanted to give a shout out to two women who work in television who were incredibly influential to me in the election. That’s Tina Fey and Katie Couric. I think, certainly in my research, I saw how influential they were. So, I’m sorry that I forgot to say that tonight. I really am.” — Julianne Moore, on those she failed to thank for their influence on her Emmy-winning portrayal of Sarah Palin in Game Change \n \n “High out of the reach of my son Oliver who broke the first one.” — Julie Bowen, asked where she’ going to put her statuette. \n \n “It’s going to get pretty violent, I’m sure. I’m sure Ed [O\'Neill] is going to do his Brazilian ninjitsu on me and steal it.” — Eric Stonestreet, on bringing his trophy back to the Modern Family set \n \n “Yeah, I think so. I don’t think that’s what our fans want. It’s not going to be a fairytale ending. I hope Jesse survives. I think he deserves to survive. But, I’ll see.” — Aaron Paul, asked if he’d be disappointed if Breaking Bad wrapped with a happy ending \n \n “I would say this is a hell of a lot of good fortune. I’m particularly moved to get this for a third series that I’ve done. It’s just, I mean, I need an Advil. I have a headache. I can’t believe it. I’m very thrilled and moved.” — Julia Louis-Dreyfus, on having won Emmys for three different series \n \n “When I hear our names, I can’t believe I’m living this dream here in this country. And to be able to have a show like this and my work to be playing with these people, I mean playing my character, I mean it’s a dream.

"['This was the plan to move George Zimmerman out of the Seminole County Jail and make him disappear: He would be outfitted in concealed body armor and driven away by an armed guard in a rental vehicle that had been checked to make sure no one had secretly placed a GPS tracking device on it. \n \n He would be whisked away to a tourist resort, according to a recently-released “jail escort plan,” where he would then go into the handicapped stall of the men’s bathroom and change into a new shirt, hat and glasses. \n \n Zimmerman, facing second-degree murder charges for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, would then walk to a different vehicle and be driven to a safe house. All the while, bodyguards would watch for paparazzi, “aerial” and “negative counter surveillance” and be on the lookout for people wanting to harm or humiliate their client. \n \n The plan was put together by an Orlando private detective whose company, Associated Investigative Services Inc., last week filed suit against Zimmerman and his attorney, Mark O’Mara, claiming they owe $27,000 for security services. \n \n The company’s invoices, attached to the suit, show that it billed Zimmerman and O’Mara $66,000 for 21 days of protection — an average of more than $3,100 a day — even though Zimmerman was still in the Seminole County Jail during seven of those days. \n \n During one five-day period, the agency billed Zimmerman and O’Mara more than $5,100 a day, the invoices show. \n \n O’Mara said last week that he paid the company $40,000, that the charges appeared to be exorbitant and that he never signed a contract. Zimmerman is now being protected under a plan that costs $700 a week, O’Mara said. \n \n Stephen Milbrath, the Orlando attorney who filed suit, said O’Mara was bound by an oral contract. The bodyguards took on a challenging assignment: to make a high-profile, widely hated man invisible and safe. \n \n Zimmerman, a 29-year-old Neighborhood Watch volunteer, has said he acted in self-defense, but the killing ignited racial tensions and sent thousands of people to the streets at rallies across the country. It prompted hate mail and death threats — and not just to Zimmerman but also to his parents, who abandoned their Lake Mary home and went into hiding. \n \n Zimmerman is now free on $1 million bail, living with his wife and a different bodyguard at a secret location in Seminole County, his whereabouts tracked by a GPS device. It’s not a happy life, according to O’Mara. Zimmerman is jobless, isolated and mostly stays indoors. His weight has ballooned. \n \n The bodyguards’ lawsuit, filed Dec. 21 in state circuit court in Orange County, shows the lengths to which Zimmerman has gone to stay out of sight. \n \n On June 28, according to the suit, O’Mara phoned Chris M. Rumbaugh, an Orlando private detective and former Orange County deputy, undercover drug agent and SWAT team member. \n \n Zimmerman was likely to be released from jail soon and needed a way to safely disappear then receive around-the-clock protection. \n \n Rumbaugh’s company put together the plan, according to the court documents. It’s not clear whether it was fully carried out. He did not return a phone call Thursday; neither did O’Mara. But the plan called for Zimmerman, his wife Shellie, other family members and at times, O’Mara to be protected by a seven-member team of bodyguards. \n \n The guards would take eight- or 12-hour shifts and live in a room next to the Zimmermans, at a tourist-area hotel equipped with a kitchenette, records show. The agency billed Zimmerman and O’Mara for around-the-clock protection from June 29 to July 18, the invoices show.', 'George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer facing second-degree murder charges for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, is being sued by an Orlando private company claiming they are owed $27,000 for private security services. \n \n The Miami Herald reports that Associated Investigative Services Inc. filed suit against Zimmerman and his attorney, Mark O\'Mara, for failing to pay in full a $66,000 security bill for 21 days of protection —about $3,100 dollars a day— even though Zimmerman was still in Seminole County Jail during seven of those days. \n \n The security team helped plan Zimmerman\'s exit of the Seminole County Jail, outfitting the defendant with concealed body armor while protecting him with an armed guard. He drove off in a rental vehicle that was checked for any secretly placed GPS tracking devices, the Herald said. \n \n The team planned the ""jail escort plan"" that eventually had Zimmerman dressing in disguise and changing vehicles on his way to a safe house. \n \n Zimmerman\'s lawyer, O\'Mara, claimed last week he paid the company $40,000 and that the charges were exorbitant and that he never signed a contract, according to the Herald. \n \n The attorney representing the security company, Stephen Milbrath, says Zimmerman and O\'Mara are bound by an oral contract. \n \n The Trayvon Martin shooting caused national outrage and raised racial tensions at rallies across the country who believed the shooting death of the teenager was unjustified.

Kering houses brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen. \n \n Jimmy Choo put itself up for sale in April after its majority-owner JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, signaled its intention to focus on consumer goods instead. \n \n Jimmy Choo will continue to be led by the same management team, including Creative Director Sandra Choi who joined the company at its inception. \n \n Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan acted for Michael Kors on the deal, while Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Liberum and RBC Europe acted for Jimmy Choo.']",3,"– Shoes and handbags go together like … well, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, now that the latter has agreed to purchase the former for $1.2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports. Michael Kors is looking to bolster its business with the luxury shoe brand as sales of its own handbags falter, with a Customer Growth Partners analyst noting just a 2% recent growth in the handbag market overall, as opposed to 15% growth six years ago. Reuters notes that Michael Kors has lost 65% of its market value since 2014. Michael Kors' sales may have taken a hit by the company permitting its product to be sold at a discount in outlets and department stores, making it harder to command full price in its own. The New York Times notes a big drop in shopping mall traffic as another possible contributing factor to lethargic sales. Jimmy Choo CEO Pierre Denis is expected to stay on in his current role."
"[""Former runner-up for the Miss Delaware pageant, Brittany Lewis, was awarded the crown after original winner, Amanda Longacre, was stripped of her crown due to her age. (Published Friday, June 27, 2014) \n \n Amanda Longacre, a long-time Delaware resident, has been stripped of her title as Miss Delaware 2014 because she's too old. \n \n At least that's what pageant officials are saying less than two weeks after she was crowned. \n \n The 24-year-old Bear resident says she signed her contract, with her age and birthday clearly stated, and a member of the board signed off on that contract on a local, state and national level. \n \n Carolyn Nelson, media relations coordinator for the Miss Delaware organization, confirms that that Longacre did nothing wrong and had accurately reported her birth date on applications. \n \n Still, on Tuesday, she was notified by pageant officials that her age was an issue. She was told she will not able to compete in the Miss America Pageant next September and that she was being stripped of her title, all prizes associated with that title, as well as $11,000 in scholarship money. Scholarship money that was going to help her pursue her master's degree in Social Work. \n \n “They deleted me off of everything, they’re ignoring me,” Longacre said. “They deleted me off the [Facebook] group and put up a press release announcing a new Miss Delaware.” \n \n Longacre competed twice without any issues regarding age or eligibility -- once was on the local level and again on the state level. Her birth certificate, license and social security card were provided and verified by the organization. \n \n Longacre says she was told from the beginning that her age was not an issue, that as long as she was 24 while on the Miss America stage, she was good to go. \n \n Pageant officials, however, say she has exceeded the age requirement in order to be eligible to compete in Miss America, even though she won't turn 25 until after the pageant on October 22. \n \n “I was told I could compete by people who have been doing this for 30 years,” Longacre said. “I did everything right and it was all in front of them.” \n \n Longacre was in a program for her master's at the University of Pennsylvania and had an internship at the Department of Justice. When she signed her Miss Delaware contract, she notified both groups that she wouldn’t be able to participate for a year while she fulfilled her duties as pageant winner. Now that she has been stripped of her title, she is unsure if they will take her back. \n \n “I can fulfill this job,” she said. “I did nothing morally or ethically wrong. Now I am getting all the repercussions.” \n \n Longacre has yet to receive any information from Miss America and there is no announcement on the Miss America Organization Facebook page. \n \n First runner-up Brittany Lewis of Wilmington will be awarded the crown at a news conference at Dover Downs 7:30 p.m. Thursday night."", 'Local News More>> \n \n Passenger Who Arrived At Newark Airport Being Evaluated For Ebola Passenger Who Arrived At Newark Airport Being Evaluated For Ebola A passenger who arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport from Brussels is being evaluated for possible symptoms of Ebola.The CDC says the passenger was identified during the government\'s enhanced screening procedures.The individual started their trip in Liberia.They are now in isolation at University Medical Center in Newark.This comes as tougher travel restrictions go into effect today.All travelers arriving in the U.S. from West Africa must fly into one of five airports in JFK, Newar...

"['A young Brooklyn mother pushing her baby in a stroller Thursday did what all New Yorkers do when the elevator doors open — she walked in. \n \n But the car was stuck between floors below them and the two tumbled onto its roof, with the mom’s weight crushing her infant daughter to death. \n \n The tragic accident happened at about 11:45 a.m. on the 23rd floor of 3415 Neptune Ave. — a Coney Island high-rise riddled with violations, including 45 directly related to the elevators. \n \n Aber Al-Rahabi, 21, told investigators that she didn’t notice that the elevator car wasn’t there when the doors opened — and just pushed 6-week-old Areej Ali into the open space, police sources said. \n \n The two fell several feet onto the roof of the car stuck between the 22nd and 23rd floors of the building — part of the Bay Park apartment complex. \n \n Al-Rahabi landed on top of her daughter. \n \n The impact killed the baby and sent the elevator plummeting down to the 17th floor, where first responders pulled them both out. \n \n Areej was pronounced dead a short time later at Coney Island Hospital. \n \n Salah Ali, 70, the infant’s grandfather, said the mother is in “bad shape.” \n \n “She’s in the hospital. She’s injured,” Ali told reporters at the scene. “[It] breaks my heart. That was my grandchild.” \n \n Al-Rahabi is still in the emergency room at Coney Island Hospital recovering from the accident. \n \n A neighbor said that when Areej’s father came home, he nearly passed out. “They’re all screaming and crying next door,” the neighbor added. \n \n Jeff Delacruz, who lives in the building, said his aunt spoke to the baby’s mother. “She keeps saying, ‘Everything is OK. It’s OK. God only gave me my baby for one month . . . She’s probably traumatized,” said Delacruz, 28. \n \n His wife said the elevators are always out of service. \n \n “About a week ago, the same one was out of service. The door just didn’t open,” said Elizabeth Delacruz, 26. \n \n The Bay Park complex has a “chronic problem” with its elevators, according to one of hundreds of Department of Buildings complaints. \n \n There’s one active complaint from Sept. 30 about the elevator that caused Areej’s death. \n \n Two complaints for that elevator from July 17 that have been resolved and a complaint from March 9, 2015, that says the elevator is “constantly getting out of service” and “has not been working for 2½ weeks.” \n \n There are 45 total elevator complaints dating back to 2000 at 3415 Neptune Ave. There are also 159 elevator-related violations in the complex dating back to 1994 — with 31 still active. \n \n The Department of Buildings said the elevator involved was last inspected on Aug. 8, and one nonhazardous violation was issued because the emergency phone in the car didn’t work. \n \n But DOB inspectors determined it could “safely remain in operation.” \n \n They added the elevator passed inspections in January 2016, including a thorough, “once-every-five-years inspection” where special load tests are conducted to measure the weight limits of the car. \n \n The Starrett Corporation, which owns the building, issued a statement saying: “We are saddened by today’s tragic incident . . . The incident is now under active investigation and we are cooperating fully with all authorities and agencies to determine the facts surrounding the event. We extend our deepest sympathies to the families involved and management is making arrangements to offer grief counseling upon request.”', 'NEW YORK (AP) — A 6-week-old baby died Thursday when her stroller accidentally plunged down an empty elevator shaft in a Brooklyn building. \n \n The infant\'s mother was waiting with the stroller on the 23rd floor of an apartment building in Coney Island around 11:40 a.m., officials said. \n \n When the doors opened, the woman stepped forward and both she and the stroller fell down the shaft and landed on the elevator car, which was out of service eight stories below, police said. \n \n A mechanic who had been working on the elevator heard the mother\'s screams and helped pull her to safety, police said. \n \n The circumstances of exactly where the elevator was when the woman and stroller landed on it were unclear. \n \n The baby girl, identified as Areej Ali, of Brooklyn, was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital. The mother was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries, police said. \n \n Inspectors with the city\'s Department of Buildings were at the scene investigating. \n \n ""We will be testing all of the elevators in the building to ensure they are operating safely,"" DOB spokesman Andrew Rudansky said. \n \n The elevator involved in the incident passed a thorough, ""once-every-5-years inspection"" in January, 2016, according to the buildings department. \n \n In August, the elevator received a violation because its phone wasn\'t working, but building department inspectors determined it could safely remain in operation, the DOB said. \n \n A resident of the building, Harold Noel, 37, told reporters they\'ve had problems with the elevators in the past. \n \n ""Everybody is scared to take the elevator,"" Noel said.

"['If wedding costs are an indicator of consumer confidence, Americans must be feeling pretty good about their finances right now. \n \n The average cost of a wedding last year exceeded $31,213, up 4.5% from $29,858 the previous year and an increase of 16% from a recent low of $26,984 in 2010, according to a survey of 15,800 brides by wedding website The Knot. The most expensive place to get married last year was Manhattan (an average cost of $76,328) — five times the cost of getting married in Utah, the least expensive place (where the average wedding cost just $15,257). Long Island, N.Y. ($55,327), North-Central New Jersey ($53,986), Westchester County and Hudson Valley, N.Y. ($52,954) and Chicago ($50,934) also topped the list of the most expensive places to get hitched. \n \n Of the $31,213, the highest since The Knot began tracking wedding costs in 2007, Americans will spend $14,006 on a venue, $3,587 on a reception band, $5,855 on an engagement ring, $2,556 on a photographer and $2,141 on a florist or decor. \n \n Wedding costs soar to new highs (3:40) As Americans feel better about the economy, the optimism is reflected in higher spending on weddings. Quentin Fottrell joins Lunch Break. \n \n The rest goes to such things as a wedding dress ($1,357), rehearsal dinner ($1,206) and invitations ($439) and even party favors ($275). “This shows that people are feeling better about the economy,” says Sreekar Jasthi, analyst with personal finance site NerdWallet.com. “But our research shows that the least-expensive counties spend a greater portion of their income. That’s concerning.” \n \n Read: How much should I spend on a wedding gift? \n \n Before spending so much money on one day, there are a few considerations couples might want to take into account. First, the cost of getting married in the U.S. also happens to be exactly the same — give or take $92 — as a 15% down payment on a median-priced home worth $208,700 in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to data from HSH.com, the Riverdale, N.J.-based mortgage-information firm. And, second, nearly one-fifth (17%) of couples who get married will decide to marry again (15% twice and 4% three or more times), according to a report, “Remarriage in the United States,” released this week by the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. \n \n And nearly one-quarter are destination weddings, The Knot found, which also pushes up the cost of attending — including travel and accommodation — for guests. In fact, guests spend around $592 per wedding, according to a 2014 survey by American Express. And as the cost of attending weddings increases, so does the volume of RSVPs marked “Declines with regret.” Some 43% of Americans say they’ve declined to attend a wedding for financial reasons, while 36% of people say they’ve gone into debt to attend a friend’s wedding, according to a separate 2013 poll by American Consumer Credit Counseling, a non-profit financial advisory in Auburndale, Mass. \n \n Read: The larger the rock, the rockier the marriage', ""The cost per wedding is at a five-year high \n \n Here's one sign of the U.S. economic recovery that few Americans will rejoice over: The average cost of a wedding just hit a five-year high."", '""While wedding budgets continue to rise, with the national average at $31,213, guest lists are shrinking.

In its eighth report, the wedding site reveals in a press release that when it came to the 16,000 brides and grooms married in 2014 and then surveyed, most couples split that bill evenly with the bride's parents: On average, each footed 43% of the bill, with the groom's parents chipping in 12%. In fact, only 12% of couples paid for their weddings themselves. And sticking to the budget is apparently tough: 45% of couples didn't manage to do so (another 23% didn't even make a budget). As for the dress, brides spent an average $1,357. The survey also found that the most expensive place to wed was Manhattan, where the average price tag was $76,328 (which is actually down almost $10,000 from the previous year), while the least expensive was Utah, where weddings cost less than half the national average at $15,257. Couples are spending more per head, too, as the average guest list shrunk from 149 in 2009 to 136 in 2014. On the subject of marriage and money, according to a February Redfin survey, 38% of millennials say they have or intend to put off marrying so they can afford to buy a home, reports Bloomberg Business. MarketWatch notes the average wedding price happens to be $92 less than a 15% down payment on a $208,700 home—the country's median price last quarter.

"['Donald Trump before opening the Nasdaq on September 20, 2005. Michael Nagle/Getty Images \n \n White House officials are downplaying the recent chaos in the stock market, saying it\'s a short-term wobble and insisting the US economy remains resilient. \n \n ""Look, markets do fluctuate in the short term,"" Raj Shah, a deputy White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday. ""We all know that. And they do that for a number of reasons. But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong, and they\'re headed in the right direction — for the middle class, in particular."" \n \n Stocks tanked in trading Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling as much as 1,500 points. That was a continuation of a fall from Friday, which saw the Dow close down just under 666 points. \n \n In a statement later Monday, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoed Shah\'s sentiment. \n \n ""The President\'s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening US economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers,"" Sanders said. ""The President\'s tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people."" \n \n Analysts have pointed to a slew of reasons for the sell-off, including increasing wage pressures and high valuations. \n \n President Donald Trump has long cited stock market gains as evidence of the positive effect of his presidency on the economy, even going as far as to call the stock market a good report card for his job performance. \n \n In an interview with CNN, Hogan Gidley, another White House deputy press secretary, said that despite Trump\'s taking credit for the rise, the drop should not be pinned on the president. \n \n ""It\'s still in a very strong place,"" Gidley said. ""It\'s still exorbitantly higher than it was when he took office."" \n \n The Dow closed at 18,589.69 on November 9, 2016, meaning the index is still up roughly 30% since Trump won the presidency and just over 23% since he took office in January 2017. \n \n ""On Friday, where you referenced, we also saw some really good news in the economy, which is wage growth rising at the fastest pace than it has in any point in eight years, since 2009,"" Shah said on Monday. ""Unemployment, nationally, is at 4.1%. That\'s the lowest level in almost two decades."" \n \n Shah said the recent positive economic news was directly tied to Trump\'s policies, touting wage boosts by major companies since the new tax law was enacted. \n \n The law ""is leading to hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the United States,"" Shah said. ""Hundreds of companies giving additional raises, bonuses, benefits, and everything else to employees.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2011 \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2BWn3mr', 'NEW YORK — President Donald Trump is learning a basic and painful lesson of Wall Street: Stocks also go down. \n \n A global market sell-off accelerated Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging nearly 1,600 points at one point in roller-coaster afternoon trading. After a volatile session, the Dow ended down 1,175 points, or 4.6%, at 24,346. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n It was the largest ever single-day point drop for the Dow and it rattled both Wall Street and Washington, abruptly ending a remarkable period of placid markets where it often seemed the only direction was up. A young generation of Wall Street traders has never seen the kind of whipsaw action that seized markets Monday. \n \n While the point drop was the largest, Monday’s decline did not rival some of the bloodiest days in Wall Street history given how fast the Dow has raced ahead in recent years. On Oct. 19, 1987, the notorious “Black Monday,” the blue chip average gave up nearly 23 percent of its value. On Sept. 29, 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis, the Dow sank nearly 7 percent. \n \n But it was still a large and shocking decline. It arrived amid growing concern that an economy juiced by a massive corporate tax cut, and already at full employment, could overheat and require forceful action from a new and untested Federal Reserve chairman — installed by Trump — to cool things down. \n \n On top of concerns about rising inflation, the tax cuts are already increasing the federal government’s need to borrow and accelerating the date by which Congress must raise the federal debt limit. And as of Monday, there was still no plan in Washington to raise the limit and avoid a catastrophic default. \n \n The result is that a president who tossed aside traditional presidential caution in cheerleading the stock market now stands poised to take the blame for any correction. \n \n “This is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,” said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. “Until now, Trump’s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she’s out the door and volatility is back.” \n \n Morning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time. \n \n Jerome Powell, the new Fed chair installed by Trump and sworn in Monday, is not expected to deviate sharply from Yellen’s gentle approach to raising interest rates. But he is a lesser-known figure on Wall Street. \n \n And if the recent jump in hourly wages gets pushed up even more by corporations handing out bonuses and pay bumps in the wake of the tax bill, the Fed may be forced to move faster to fight inflation — offsetting the economic benefits of the tax cuts. \n \n Interest rates are already rising as the government discloses it will have to ramp up borrowing in 2018 to make up for revenue lost to the tax-cut bill. Higher rates on government bonds make stocks look less appealing. They also can make it harder for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, possibly slowing the economy. \n \n On top of all this, stocks blew past traditional valuations as they raced ahead in 2017 and early 2018. A widely followed ratio designed by economists Robert Shiller and John Campbell that compares stock prices to corporate earnings hit 34 this year. The historic median for the ratio is 16. \n \n This could have served as a warning to Trump not to associate himself too closely with a rally that looked tenuous to many Wall Street analysts. Instead, Trump bragged about the gains at every opportunity on Twitter and even in his State of the Union address. \n \n “The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value,” Trump said in his address to Congress. \n \n Last week’s decline alone wiped out nearly $1 trillion in that value, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. \n \n Trump has regularly boasted on Twitter that the stock market rise, which actually began in 2009 at the end of the last recession, is the direct result of his policies on taxes and regulation. \n \n “Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\'t just happen!” he tweeted last August. \n \n Other senior administration officials such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have also tied the market’s gains directly to Trump policy moves. \n \n The latest declines left a White House that has basked in the glow of the market rally scrambling to explain away the massive decline and calm frayed investor nerves. \n \n “The President’s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. ""The President’s tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people.” \n \n Stocks are still far higher than they were when Trump took office, but the return of sharp volatility — and the possibility of further declines — has now put Trump in the uncomfortable position of being directly associated with daily market moves. \n \n “Presidents historically haven’t commented on the stock market anywhere near as much as President Trump has,” said Ed Yardeni, market analyst at Yardeni Research Inc. “I think Barack Obama said something in 2009 about how he thought stock prices seemed low, and that was about it. So he obviously likes to take credit for the positives. Now what does he say when the market suddenly goes down?” \n \n Dow Jones erases its gains for the year in the largest single-day point drop \n \n So far, Trump has not weighed in publicly on the market declines. A White House official sent a statement to CNBC on Monday expressing concern over the drop. “We\'re always concerned when the market loses any value, but we\'re also confident in the economy\'s fundamentals,” the statement said. \n \n Both the U.S. and global economies are in fact on stronger ground than they have been in years, leading many Wall Street analysts to suggest that the current bout of selling represents something of a healthy correction to stock market valuations and not the beginning of a bear market. \n \n Unemployment in the U.S. is low, corporate profits are strong, and growth in the first quarter is currently running as fast as 5.2 percent, according to the most recent estimate from the Atlanta Fed. Europe and Japan are also growing, a kind of synchronized global expansion not seen in recent years. \n \n “Corrections of 5% to 15% occur on average once a calendar year,” Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede, wrote in a client note Monday. “Further, history has shown the market capable of making it through such corrections and going on to positive returns for the full year period, particularly in cases of ongoing expansions.” \n \n The market may indeed quickly reverse course in the coming days and go on to move higher over the course of the year, allowing to Trump to start bragging again and possibly aiding Republicans in their efforts to tout the tax-cut bill and limit potential losses in the midterm elections. \n \n But significant risks lie ahead in Washington. The biggest is whether Powell and the Fed can navigate a difficult path between allowing the economy to thrive and wages to rise without letting potentially crushing inflation take hold. And if Powell and his colleagues decide they need to pump the brakes hard, that could leave them in direct conflict with a president not shy about criticizing people he himself put into office. \n \n And it could leave Trump with regret about jettisoning a Fed chair whom Wall Street came to love. “For the past four years, Yellen was the fairy godmother of the bull market,” said Yardeni. “And now that she’s gone, maybe we don’t get the fairy dust anymore.”']",3,"– President Trump himself hasn't addressed Monday's miserable day for the stock market, but two White House officials made a point to downplay the trouble and emphasize perspective. ""Look markets do fluctuate,"" said deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah. ""But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong."" Press chief Sarah Huckabee Sanders said similarly that the ""president's focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong."" As many outlets are now pointing out, Trump has repeatedly boasted of the booming stock market. In his recent State of the Union address, for example, he spoke of it smashing ""one record after the other,"" notes USA Today, which rounds up several tweets from Trump with a similar sentiment. Despite Monday's 1,175-point loss, the Dow is still up 23% since Trump took office, reports Business Insider. But the rough day illustrates the danger of the president taking too much credit for the market's performance, notes Politico. “This is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,” Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners tells the news site. “Until now, Trump’s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed."" Monday may have seen the biggest single-day point loss in the Dow's history, but in terms of percentage, the 4.46% loss is well below the 7% single-day drop of Sept. 29, 2008."
"['For fans of Led Zeppelin, there’s no such thing as too many remasterings and reswizzlings of those classic albums, and when a new series of reissues comes with the added bonus of previously unheard songs, it’s time to celebrate in an appropriately enormous fashion. \n \n BBC News has clips of two of the songs that will accompany the release of the band’s first three albums, this June. There’s the blues standard “Keys to the Highway” from 1970, and a not-quite-finished run through “Whole Lotta Love,” both of which should serve as appetizers for the gigantic pile of songs—a rarities disc with each album—ranging from alternate takes and live performances, including an entire Paris gig from 1969, to work-in-progress ideas and the occasional lost gem. \n \n Jimmy Page has spent the last couple of years putting the releases together from the band’s vault of recordings. And he told BBC News that the unvarnished version of a song like “Whole Lotta Love” made him aware of how much work the band put into the fine polish and extra guitars and vocals to really make it fly: “You realize just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is. \n \n “There’s all manner of bells and whistles to make it the song ‘Whole Lotta Love’ as we all know it.” \n \n That said, it’s not as if laying the songs bare has exposed an essential weakness in their sound: “It’s undeniable that we’re good,” he said. “The band was the real deal.” \n \n For Robert Plant, it has been a slightly different experience, in that there are a lot of things he rather wishes he had done differently: “My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn’t I shut up a bit? I kind of overcooked it.” \n \n But his enthusiasm for the work still shines through: “It was a particularly prolific time, where we were learning about each other’s capabilities. \n \n “Jimmy and I were just fooling around with the stuff that we would play at home. We were just trying things out. Nothing was premeditated.” \n \n And he offers firm advice for any would-be listeners: “These things aren’t to study. They’re to turn up very loud and say, hey, once upon at time, everything was just as easy as this.” \n \n See more: \n \n RIP Storm Thorgerson: 10 Of His Best Album Covers \n \n 10 Great British Bands Get Shredded \n \n Make Your Minds Up, Led Zeppelin! \n \n Five Great British Nerdy Pop Stars', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The band broke up in 1980 following the death of drummer John Bonham (second from right) \n \n Legendary rock group Led Zeppelin have unveiled two previously unheard recordings ahead of the reissue of the band\'s first three albums in June. \n \n The two tracks - blues classic Keys to the Highway, recorded in 1970, and an early version of the famous song Whole Lotta Love - are among dozens of tracks which the band will officially release alongside the reissues. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Listen to an excerpt of the new Whole Lotta Love \n \n The companion discs will feature alternative versions of songs, works in progress and live performances, all recorded at the time of the original albums. \n \n The tracks, like hundreds of others, had been carefully catalogued but then locked away in the the band\'s archive for decades. \n \n Guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, has spent two-and-a-half years combing through the vaults, listening to hundreds of quarter-inch tapes before choosing the best material. \n \n Image caption Plant says the band will not reunite again \n \n ""I don\'t want to die and have somebody else do it,"" he says.

But fans will be disappointed if they are hoping there will be another one. \n \n Page says: ""I\'m sure people would love to hear it. I\'m not the one to be asking, I don\'t sing."" \n \n Plant, however, is unequivocal. The chances of the band performing live again are, he says rolling his eyes, ""zero"". \n \n So fans will have to content themselves with the reissued albums.

Actually, it's a ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""Keys to the Highway""—previously unreleased versions that Jimmy Page culled from the band's vault in a two-year labor of love. ""I don't want to die and have somebody else do it,"" he tells the BBC, which has clips of the songs. ""I'm authoritative about what was done in the first place,"" and the new music ""deserves to be heard."" ""Keys to the Highway"" was recorded in 1970, in what Robert Plant calls ""a particularly prolific time where we were learning about each other's capabilities. Jimmy and I were just fooling around."" The ""Whole Lotta Love"" track is an early version—missing some vocals, slide guitar, the middle section, and first chorus—which makes one ""realize just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is"" in the final track, Plant says. He adds a pretty frank assessment of his own skills at the time: ""My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn't I shut up a bit? I kind of overcooked it."" He's equally blunt about any chance of a reunion: ""Zero"" chance, says he.

"[""Mobb Deep Songs Remixed: Listen to 7 of the Best \n \n The rap world is reeling from the shocking news that Prodigy, iconic rapper and one-half of Mobb Deep, died Tuesday (June 20) at age 42. He had been admitted to the hospital days earlier due to complications caused by a sickle cell anemia, a condition he'd struggled with from birth. \n \n As the music world mourns across genres and generations, we at Billboard Dance take a moment to honor his legacy with a list of remixes that best reinterpret a few of Mobb Deep's most beloved songs. No one can ever replace Prodigy, a man who inspired many young MCs to first pick up the mic, but we can continue his life by enjoying the fruits of his lifelong labor. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (Spaveech Remix) \n \n Take the ride from New York to New Jersey with Spaveech, as he puts a dance music spin on the Infamous anthem. The classic piano melody keeps things eerie, even as the house vibe gets booties moving on the dance floor. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (Izzamuzzic Remix) \n \n The influence extends to Kazakhstan as Izzamuzzic turns “Shook Ones” into a beautiful, dark modern trap anthem. Havoc and Prodigy's words up the rhythm on the slowed beat, while the hook is catchy as ever. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (DJ Premier Remix) \n \n DJ Premier is a legend in his own right. One-half of Gang Starr and a gifted producer on the solo tip, he takes a classical eye to this, one of Mobb Deep's biggest hits. It adds a flair of the cinematic, but the hip-hop drums keep this all New York hip-hop. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Survival of the Fittest” (Wonderboy Remix) \n \n Don't let the West Coast sound of this beat fool you. The Mobb Deep boys cross oceans to inspire this U.K.-based producer to cut and scratch all over this classic cut from the duo's second album, The Infamous, for an extra funky take. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Survival of the Fittest” (Benitoloco Remix) \n \n Flutes and strings up the ante on this emotive remix from the U.K.'s Benitoloco. He thrives on the classic New York hip-hop sound, twisting it with some worldly influence that has us coming back for more. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Hell on Earth” (Aesthetic Remix) \n \n This title track from Mobb Deep's third album gets a jazzy face lift, full of laid-back drums and off-center horn, string and piano notes that give the classic tune a cool new sting. There's something sinister about it, like the underlying darkness that made Mobb Deep so compelling in the first place. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Hell on Earth” (Baghiri Remix) \n \n Spanish producer Baghiri went diggin' in the crates for this classic hip-hop-style rework of “Hell on Earth.” Rain falls in the background and sets a scene of introspection as a repetitive standing bass keeps the pace. Definitely worth a few listens."", 'Mobb Deep\'s Prodigy Mourned by Nas, Just Blaze & More Hip-Hop Peers \n \n Prodigy, one-half of the legendary \'90s rap group Mobb Deep, died Tuesday (June 20) at age 42.

He was 42. \n \n The group’s publicist sent the following statement to XXL: \n \n “It is with extreme sadness and disbelief that we confirm the death of our dear friend Albert Johnson, better known to millions of fans as Prodigy of legendary NY rap duo Mobb Deep. Prodigy was hospitalized a few days ago in Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by a sickle cell anemia crisis. As most of his fans know, Prodigy battled the disease since birth. The exact causes of death have yet to be determined. We would like to thank everyone for respecting the family’s privacy at this time.” \n \n Along with his musical partner Havoc, Prodigy was a leading light of the hardcore hip-hop sound of the 1990s, and Mobb Deep’s 1995 album “The Infamous” — with its raw depictions of inner city life — was instrumental in returning New York City to the hip-hop vanguard after years of dominance from upstarts on the West Coast. \n \n Prodigy, born Albert Johnson, was raised in a musical family — his grandfather was a jazz musician, his grandmother owned a dance studio, and his mother was for a time a member of the 1960s girl-group the Crystals. His early life was marked by a degree of privilege, yet his severe sickle-cell meant chronic pain and regular hospitalizations, and he was drawn to the rough street life of his Queensbridge Houses home even as he attended private schools. “Sometimes I’d wake up with severe pain in my stomach and back, a constant throbbing like my bones were broken,” he wrote in his 2012 memoir. “Pain and I got real close in those early years.” \n \n He met Havoc, a fellow Queensbridge resident, at Manhattan’s Graphic Arts High School, and the two teenagers formed a duo, dubbed Poetical Prophets, whose demo tape was written up in influential rap bible the Source. Shortly after, they changed their name to Mobb Deep and released a debut album, “Juvenile Hell,” in 1993. The album, a rough prototype for the duo’s mixture of cold-eyed rapping and spare, dissonant beats, largely flew under the radar. But their much improved 1995 sophomore effort, “The Infamous,” brought the group to a much larger audience and featured “Shook Ones (Part II),” the track for which they are best known. The song’s influence would later spread to Oscar- and Tony-winning projects — it’s heard in the climactic scene of Eminem’s “8 Mile,” and Prodigy’s line “I’m only 19 but my mind is old” was memorably re-used by Lin-Manuel Miranda in “Hamilton.” \n \n Featuring guest appearances from Queensbridge rapper Nas, the Wu-Tang Clan’s Raekwon and A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip, “The Infamous” was bleak and uncompromising even by the standards of gangsta rap. Miles removed from the subversively jubilant mood of so many of their West Coast contemporaries, Mobb Deep’s vision of inner city violence was paranoid, cold, and deeply sad, as the titles of its standout tracks “Cradle to the Grave,” “Drink Away the Pain,” and “Survival of the Fittest” attest. The album reached No. 15 on the album charts, eventually going gold, and the group became key members of the resurgent New York hip-hop scene of the era alongside Nas and the Notorious B.I.G. \n \n Mobb Deep’s third effort, 1996’s “Hell on Earth,” largely continued in the vein of “The Infamous,” and reached No. 6 on the album chart, while topping the hip-hop chart. At the time, the group also found itself caught up in the era’s lethal East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry, and were dissed by Tupac on several tracks — the most famous of which, “Hit ‘Em Up,” mocked Prodigy’s sickle-cell anemia. Mobb Deep responded with the equally brutal “Drop a Gem on ‘Em,” which was released shortly after Tupac’s murder. \n \n In 1999, the group released its most successful album, “Murda Muzik,” which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and quickly went platinum, buoyed by single “Quiet Storm.” Soon after, they would find themselves embroiled in yet another high-profile feud, this time with Jay-Z, who famously mocked Prodigy by projecting a childhood photo of him dancing as Michael Jackson at the annual New York Summer Jam concert in 2001. Prodigy responded with “Burn” the same year. \n \n After the turn of the millennium, the group’s sound became more commercial and it released a series of indifferently received albums — including 2006’s “Blood Money,” their first as part of 50 Cent’s G-Unit clique — over the following years. Prodigy, meanwhile, had begun releasing his first solo material, starting with the No. 18-charting “H.N.I.C.” \n \n Twice arrested for weapons and drug possession charges in the mid-2000s, Prodigy was sentenced to three and a half years in prison in late 2007, and ended up serving three. Shortly after his release, he published an unusually candid autobiography, “My Infamous Life.” In 2012, Mobb Deep split for several months after a dispute on Twitter, but publicly reunited the following year. Their eighth and most recent album, “The Infamous Mobb Deep,” was released in 2014. \n \n The group continued to tour over the years and performed its last show in Las Vegas on Saturday as part of “The Art of Rap” tour with follow veteran rappers including Ghostface Killah, Onyx, KRS-One and Ice-T.', 'Mobb Deep\'s Prodigy Dies At 42 \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Bryan Bedder/Getty Images \n \n Prodigy, one-half of iconic New York rap duo Mobb Deep, has died, according to a statement provided to NPR by a publicist for the group. The statement goes on to say that the rapper, born Albert Johnson, was hospitalized ""a few days ago in Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by sickle cell anemia crisis."" Johnson battled the disease throughout his lifetime. He was 42 years old. No cause of death is known at this time. \n \n The emcee was best known for crafting narratives of struggle and survival, depicting New York in the depths of the crack era, but he had music flowing through his veins from the beginning. \n \n Prodigy\'s mother, Fatima Johnson, was a member of the \'60s R&B; group The Crystals, and also served as Mobb Deep\'s first manager. When she passed, on Christmas Eve, 2016, Prodigy publicly eulogized her on Instagram: ""I want to take a moment and salute this beautiful soul. Fatima Johnson, may u Rest In Peace,"" he wrote. ""There wouldn\'t be a Mobb Deep without you literally!! Our first manager, our first support team and believed in us when no one else did! You\'ll always always be remembered."" \n \n Prodigy co-founded the Queens-based Mobb Deep in the early \'90s, alongside partner Havoc (Kejuan Muchita). The two became synonymous with a brand of East Coast gangsta rap that represented the ill street blues, grit and grime of pre-gentrified New York City, debuting with Juvenile Hell in 1993. But it was their 1995 follow-up, The Infamous, that cemented their image and legacy. The music was dark, with eerie undertones that reflected the environmental hazards and criminal exploits of day-to-day living in the hood. \n \n ""New York got a n**** depressed / so I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess,"" Prodigy rapped on 1995\'s ""Survival of the Fittest."" \n \n The Queensbridge Houses from which they hailed and represented on record are the same, storied projects that nurtured hip-hop legends Marley Marl, MC Shan, Roxanne Shante, and Mobb Deep contemporaries Nas, Cormega, Nature, Tragedy Khadafi, and more. Like the projects, Mobb Deep\'s discography stands as a testament to the socioeconomic conditions into which they were born and bred. \n \n ""I got you stuck off the realness / we be the infamous / you heard of us / official Queensbridge murderers,"" Prodigy raps in their most memorable song, ""Shook Ones Pt. II."" Other classics among Mobb Deep\'s eight-album discography include ""Quiet Storm,"" the duo\'s 1999 collaboration with Lil\' Kim. \n \n In recent years, Prodigy had parlayed a prison sentence into a solo career, an autobiography (My Infamous Life) — even a cookbook.

In January, Prodigy released his last solo record, Hegelian Dialectic (The Book of Revelation). \n \n Albert Johnson was born in 1974 to a family filled with musicians. His mother, Fatima Johnson – then known as Francis Collins – was once a member of the Sixties girl group the Crystals, while his grandfather, Budd Johnson was an acclaimed bebop saxophonist. Throughout his childhood, however, Johnson struggled with sickle cell and a father who was both a heroin addict and a petty thief. In his 2011 autobiography, My Infamous Life, Johnson recalled the time his father left him in the car while he robbed a jewelry store. \n \n \n \n Growing up in New York City during hip-hop\'s Golden Age, Johnson eventually found his way to the mic in high school. Under the moniker Lord-T (the Golden Child), Johnson managed to score a demo deal at Jive records and earned himself a debut feature on Hi-Five\'s ""Too Young,"" which appeared on the Boyz N the Hood soundtrack. Not long after, Johnson united with Kejuan ""Havoc"" Muchita, but when Jive wouldn\'t re-sign them as a duo, the pair struck out on their own. \n \n By the time Mobb Deep released The Infamous, they\'d signed to RCA and Rifkind and Rich Isaacson\'s formative hip-hop label, Loud, whose roster also included NYC stalwarts the Wu-Tang Clan, Big Pun and Dead Prez. Following the success of The Infamous, Mobb Deep continued to hone their hardcore hip-hop sound on a string of highly successful records, 1996\'s Hell On Earth, 1999\'s Murda Muzik, and 2001\'s Infamy. \n \n During the Nineties, Mobb Deep also became embroiled in hip-hop\'s East Coast vs West Coast feud. Havoc and Prodigy guested on Capone-N-Noreaga\'s 1995 track, ""L.A., L.A.,"" a response to Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound\'s ""New York, New York,"" while the pair later became a frequent target for Tupac, who even called out Prodigy\'s sickle cell on anemia on ""When We Ride On Our Enemies."" \n \n Mobb Deep\'s hot streak continued into the 2000s. The group eventually split from Loud and created their own label, Infamous, partnering with Jive for 2004\'s Amerikaz Nightmare and 50 Cent\'s G-Unit for 2006\'s Blood Money. However, the group\'s tear was cut short in October 2006 when Prodigy was arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years, the rapper pleaded guilty and received three-and-a-half years in prison. He was released after three in March 2011 and remained on parole until 2014. \n \n \n \n Photofest \n \n Upon his release, Prodigy published his autobiography and reunited with Havoc for a new Mobb Deep song, ""Dog Shit,"" featuring Nas. But within a year, a rift between the longtime partners appeared when Havoc posted a series derogatory and homophobic messages about Prodigy on Twitter. While Havoc initially claimed that his account had been hacked, he ultimately admitted to sending the tweets during an interview with AllHipHop.com, where he also said Mobb Deep was going on ""an indefinite hiatus."" \n \n While Havoc continued to call out Prodigy, even releasing the diss track ""Separated (Real From the Fake),"" Prodigy maintained that Mobb Deep would eventually reconcile their differences. And in 2013 they did, embarking on a tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary together. A year later, they released The Infamous Mobb Deep, which featured one disc of new material and another filled with unreleased tracks from their original Infamous sessions. \n \n ""Me and Hav got a different type of relationship man,"" Prodigy told MTV in 2013. ""We been through a lot of stuff growing up, just personal stuff. When you dealing with somebody for that long every day, you\'re gonna have your little squabbles or whatever, it\'s nothing.""

"['Talk about too many cooks in the kitchen: Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign near the end of the race needed upwards of 22 people to sign off on a social media post before it could go live. \n \n That’s one of the findings in a new paper released Friday by University of North Carolina journalism professor Daniel Kreiss, who studied how both Romney and President Barack Obama used Twitter, Facebook and other online tools to shape their campaign messages. \n \n “So whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo—anything you could imagine—it had to be sent around to everyone for approval. Towards the end of the campaign that was 22 individuals who had to approve it,” Caitlin Checkett, the Romney campaign digital integration director, told Kreiss. “The digital team unfortunately did not have the opportunity to think of things on their own and post them. ... The downfall of that of course is as fast as we are moving it can take a little bit of time to get that approval to happen.” \n \n By contrast, Kreiss writes that Obama digital director Teddy Goff and his team of four social media staffers “had significantly more autonomy” to quickly respond to fast-breaking campaign events. For example, Obama’s campaign quickly responded to Clint Eastwood’s empty chair speech at the Republican National Convention by posting on Twitter a picture of Obama seated in the White House, with the message “This Seat’s Taken.” The post got almost 60,000 retweets, more than 23,800 favorites and was cited in a variety of media reports. \n \n Both the Obama and Romney campaigns also obsessed over their scripted social media attacks and rebuttals in trying to use a bit of psychology on the reporters covering the campaign, Kreiss found. \n \n Prepping for over a month ahead of their first debate, Romney’s campaign did Saturday dry runs and created 200 pre-made info-graphics. Obama’s digital team didn’t do extensive planning ahead of the first debate, but Kreiss writes that the president’s campaign was ready for the second debate by pre-writing hundreds of tweets to go up under handles for Obama, campaign manager Jim Messina or senior strategist David Axelrod. \n \n Goff told Kreiss that the Obama digital team’s job was to “make sure that no matter what was going on, frankly whether or not the president did his job, you know, there would be very loud voices talking about how we were doing well so that if we were doing well that would be perfectly clear to reporters and if we weren’t doing that well they would look at Twitter and see that it was a lot more mixed than they expected and sort of second guess their own perception that maybe the president wasn’t doing that well.” \n \n Goff also said that while the campaign probably didn’t persuade any voters through Twitter, its use of the platform still made a difference by hitting ""the somewhat elite core of supporters and then very importantly reached reporters as well.” \n \n ""So for Twitter we spent a lot of time thinking about how we could sort of manipulate the sort of national dialogue, the dialogue around politics,” he told the professor. \n \n Read more about: Mitt Romney', 'When Mitt Romney\'s digital team wanted to send out a tweet during the 2012 campaign, it wasn\'t easy for them. A new paper by Daniel Kreiss, an assistant professor at UNC Chapel Hill (and flagged by Brendan Nyhan on Twitter), finds that, late in the campaign, as many as 22 people had to sign off on the language of each tweet from the @MittRomney feed. That\'s according to Romney\'s digital integration director Caitlin Checkett, who said: \n \n CHECKETT: ""So whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo — anything you could imagine — it had to be sent around to everyone for approval. Towards the end of the campaign that was 22 individuals who had to approve it. ... The digital team unfortunately did not have the opportunity to think of things on their own and post them."" \n \n Romney\'s digital director Zac Moffatt concurred, telling Kreiss the campaign had ""the best tweets ever written by 17 people ... It was the best they all could agree on every single time."" \n \n In contrast, Kreiss finds that Obama\'s digital team had ""more autonomy,"" which made it easier for staffers ""to respond to political events in the moment and in a communicative style that accords with the norms and expectations of networked publics on Twitter."" He cites a humorous tweet from the @BarackObama feed responding to Clint Eastwood\'s ""empty chair"" Republican convention speech earlier that night. \n \n Politicians and their staffers are generally very cautious with official tweets, and that\'s understandable. There\'s little upside from most campaign tweets, and potentially a lot of downside from a Twitter blunder dominating the headlines. Still, having 17 to 22 people vet each tweet seems like a bit of an overcorrection, and makes one wonder what Romney\'s management style would have been like in the White House.']",2,"– The fast-paced world of social media wasn't quite so speedy at the Mitt Romney presidential campaign. Sure, tweets may only be 140 characters at most, but they required the approval of 22 different people ""towards the end of the campaign,"" a digital media campaign staffer says in a new study. ""Whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo—anything you could imagine—it had to be sent around to everyone,"" Caitlin Checkett told journalism professor Daniel Kreiss, as Politico reports. The campaign's digital director calls them ""the best tweets ever written by 17 people,"" Vox reports. At the Obama campaign, things were a little different. Digital head Teddy Goff's four-person team ""had significantly more autonomy"" to decide what should be posted, the study says. That made it easier to respond right away to events like Clint Eastwood's Republican convention speech. The team aimed to ""make sure that no matter what was going on—frankly, whether or not the president did his job—there would be very loud voices talking about how we were doing well,"" Goff says."

Photograph: Brook Lapping/Kessler Prod/BBC \n \n Israel has made public a decades-old handwritten plea for clemency from Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann for his role in the Holocaust, dated two days before he was executed. \n \n In the request, written after he was brought to Israel in 1960, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death, Eichmann says the Israeli court overstated his role in organising the logistics of Hitler’s Final Solution, which involved the extermination of 6 million Jews. \n \n \n \n President Reuven Rivlin presented the previously unreleased letter, which was written to then president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, at a ceremony to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n \n Hitler’s world may not be so far away | Timothy Snyder Read more \n \n “There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders,” the presidency quoted Eichmann’s letter as saying. \n \n “I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty,” the German wrote. \n \n “I am not able to recognise the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out.” \n \n The letter was signed and dated: “Adolf Eichmann Jerusalem, May 29, 1962.” \n \n He was hanged at about midnight on 31 May. \n \n Eichmann, one of the main organisers of the Holocaust, escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp after the second world war and fled to Argentina in 1950, where he lived under a pseudonym until he was snatched by Mossad agents in Buenos Aires in May 1960 and smuggled into Israel. \n \n The ability of the security services to bring him to justice was a source of pride for the Jewish state, and Rivlin referred to the trial as a momentous moment in Israel’s history. \n \n “In the first years after the Holocaust, the people in Israel were busy rebuilding and founding an independent state,” he said. “The renewed Israeli society was not in the mindset to, or able to, remember. \n \n “The Eichmann trial broke the dam of silence. The ability of the young Jewish state to capture the Nazi murderer afforded a basic sense of security to the survivors of the Holocaust.” \n \n Dismissing Eichmann’s claims to be just a bureaucrat, Rivlin said: “The people who suffered from Eichmann’s weakness were not given a moment of grace.” \n \n Israel and its allies have continued to use their resources across the globe to pursue those responsible for carrying out the Holocaust, even though the majority of perpetrators are now close to death. \n \n On Tuesday, the Simon Wiesenthal Center – named after the famous Nazi hunter – produced a list of 10 alleged Nazis who could be prosecuted in 2016.

The mistake was caused by the fact that at the time of my judgement, I was presented with a number of documents which without being seen in connection with the general material of the orders, must give an incorrect picture. \n \n It is not true that I was personally of such a high rank as to be able to persecute, or that I myself was a persecutor in the pursuit of the Jews, in the face of such an abundant rule it is clear the judges in their ruling ignored the fact that I never served in such a high position as required to be involved independently in such decisive responsibilities. Nor did I give any order in my own name, but only ever acted ‘by order of’. \n \n Even had I been as the judges assessed the driving, zealous, force in the persecution of the Jews, such a thing would have been evident in my promotion and other awards. Yet I received no such advantages. \n \n It is also incorrect that I was never influenced by human emotions. \n \n Specifically under the impression of the unspeakable horrors which I witnessed, I immediately requested a transfer to a different post. Similarly, I revealed of my own will during the police investigation, horrors which had been till then unknown in order to help establish the undisputable truth. \n \n I declare once again, as I did in the presence of the court: I detest as the greatest of crimes the horrors which were perpetrated against the Jews and think it right that the initiators of these terrible deeds will stand trial before the law now and in the future. \n \n Notwithstanding there is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders. I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty. \n \n I am not able to recognise the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr. President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out. \n \n Adolf Eichmann \n \n Jerusalem, 29.5.62"", 'High-ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann requested a pardon from Israel\'s president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi two days before was hanged to death, rare documents released in honor of International Holocaust Remembrance Day showed on Wednesday. \n \n Eichmann made the request after being found guilty of 15 charges, including crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \n \n Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter \n \n \n \n The document is one of several released ahead of an event scheduled for Wednesday at the President\'s Residence.

He said the uniform contract is “one of many” incidents that have raised eyebrows. \n \n “Contracting as usual doesn’t necessarily say that it couldn’t have been done better,” Thompson said. “As you know, DHS as a whole has been criticized because of the management and purchasing that they do.” \n \n The contract issue comes while the agency is still defending its move to allow small knives on planes — but not full-size toiletries like toothpaste or shampoo.', 'Some family members of victims killed in the Sept. 11 terror attacks said Wednesday that they are outraged by the Transportation Security Administration\'s decision to let passengers carry pocketknives on planes. \n \n FILE - In this Sept. 26, 2006, file photo, knives of all sizes and types are piled in a box at the State of Georgia Surplus Property Division store in Tucker, Ga., and are just a few of the hundreds of... (Associated Press) \n \n TSA Administrator John Pistole announced Tuesday that airline passengers will be able to carry pocketknives with blades less than 2.36 inches long and less than half an inch wide. Souvenir baseball bats, golf clubs and other sports equipment also will be permitted starting next month. \n \n The agency said the policy aligns the U.S. with international standards and allows the TSA to concentrate on more serious safety threats. \n \n Unions representing flight attendants and other airline workers decried the change, and several relatives of people killed when terrorists hijacked four U.S. airliners on Sept. 11, 2001, criticized the move as well. \n \n ""I\'m flabbergasted,"" said Sally Regenhard, whose firefighter son was killed at the World Trade Center. ""I\'m really disgusted by this latest news."" \n \n Regenhard said she recently had a container of yogurt confiscated by the TSA because it was a gel. ""I\'m just wondering why a yogurt is more dangerous than a penknife or a golf club,"" she said. \n \n Debra Burlingame, whose brother Charles was the pilot of the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, said a pocketknife can be just as deadly as a box cutter, like the ones the hijackers used. Box cutters will still be banned under the new rules. \n \n ""When you\'re drawing a blade against someone\'s neck, they\'re quite lethal,"" Burlingame said. ""This is bad news."" \n \n Burlingame said Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told interrogators that the hijackers each used ""a Swiss knife,"" a brand of pocketknife, to butcher a sheep and a camel as part of their training. The transcript of the 2003 interrogation was part of the 9/11 Commission Report. \n \n Burlingame suspects the TSA decided to allow folding knives because they are hard to spot. She said the agency\'s employees ""have a difficult time seeing these knives on X-ray screening, which lowers their performance testing rates."" \n \n Asked to respond, a TSA spokesman reiterated that ""the decision to permit these items as carry-on was made as part of TSA\'s overall risk-based security approach and aligns TSA with international standards."" \n \n Several relatives of those who died on United Flight 93, whose passengers tried to wrest control of the plane before it crashed in Shanksville, Pa., questioned the policy change. \n \n ""What\'s the difference between a pocketknife and a box cutter, for crying out loud?"" asked David Beamer, whose son Todd led the Flight 93 revolt with the words, ""Let\'s roll."" ""I cannot see the upside to this."" \n \n Alice Hoagland, whose son Mark Bingham was another leader of the attempt to take back Flight 93, called it ""a dreadful mistake to loosen the rules."" \n \n ""We are increasing the chances of flight attendants and passengers being attacked while in the air,"" said Hoagland, a retired flight attendant. ""This decision was made in order to make the TSA look a little better, to ease up on the standard so they won\'t have egg on their face."" \n \n Hamilton Peterson, who lost his father and stepmother on Fight 93, said, ""I have enormous respect for the great work of the TSA; however, I am concerned this may undermine overall counterterrorism vigilance and may well prove to be dangerous to future passengers and crew who will inherit the danger resulting from this decision.""']",2,"– Just a week before the sequester kicked in, the TSA signed a deal to spend $50 million on new uniforms, reports Politico. The agency calls the uniforms a necessity, but for many on Capitol Hill it was just another sign of the TSA's cluelessness. ""When we’re losing essential services and they’re closing down or threatening to close down all sorts of important government activities, to have them cut the deal on $50 million for uniforms is absolutely outrageous,” complains a Florida Republican. The TSA's recent announcement that it will allow small knives on flights—but still not full size shampoos and toiletries—is also angering many, including the families of people killed on 9/11, reports the AP. ""I'm really disgusted by this latest news,"" said a woman whose firefighter son was killed at the World Trade Center. Given that the 9/11 hijacks used simple box cutters, others suspect the next rules were made more for TSA screeners' convenience than safety. The agency's employees ""have a difficult time seeing these knives on X-ray screening, which lowers their performance testing rates,"" said a woman whose brother was pilot on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon. Also upset, according to the Consumerist: Air marshals and flight attendants, who are both appealing the decision. ""Flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks,"" says a top air marshal."

"['To our community, \n \n On our journey to connect the world, we often discuss products we\'re building and updates on our business. Today I want to focus on the most important question of all: are we building the world we all want? \n \n History is the story of how we\'ve learned to come together in ever greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to nations. At each step, we built social infrastructure like communities, media and governments to empower us to achieve things we couldn\'t on our own. \n \n Today we are close to taking our next step. Our greatest opportunities are now global -- like spreading prosperity and freedom, promoting peace and understanding, lifting people out of poverty, and accelerating science. Our greatest challenges also need global responses -- like ending terrorism, fighting climate change, and preventing pandemics. Progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. \n \n This is especially important right now. Facebook stands for bringing us closer together and building a global community. When we began, this idea was not controversial. Every year, the world got more connected and this was seen as a positive trend. Yet now, across the world there are people left behind by globalization, and movements for withdrawing from global connection. There are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone, and whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course. \n \n This is a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact. I am reminded of my favorite saying about technology: ""We always overestimate what we can do in two years, and we underestimate what we can do in ten years."" We may not have the power to create the world we want immediately, but we can all start working on the long term today. In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us. \n \n For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families. With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community -- for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all. \n \n Bringing us all together as a global community is a project bigger than any one organization or company, but Facebook can help contribute to answering these five important questions: \n \n How do we help people build supportive communities that strengthen traditional institutions in a world where membership in these institutions is declining? \n \n that strengthen traditional institutions in a world where membership in these institutions is declining? How do we help people build a safe community that prevents harm, helps during crises and rebuilds afterwards in a world where anyone across the world can affect us? \n \n that prevents harm, helps during crises and rebuilds afterwards in a world where anyone across the world can affect us? How do we help people build an informed community that exposes us to new ideas and builds common understanding in a world where every person has a voice? \n \n that exposes us to new ideas and builds common understanding in a world where every person has a voice? How do we help people build a civically-engaged community in a world where participation in voting sometimes includes less than half our population? \n \n in a world where participation in voting sometimes includes less than half our population? How do we help people build an inclusive community that reflects our collective values and common humanity from local to global levels, spanning cultures, nations and regions in a world with few examples of global communities? \n \n My hope is that more of us will commit our energy to building the long term social infrastructure to bring humanity together. The answers to these questions won\'t all come from Facebook, but I believe we can play a role. \n \n Our job at Facebook is to help people make the greatest positive impact while mitigating areas where technology and social media can contribute to divisiveness and isolation. Facebook is a work in progress, and we are dedicated to learning and improving. We take our responsibility seriously, and today I want to talk about how we plan to do our part to build this global community. \n \n Supportive Communities \n \n Building a global community that works for everyone starts with the millions of smaller communities and intimate social structures we turn to for our personal, emotional and spiritual needs. \n \n Whether they\'re churches, sports teams, unions or other local groups, they all share important roles as social infrastructure for our communities. They provide all of us with a sense of purpose and hope; moral validation that we are needed and part of something bigger than ourselves; comfort that we are not alone and a community is looking out for us; mentorship, guidance and personal development; a safety net; values, cultural norms and accountability; social gatherings, rituals and a way to meet new people; and a way to pass time. \n \n In our society, we have personal relationships with friends and family, and then we have institutional relationships with the governments that set the rules. A healthy society also has many layers of communities between us and government that take care of our needs. When we refer to our ""social fabric"", we usually mean the many mediating groups that bring us together and reinforce our values. \n \n However, there has been a striking decline in the important social infrastructure of local communities over the past few decades. Since the 1970s, membership in some local groups has declined by as much as one-quarter, cutting across all segments of the population. \n \n The decline raises deeper questions alongside surveys showing large percentages of our population lack a sense of hope for the future. It is possible many of our challenges are at least as much social as they are economic -- related to a lack of community and connection to something greater than ourselves. As one pastor told me: ""People feel unsettled. A lot of what was settling in the past doesn\'t exist anymore."" \n \n Online communities are a bright spot, and we can strengthen existing physical communities by helping people come together online as well as offline. In the same way connecting with friends online strengthens real relationships, developing this infrastructure will strengthen these communities, as well as enable completely new ones to form. \n \n A woman named Christina was diagnosed with a rare disorder called Epidermolysis Bullosa -- and now she\'s a member of a group that connects 2,400 people around the world so none of them have to suffer alone. A man named Matt was raising his two sons by himself and he started the Black Fathers group to help men share advice and encouragement as they raise their families. In San Diego, more than 4,000 military family members are part of a group that helps them make friends with other spouses. These communities don\'t just interact online. They hold get-togethers, organize dinners, and support each other in their daily lives. \n \n We recently found that more than 100 million people on Facebook are members of what we call ""very meaningful"" groups. These are groups that upon joining, quickly become the most important part of our social network experience and an important part of our physical support structure. For example, many new parents tell us that joining a parenting group after having a child fits this purpose. \n \n There is a real opportunity to connect more of us with groups that will be meaningful social infrastructure in our lives. More than one billion people are active members of Facebook groups, but most don\'t seek out groups on their own -- friends send invites or Facebook suggests them. If we can improve our suggestions and help connect one billion people with meaningful communities, that can strengthen our social fabric. \n \n Going forward, we will measure Facebook\'s progress with groups based on meaningful groups, not groups overall. This will require not only helping people connect with existing meaningful groups, but also enabling community leaders to create more meaningful groups for people to connect with. \n \n The most successful physical communities have engaged leaders, and we\'ve seen the same with online groups as well. In Berlin, a man named Monis Bukhari runs a group where he personally helps refugees find homes and jobs. Today, Facebook\'s tools for group admins are relatively simple. We plan to build more tools to empower community leaders like Monis to run and grow their groups the way they\'d like, similar to what we\'ve done with Pages. \n \n Most communities are made of many sub-communities, and this is another clear area for developing new tools. A school, for example, is not a single community, but many smaller groups among its classes, dorms and student groups. Just as the social fabric of society is made up of many communities, each community is made of many groups of personal connections. We plan to expand groups to support sub-communities. \n \n We can look at many activities through the lens of building community. Watching video of our favorite sports team or TV show, reading our favorite newspaper, or playing our favorite game are not just entertainment or information but a shared experience and opportunity to bring together people who care about the same things. We can design these experiences not for passive consumption but for strengthening social connections. \n \n Our goal is to strengthen existing communities by helping us come together online as well as offline, as well as enabling us to form completely new communities, transcending physical location. When we do this, beyond connecting online, we reinforce our physical communities by bringing us together in person to support each other. \n \n A healthy society needs these communities to support our personal, emotional and spiritual needs. In a world where this physical social infrastructure has been declining, we have a real opportunity to help strengthen these communities and the social fabric of our society. \n \n Safe Community \n \n As we build a global community, this is a moment of truth. Our success isn\'t just based on whether we can capture videos and share them with friends. It\'s about whether we\'re building a community that helps keep us safe -- that prevents harm, helps during crises, and rebuilds afterwards. \n \n Today\'s threats are increasingly global, but the infrastructure to protect us is not. Problems like terrorism, natural disasters, disease, refugee crises, and climate change need coordinated responses from a worldwide vantage point. No nation can solve them alone. A virus in one nation can quickly spread to others. A conflict in one country can create a refugee crisis across continents. Pollution in one place can affect the environment around the world. Humanity\'s current systems are insufficient to address these issues. \n \n Many dedicated people join global non-profit organizations to help, but the market often fails to fund or incentivize building the necessary infrastructure. I have long expected more organizations and startups to build health and safety tools using technology, and I have been surprised by how little of what must be built has even been attempted. There is a real opportunity to build global safety infrastructure, and I have directed Facebook to invest more and more resources into serving this need. \n \n For some of these problems, the Facebook community is in a unique position to help prevent harm, assist during a crisis, or come together to rebuild afterwards. This is because of the amount of communication across our network, our ability to quickly reach people worldwide in an emergency, and the vast scale of people\'s intrinsic goodness aggregated across our community. \n \n To prevent harm, we can build social infrastructure to help our community identify problems before they happen. When someone is thinking of suicide or hurting themselves, we\'ve built infrastructure to give their friends and community tools that could save their life. When a child goes missing, we\'ve built infrastructure to show Amber Alerts -- and multiple children have been rescued without harm. And we\'ve built infrastructure to work with public safety organizations around the world when we become aware of these issues. Going forward, there are even more cases where our community should be able to identify risks related to mental health, disease or crime. \n \n To help during a crisis, we\'ve built infrastructure like Safety Check so we can all let our friends know we\'re safe and check on friends who might be affected by an attack or natural disaster. Safety Check has been activated almost 500 times in two years and has already notified people that their families and friends are safe more than a billion times. When there is a disaster, governments often call us to make sure Safety Check has been activated in their countries. But there is more to build. We recently added tools to find and offer shelter, food and other resources during emergencies. Over time, our community should be able to help during wars and ongoing issues that are not limited to a single event. \n \n To rebuild after a crisis, we\'ve built the world\'s largest social infrastructure for collective action. A few years ago, after an earthquake in Nepal, the Facebook community raised $15 million to help people recover and rebuild -- which was the largest crowdfunded relief effort in history. We saw a similar effort after the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando when people across the country organized blood donations to help victims they had never met. Similarly, we built tools so millions of people could commit to becoming organ donors to save others after accidents, and registries reported larger boosts in sign ups than ever before. \n \n Looking ahead, one of our greatest opportunities to keep people safe is building artificial intelligence to understand more quickly and accurately what is happening across our community. \n \n There are billions of posts, comments and messages across our services each day, and since it\'s impossible to review all of them, we review content once it is reported to us. There have been terribly tragic events -- like suicides, some live streamed -- that perhaps could have been prevented if someone had realized what was happening and reported them sooner. There are cases of bullying and harassment every day, that our team must be alerted to before we can help out. These stories show we must find a way to do more. \n \n Artificial intelligence can help provide a better approach. We are researching systems that can look at photos and videos to flag content our team should review. This is still very early in development, but we have started to have it look at some content, and it already generates about one-third of all reports to the team that reviews content for our community. \n \n It will take many years to fully develop these systems. Right now, we\'re starting to explore ways to use AI to tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and actual terrorist propaganda so we can quickly remove anyone trying to use our services to recruit for a terrorist organization. This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide. \n \n As we discuss keeping our community safe, it is important to emphasize that part of keeping people safe is protecting individual security and liberty. We are strong advocates of encryption and have built it into the largest messaging platforms in the world -- WhatsApp and Messenger. Keeping our community safe does not require compromising privacy. Since building end-to-end encryption into WhatsApp, we have reduced spam and malicious content by more than 75%. \n \n The path forward is to recognize that a global community needs social infrastructure to keep us safe from threats around the world, and that our community is uniquely positioned to prevent disasters, help during crises, and rebuild afterwards. Keeping the global community safe is an important part of our mission -- and an important part of how we\'ll measure our progress going forward. \n \n Informed Community \n \n The purpose of any community is to bring people together to do things we couldn\'t do on our own. To do this, we need ways to share new ideas and share enough common understanding to actually work together. \n \n Giving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared. But the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality. It is our responsibility to amplify the good effects and mitigate the bad -- to continue increasing diversity while strengthening our common understanding so our community can create the greatest positive impact on the world. \n \n The two most discussed concerns this past year were about diversity of viewpoints we see (filter bubbles) and accuracy of information (fake news). I worry about these and we have studied them extensively, but I also worry there are even more powerful effects we must mitigate around sensationalism and polarization leading to a loss of common understanding. \n \n Social media already provides more diverse viewpoints than traditional media ever has. Even if most of our friends are like us, we all know people with different interests, beliefs and backgrounds who expose us to different perspectives. Compared with getting our news from the same two or three TV networks or reading the same newspapers with their consistent editorial views, our networks on Facebook show us more diverse content. \n \n But our goal must be to help people see a more complete picture, not just alternate perspectives. We must be careful how we do this. Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas, like showing people an article from the opposite perspective, actually deepen polarization by framing other perspectives as foreign. A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives, let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right. Over time, our community will identify which sources provide a complete range of perspectives so that content will naturally surface more. \n \n Accuracy of information is very important. We know there is misinformation and even outright hoax content on Facebook, and we take this very seriously. We\'ve made progress fighting hoaxes the way we fight spam, but we have more work to do. We are proceeding carefully because there is not always a clear line between hoaxes, satire and opinion. In a free society, it\'s important that people have the power to share their opinion, even if others think they\'re wrong. Our approach will focus less on banning misinformation, and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information, including that fact checkers dispute an item\'s accuracy. \n \n While we have more work to do on information diversity and misinformation, I am even more focused on the impact of sensationalism and polarization, and the idea of building common understanding. \n \n Social media is a short-form medium where resonant messages get amplified many times. This rewards simplicity and discourages nuance. At its best, this focuses messages and exposes people to different ideas. At its worst, it oversimplifies important topics and pushes us towards extremes. \n \n Polarization exists in all areas of discourse, not just social media. It occurs in all groups and communities, including companies, classrooms and juries, and it\'s usually unrelated to politics. In the tech community, for example, discussion around AI has been oversimplified to existential fear-mongering. The harm is that sensationalism moves people away from balanced nuanced opinions towards polarized extremes. \n \n If this continues and we lose common understanding, then even if we eliminated all misinformation, people would just emphasize different sets of facts to fit their polarized opinions. That\'s why I\'m so worried about sensationalism in media. \n \n Fortunately, there are clear steps we can take to correct these effects. For example, we noticed some people share stories based on sensational headlines without ever reading the story. In general, if you become less likely to share a story after reading it, that\'s a good sign the headline was sensational. If you\'re more likely to share a story after reading it, that\'s often a sign of good in-depth content. We recently started reducing sensationalism in News Feed by taking this into account for pieces of content, and going forward signals like this will identify sensational publishers as well. There are many steps like this we have taken and will keep taking to reduce sensationalism and help build a more informed community. \n \n Research suggests the best solutions for improving discourse may come from getting to know each other as whole people instead of just opinions -- something Facebook may be uniquely suited to do. If we connect with people about what we have in common -- sports teams, TV shows, interests -- it is easier to have dialogue about what we disagree on. When we do this well, we give billions of people the ability to share new perspectives while mitigating the unwanted effects that come with any new medium. \n \n A strong news industry is also critical to building an informed community. Giving people a voice is not enough without having people dedicated to uncovering new information and analyzing it. There is more we must do to support the news industry to make sure this vital social function is sustainable -- from growing local news, to developing formats best suited to mobile devices, to improving the range of business models news organizations rely on. \n \n Connecting everyone to the internet is also necessary for building an informed community. For the majority of people around the world, the debate is not about the quality of public discourse but whether they have access to basic information they need at all, often related to health, education and jobs. \n \n Finally, I want to emphasize that the vast majority of conversations on Facebook are social, not ideological. They\'re friends sharing jokes and families staying in touch across cities. They\'re people finding groups, whether they\'re new parents raising kids or newly diagnosed patients suffering from a disease together. Sometimes it\'s for joy, coming together around religion or sports. And sometimes it\'s for survival, like refugees communicating to find shelter. \n \n Whatever your situation when you enter our community, our commitment is to continue improving our tools to give you the power to share your experience. By increasing the diversity of our ideas and strengthening our common understanding, our community can have the greatest positive impact on the world. \n \n Civically-Engaged Community \n \n Our society will reflect our collective values only if we engage in the civic process and participate in self-governance. There are two distinct types of social infrastructure that must be built: \n \n The first encourages engagement in existing political processes: voting, engaging with issues and representatives, speaking out, and sometimes organizing. Only through dramatically greater engagement can we ensure these political processes reflect our values. \n \n The second is establishing a new process for citizens worldwide to participate in collective decision-making. Our world is more connected than ever, and we face global problems that span national boundaries. As the largest global community, Facebook can explore examples of how community governance might work at scale. \n \n The starting point for civic engagement in the existing political process is to support voting across the world. It is striking that only about half of Americans eligible to vote participate in elections. This is low compared to other countries, but democracy is receding in many countries and there is a large opportunity across the world to encourage civic participation. \n \n In the United States election last year, we helped more than 2 million people register to vote and then go vote. This was among the largest voter turnout efforts in history, and larger than those of both major parties combined. In every election around the world, we keep improving our tools to help more people register and vote, and we hope to eventually enable hundreds of millions of more people to vote in elections than do today, in every democratic country around the world. \n \n Local civic engagement is a big opportunity as well as national. Today, most of us do not even know who our local representatives are, but many policies impacting our lives are local, and this is where our participation has the greatest influence. Research suggests reading local news is directly correlated with local civic engagement. This shows how building an informed community, supportive local communities, and a civically-engaged community are all related. \n \n Beyond voting, the greatest opportunity is helping people stay engaged with the issues that matter to them every day, not just every few years at the ballot box. We can help establish direct dialogue and accountability between people and our elected leaders. In India, Prime Minister Modi has asked his ministers to share their meetings and information on Facebook so they can hear direct feedback from citizens. In Kenya, whole villages are in WhatsApp groups together, including their representatives. In recent campaigns around the world -- from India and Indonesia across Europe to the United States -- we\'ve seen the candidate with the largest and most engaged following on Facebook usually wins. Just as TV became the primary medium for civic communication in the 1960s, social media is becoming this in the 21st century. \n \n This creates an opportunity for us to connect with our representatives at all levels. In the last few months, we have already helped our community double the number of connections between people and our representatives by making it easier to connect with all our representatives in one click. When we connect, we can engage directly in comments and messages. For example, in Iceland, it\'s common to tag politicians in group discussions so they can take community issues to parliament. \n \n Sometimes people must speak out and demonstrate for what they believe is right. From Tahrir Square to the Tea Party -- our community organizes these demonstrations using our infrastructure for events and groups. On a daily basis, people use their voices to share their views in ways that can spread around the world and grow into movements. The Women\'s March is an example of this, where a grandmother with an internet connection wrote a post that led her friends to start a Facebook event that eventually turned into millions of people marching in cities around the world. \n \n Giving people a voice is a principle our community has been committed to since we began. As we look ahead to building the social infrastructure for a global community, we will work on building new tools that encourage thoughtful civic engagement. Empowering us to use our voices will only become more important. \n \n Inclusive Community \n \n Building an inclusive global community requires establishing a new process for citizens worldwide to participate in community governance. I hope that we can explore examples of how collective decision-making might work at scale. \n \n Facebook is not just technology or media, but a community of people. That means we need Community Standards that reflect our collective values for what should and should not be allowed. \n \n In the last year, the complexity of the issues we\'ve seen has outstripped our existing processes for governing the community. We saw this in errors taking down newsworthy videos related to Black Lives Matter and police violence, and in removing the historical Terror of War photo from Vietnam. We\'ve seen this in misclassifying hate speech in political debates in both directions -- taking down accounts and content that should be left up and leaving up content that was hateful and should be taken down. Both the number of issues and their cultural importance has increased recently. \n \n This has been painful for me because I often agree with those criticizing us that we\'re making mistakes. These mistakes are almost never because we hold ideological positions at odds with the community, but instead are operational scaling issues. Our guiding philosophy for the Community Standards is to try to reflect the cultural norms of our community. When in doubt, we always favor giving people the power to share more. \n \n There are a few reasons for the increase in issues we\'ve seen: cultural norms are shifting, cultures are different around the world, and people are sensitive to different things. \n \n First, our community is evolving from its origin connecting us with family and friends to now becoming a source of news and public discourse as well. With this cultural shift, our Community Standards must adapt to permit more newsworthy and historical content, even if some is objectionable. For example, an extremely violent video of someone dying would have been marked as disturbing and taken down. However, now that we use Live to capture the news and we post videos to protest violence, our standards must adapt. Similarly, a photo depicting any child nudity would have always been taken down -- and for good reason -- but we\'ve now adapted our standards to allow historically important content like the Terror of War photo. These issues reflect a need to update our standards to meet evolving expectations from our community. \n \n Second, our community spans many countries and cultures, and the norms are different in each region. It\'s not surprising that Europeans more frequently find fault with taking down images depicting nudity, since some European cultures are more accepting of nudity than, for example, many communities in the Middle East or Asia. With a community of almost two billion people, it is less feasible to have a single set of standards to govern the entire community so we need to evolve towards a system of more local governance. \n \n Third, even within a given culture, we have different opinions on what we want to see and what is objectionable. I may be okay with more politically charged speech but not want to see anything sexually suggestive, while you may be okay with nudity but not want to see offensive speech. Similarly, you may want to share a violent video in a protest without worrying that you\'re going to bother friends who don\'t want to see it. And just as it\'s a bad experience to see objectionable content, it\'s also a terrible experience to be told we can\'t share something we feel is important. This suggests we need to evolve towards a system of personal control over our experience. \n \n Fourth, we\'re operating at such a large scale that even a small percent of errors causes a large number of bad experiences. We review over one hundred million pieces of content every month, and even if our reviewers get 99% of the calls right, that\'s still millions of errors over time. Any system will always have some mistakes, but I believe we can do better than we are today. \n \n I\'ve spent a lot of time over the past year reflecting on how we can improve our community governance. Sitting here in California, we\'re not best positioned to identify the cultural norms around the world. Instead, we need a system where we can all contribute to setting the standards. Although this system is not fully developed, I want to share an idea of how this might work. \n \n The guiding principles are that the Community Standards should reflect the cultural norms of our community, that each person should see as little objectionable content as possible, and each person should be able to share what they want while being told they cannot share something as little as possible. The approach is to combine creating a large-scale democratic process to determine standards with AI to help enforce them. \n \n The idea is to give everyone in the community options for how they would like to set the content policy for themselves. Where is your line on nudity? On violence? On graphic content? On profanity? What you decide will be your personal settings. We will periodically ask you these questions to increase participation and so you don\'t need to dig around to find them. For those who don\'t make a decision, the default will be whatever the majority of people in your region selected, like a referendum. Of course you will always be free to update your personal settings anytime. \n \n With a broader range of controls, content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow. Within that range, content should simply not be shown to anyone whose personal controls suggest they would not want to see it, or at least they should see a warning first. Although we will still block content based on standards and local laws, our hope is that this system of personal controls and democratic referenda should minimize restrictions on what we can share. \n \n It\'s worth noting that major advances in AI are required to understand text, photos and videos to judge whether they contain hate speech, graphic violence, sexually explicit content, and more. At our current pace of research, we hope to begin handling some of these cases in 2017, but others will not be possible for many years. \n \n Overall, it is important that the governance of our community scales with the complexity and demands of its people. We are committed to always doing better, even if that involves building a worldwide voting system to give you more voice and control. Our hope is that this model provides examples of how collective decision-making may work in other aspects of the global community. \n \n This is an important time in the development of our global community, and it\'s a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact. \n \n History has had many moments like today. As we\'ve made our great leaps from tribes to cities to nations, we have always had to build social infrastructure like communities, media and governments for us to thrive and reach the next level. At each step we learned how to come together to solve our challenges and accomplish greater things than we could alone. We have done it before and we will do it again. \n \n I am reminded of President Lincoln\'s remarks during the American Civil War: ""We can succeed only by concert. It is not \'can any of us imagine better?\' but, \'can we all do better?\' The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, act anew."" \n \n There are many of us who stand for bringing people together and connecting the world. I hope we have the focus to take the long view and build the new social infrastructure to create the world we want for generations to come. \n \n It\'s an honor to be on this journey with you. Thank you for being part of this community, and thanks for everything you do to make the world more open and connected. \n \n Mark', 'After a year of controversy over Facebook Inc.’s role in spreading misinformation and handling violent images, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg now is positioning the company as the backbone of what he hopes will be a new “social infrastructure” addressing some of humanity’s biggest problems. \n \n In a nearly 6,000-word manifesto Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg outlined ambitions for the 13-year-old social network to play a larger role in tackling issues including terrorism, disease and climate change, alongside the work of governments,...', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC Economics Editor Kamal Ahmed: Mark Zuckerberg says there are threats to ""common understanding"" \n \n Mark Zuckerberg has revealed deep-seated concerns that the tide is turning against globalisation. \n \n In an interview with the BBC, the Facebook founder said that fake news, polarised views and ""filter bubbles"" were damaging ""common understanding"". \n \n He said people had been left behind by global growth, sparking demands to ""withdraw"" from the ""connected world"". \n \n In a call to action, he said people must not ""sit around and be upset"", but act to build ""social infrastructures"". \n \n ""When I started Facebook, the mission of connecting the world was not controversial,"" he told me. \n \n ""It was as if it was a default assumption that people had; every year the world got more connected and that seems like the direction things were heading in. \n \n ""Now that vision is becoming more controversial."" \n \n Losing hope \n \n He told the BBC: ""There are people around the world that feel left behind by globalisation and the rapid changes that have happened, and there are movements as a result to withdraw from some of that global connection."" \n \n Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Anti-globalisation protests, such as this one in the Philippines, have broken out across the world. \n \n Mr Zuckerberg\'s interview comes alongside the publication of a 5,500-word letter he has written about the future of Facebook and the global economy. \n \n In it Mr Zuckerberg quotes Abraham Lincoln who spoke of acting ""in concert"", and talks about ""spiritual needs"", civic engagement and says that many people have ""lost hope for the future"". \n \n ""For a couple of decades, may be longer, people have really sold this idea that as the world comes together everything is going to get better,"" he said. \n \n Ahmed: Zuckerberg lays out his vision \n \n Zuckerberg\'s manifesto on Facebook and the future \n \n Read highlights from the interview with Facebook\'s founder \n \n Facebook AI \'will identify terrorists\' \n \n ""I think the reality is that over the long term that will be true, and there are pieces of infrastructure that we can build to make sure that a global community works for everyone. \n \n ""But I do think there are some ways in which this idea of globalisation didn\'t take into account some of the challenges it was going to create for people, and now I think some of what you see is a reaction to that. \n \n ""If people are asking the question, is the direction for humanity to come together more or not?

Mark Zuckerberg set out his 5,500-word vision for the future in a Facebook post Thursday, setting out his plans to build ""social infrastructure"" that can help the world deal with issues such as climate change and terrorism, the Wall Street Journal reports. Zuckerberg tells the BBC that Facebook's mission of connecting the world has become more controversial in recent years, and while he still believes in building a global community, it must involve helping those who feel they've been left behind by globalization. Some key points from the manifesto: Facebook's next step. ""For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families,"" Zuckerberg writes. ""With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community—for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all."" ""Meaningful communities."" Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to do more to help people connect with ""meaningful communities"" both online and offline, citing examples including the Black Fathers group. Safety measures. Facebook plans to build more infrastructure like its Safety Check, which helps people let others know they're safe during an emergency, and to help the community identify threats. ""Right now, we're starting to explore ways to use AI to tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and actual terrorist propaganda so we can quickly remove anyone trying to use our services to recruit for a terrorist organization,"" Zuckerberg writes. ""Fake news."" Zuckerberg says he wants to reduce sensationalism and polarization by making sure people see a range of viewpoints. ""Our approach will focus less on banning misinformation, and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information, including that fact checkers dispute an item's accuracy,"" he writes. Civic engagement. ""Just as TV became the primary medium for civic communication in the 1960s, social media is becoming this in the 21st century,"" Zuckerberg writes, setting out plans to boost civic engagement and help hundreds of millions of people around the world register to vote. Community standards. Zuckerberg makes it clear that he was stung by criticism of the site for taking down controversial material. He says since standards vary between users and between societies, people will be allowed to have their own settings, and ""content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow."" ""History has had many moments like today,"" Zuckerberg writes in conclusion.

(Associated Press) \n \n LONDON (AP) — British police have named the third London Bridge attacker as 22-year-old Youssef Zaghba, and said that he is believed to be an Italian national of Moroccan descent. \n \n Police said Tuesday he lived in east London and that his family has been notified, adding that he was not a ""subject of interest"" to police or the intelligence services. \n \n The other two attackers were named Monday as Khuram Shazad Butt and Rachid Redouane. \n \n The identity of the last attacker in Saturday\'s attack that left seven dead and dozens wounded came as a new search was underway in a neighborhood in east London near the home of two of the London Bridge attackers. The search in Ilford, just north of Barking, is seeking to determine whether the group had accomplices. \n \n London police have said all 12 people held since the attack late Saturday from the Barking neighborhood, have been freed. \n \n The attack, the third in Britain in three months, has raised questions over the government\'s ability to protect Britain following cuts to police numbers in recent years. The issue has become a key one in the run-up to Thursday\'s general election. \n \n Prime Minister Theresa May, who called the snap election in hopes of strengthening her mandate for discussions over Britain\'s exit from the European Union, has come under fire for the cuts to police numbers over recent years. A string of opinion polls over the past couple of weeks have pointed to a narrowing in the gap between her Conservative Party and the main opposition Labour Party. \n \n One of the attackers, Butt, had appeared in a documentary ""The Jihadis Next Door"" and was known to investigators but police said he was not believed to be plotting an attack. The second man, Rachid Redouane, had not aroused any suspicions. The three, who were wearing fake suicide vests, were shot dead during the attack. \n \n The Islamic gym where one of the London Bridge attackers trained says they saw nothing of concern during his time there. \n \n In a letter posted outside Tuesday, the Ummah Fitness Centre said staff would ""help the police in any way we can"" as investigators try to learn more about Khuram Shazad Butt, who was one of those who rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and then slashed and stabbed people in nearby Borough Market. \n \n Neighbors described Butt as an avid weightlifter and Transport for London confirmed he worked for London Underground in customer service before leaving last October. \n \n London Mayor Sadiq Khan said questions would need to be asked about what the police knew about Butt. He has said cuts in the number of police officers have had an impact on the ability to prevent attacks. \n \n Much of the area around London Bridge remained cordoned off as commuters struggled to work in the driving rain. \n \n The area around Borough Market is not expected to reopen Tuesday. \n \n The nearby London Bridge station was operational though one of the exits that leads to the cordoned off area on Borough High Street remained closed. \n \n Transport for London, which oversees the capital\'s transport network, has advised commuters to make alternative journeys as the station will be busy. \n \n A minute\'s silence was observed in Britain at 11 a.m. local time (1000 GMT) in memory of those killed during the attack. \n \n Questions remain over whether investigators had the resources to look into complaints such as those leveled by Butt\'s neighbors about his attempts to radicalize children and whether crucial opportunities were missed that could have saved lives. \n \n Saturday\'s attack was the third in as many months involving suspects who had been on the radar of British authorities. All three have been claimed by the Islamic State group. \n \n The country\'s official terror threat level remains at ""severe,"" one notch down from the highest. \n \n It had been set at ""critical"" in the days after the Manchester concert bombing on May 22 that killed 22 people — reflecting a judgment that an attack might be imminent because accomplices with similar bombs might be on the loose. \n \n It was lowered once intelligence agencies were comfortable this wasn\'t the case. Authorities have said the London attack was apparently unconnected to the Manchester bombing.']",2,"– One of the three suspects in the London Bridge attack was known to police. Khuram Shazad Butt, who may have had links to jihadist group Al-Muhajiroun, had been the subject of a Metropolitan Police investigation beginning in 2015. However, the investigation was ""prioritized in the lower echelons"" because ""there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned,"" a rep tells the BBC. A man and a woman living in east London had both contacted police about Butt, with the woman suggesting he had tried to radicalize her children. According to the Times, Butt had links to both radical Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and Mohammad Sidique Khan, who planned the 2005 London bombings. Khan worked at an Ilford fitness center that Butt, a 27-year-old father of two, would frequent to try and radicalize youth, the Times reports. Butt also appeared in a 2016 Channel 4 documentary about Islamist extremists with ties to Choudary. He was seen arguing with police after carrying an Islamic State flag. Yet Butt still managed to get a job with the London Underground. The UK citizen born in Pakistan served as a trainee customer service assistant for almost six months in 2016, per the BBC. ""People are going to look at the front pages today and they are going to say 'how on earth could we have let this guy—or possible more—through the net,'"" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says, per Buzzfeed. Police previously identified Rachid Redouane, 30, who claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, as another of the attackers. On Tuesday, they named the third: Youssef Zaghba, 22, believed to an Italian national of Moroccan descent, reports the AP. Neither he nor Redouane appeared to be on police radar prior to the attack."

Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries were seen leaving the Hurricane Club holding hands showing off their wedding rings but as they arrived at the restaurant they were a little less tactile This news gives further weight to reports that the couple are headed for a divorce. \n \n A source close to the couple has told MailOnline: ‘I don’t know when they’ll announce the split or why they got married in the first place but they are done.’ \n \n On show: Both Kim and Kris has their rings on show despite claims they have split up \n \n ‘They are divorcing. They haven’t been together for a month and while Kim has been staying in New York she has been staying in a hotel room which Kris has failed to visit.’ \n \n When contacted by MailOnline, a spokesman for William Morris Endeavor was unavailable for comment. \n \n Star magazine which recently broke the news of Demi Moore\'s marriage woes has reported that Kim may have already consulted a \'top divorce lawyer\'. \n \n The magazine claims that Humphries has been spotted partying in both Miami and New York without Kim, getting flirty with multiple women and \'acting like a single man.\' \n \n While U.S. magazine Life & Style alleges that on a recent trip to Toronto, Humphries contacted his ex-girlfriend, Bianka Kamber. The magazine also spoke to a ""Kourtney & Kim Take New York"" producer who said: \'Kim\'s mapping out 2012, including holidays, and Kris isn\'t a part of it.

Before the red carpet event the pair were seen together enjoying an early dinner.', 'Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) \n \n Rumors are swirling that Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries are on the brink of splitting, just two months into their marriage. \n \n Star reports that Kardashian may have already consulted a “top divorce lawyer,” as she was spotted on said lawyer’s floor in a New York office building. The magazine claims that Kardashian is fed up with Humphries’ partying while he is out of a job thanks to the NBA lockout. It reported that Humphries has been spotted partying in both Miami and New York without Kim, getting flirty with multiple women and “acting like a single man.” \n \n “Kris takes other girls’ cell phone numbers all the time,” a source said. “To be honest, I don’t think Kris truly loves Kim. And I don’t think he ever really did.” \n \n Life & Style alleges that on a recent trip to Toronto, Humphries contacted his ex-girlfriend, Bianka Kamber. The magazine also spoke to a “Kourtney & Kim Take New York” producer who told them, “Kim’s mapping out 2012, including holidays, and Kris isn’t a part of it. Any itineraries for the future don’t include Kris very much.” \n \n Since returning from Dubai on Sunday, Kardashian has only been spotted with her new husband once, when they went to dinner at STK Restaurant last night. But a source tells Hollywood Life that the date was just for show. “They came in kind of separated,” the witness said. \n \n Meanwhile, Kardashian took pal La La Anthony to the Angel Ball on Monday night and flew solo to last night’s Huffington Post Game Changers Awards last night. \n \n Top tawyer Robert M. Wallack says, despite the reports, he has not met with Kim to discuss any divorce. \n \n He told us, “I didn’t meet with her and I am not representing her.

But such is the life of Kim Kardashian, whose eight-week-old union with Kris Humphries will apparently fall apart any day now. “I don’t know when they’ll announce the split or why they got married in the first place but they are done,” a source tells the Daily Mail. As proof, another source says that Kim’s agent has dropped Kris as a client, and that—horrors!—there aren’t any plans for a reality show featuring the couple. The New York Post notes that other magazines are reporting similar rumors: Star says Kim may have consulted a divorce lawyer; Life & Style claims Kris got in touch with an ex. In other troubling news, the Kardashians have apparently been told that President Obama is not a fan. And they’re just shocked, shocked, that he doesn’t want his daughters watching their show, sources tell TMZ. They’re particularly surprised at the news because they apparently believe their show is educational, featuring as it does real girls tackling real problems—including health and relationships."

The researchers also are investigating whether..."", 'Exposing people to short flashes of light while they’re sleeping could provide a fast and efficient method of preventing jet lag, according to a study by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine. \n \n “This could be a new way of adjusting much more quickly to time changes than other methods in use today,” said Jamie Zeitzer, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. \n \n Zeitzer is senior author of the study, which was published online Feb. 8 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The lead author is Raymond Najjar, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at the Singapore Eye Research Institute. \n \n Researchers led by Zeitzer have been working on developing an optimal technique for using light exposure to help people adjust more quickly to changes in their sleep cycles. Current light-therapy treatments for sleep disturbances include sitting in front of bright lights for hours at a time during the day, which allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps prior to taking a trip. \n \n Night light \n \n In an earlier study, Zeitzer and his colleagues found that light therapy works best at night because the body’s circadian rhythms, which control sleep cycles, are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. \n \n In the latest study, Zeitzer and Najjar found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could further speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip. \n \n The transfer of light through the eyes to the brain does more than provide sight; it also changes the biological clock. A person’s brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. \n \n After arriving in a new time zone, the body will eventually adjust on its own, but at a slow pace of about one hour a day. Meanwhile, jet lag, which occurs because your body’s clock is still synced to your original time zone, can cause fatigue, lack of alertness, a general feeling of malaise and sometimes gastrointestinal problems. \n \n Biological ‘hacking’ \n \n Light therapy is designed to speed up the brain’s adjustment to time changes. By conducting light therapy at night, the brain’s biological clock gets tricked into adjusting to an awake cycle even when asleep. It’s a kind of “biological hacking” that fools the brain into thinking the day is longer while you get to sleep, Zeitzer said.', 'This experiment demonstrates that, in direct contrast to image-forming photoreception, the human circadian timing system has the capacity to integrate light over a millisecond time scale. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that a specific temporal pattern of light has the capacity to increase the induction of circadian phase changes to a greater extent than that observed with continuous light. As opposed to the response of the circadian timing system to light flashes, other NIF responses, including increased alertness and suppressed melatonin production, failed to show consistent responsivity to light flashes. This type of sequence of light flashes would be highly improbable to occur naturally and, as such, the response we observed is likely an unintended consequence of the circuitry of the system. \n \n Previous studies in humans have contributed to the elucidation of the characteristics of NIF photoresponses, including wavelength sensitivity (33, 36, 38), timing (49, 54), intensity (40), and photic history (41). A limited number of studies have examined the effect of the temporal pattern of light. Previous studies examining the effect of continuous long- versus short-duration (minutes) intermittent light on the NIF system have implied that the effectiveness of light in changing circadian timing declines rapidly with the duration of the light pulse (42, 43, 55). We have previously shown that much of the effectiveness of light on changing the timing of the circadian pacemaker may, in fact, be mediated within the first few milliseconds of light exposure (44). Our findings suggest that within the NIF photoresponsive structure, the circadian system appears to integrate ultrashort 2-millisecond flashes of light over time in a nonlinear fashion. This temporal integration is such that 0.95 seconds of light delivered as discreet flashes evenly distributed over an hour has the capacity to be more than 2-fold more effective on phase delaying the circadian system than an equiluminous continuous light exposure 3,800 times the duration of the flashes. This is the first demonstration to our knowledge in any species that a sequence of ultrashort intermittent light flashes can be as effective, if not more effective, in changing the phase of the circadian timing system in comparison to a continuous white light of the same spectral composition and illuminance. \n \n Circadian integration renders ultrashort flashes more efficient than continuous light. The responsivity of the circadian system to the flash sequence could be explained by the electrophysiological properties of the ipRGCs, which have a sluggish off response, in that they continue to fire for several seconds after cessation of a light stimulus (10, 56). When flashes are separated by a short ISI, the depolarization of the ipRGCs would become sustained, similar to that evoked by continuous light exposure. The higher effectiveness of flashes on circadian photoreception could arise from the additional firing of cones, which indirectly project to ipRGCs, at light onset and offset, thus generating a continuous response boosted by superimposed multiple spiking responses at each light onset and offset. Flashes seem to offer an ideal stimulus that maximizes inputs from the visual system (cones), which is optimized to be maximally responsive to rapid temporal light fluctuations, and the more sluggish melanopsin-based system that is hypothesized to integrate light exposure of long durations so as to remove the vagaries of behavior (e.g., walking in a shaded area, weather) on light exposure and its effects on circadian timing. If the flashes are too far apart (e.g., ISI = 240 s), there may be insufficient drive on ipRGCs to evoke a change in circadian timing. Although a rapid dark regeneration of cone opsin is expected after short bleaches (57–59), if the flashes are too close together (e.g., 2.5–7.6 s), there may not be enough time for the bleached fragment of cone opsin to optimally regenerate; therefore, the loss of the superimposed boost in the response renders these sequences similar to continuous light. A similar observation has previously been noted in hamsters exposed to a train of 300-millisecond light pulses separated by 300 milliseconds of dark or 300 seconds of continuous light of equal total photon density (60). While it is a possibility that requires testing, we do not believe that rods have a substantive contribution in flashes subsequent to the first one, given that they are saturated at very low illuminances of light and regenerate at a much slower pace compared with cones. \n \n Integration of light information in the retina, however, does not exclude the possibility of integration of photic drive by neurons in the SCN (61). As with the ipRGCs, SCN neurons exhibit persistent firing, even after cessation of a light stimulation (62), providing a substrate for temporal integration. Alternatively, some neurons in the SCN are activated by phases of darkness (61). While the role of these neurons and their implication in entrainment remain unclear, it is possible that the combination of the excitation by flashes of light with interspersed darkness is able to mediate the observed effects. \n \n A circadian critical fusion frequency. When flashes were separated by 2.5 to 7.6 seconds, circadian phase shift was reduced to a similar magnitude as the shift induced by continuous light. Thus, the circadian system may “perceive” this frequency of stimulation the same as it would continuous light. This is akin to the phenomenon of flicker fusion in image-forming vision, in which scotopic, rod-mediated vision has a critical fusion frequency (CFF) near 15 Hz, while cone-mediated vision reaches a CFF near 60 Hz (63). Based on our findings, we suggest that circadian CFF, after dark adaptation and under a broad band full retinal exposure to a pattern of 2-millisecond stimuli, occurs around 0.13 Hz (7.6 s ISI). As with CFF, we expect circadian CFF to vary across species (64). \n \n A dichotomy in the NIF retinohypothalamic pathways. Given the technical difficulties in assessing the effect of individual 2-millisecond light flashes on melatonin suppression or alertness changes, we cannot exclude that transient changes in these functions have occurred following each brief light exposure. Nevertheless, the absence of an ISI-dependent change in melatonin suppression and alertness over a 60-minute period under different ISIs supports the idea that light-induced circadian phase shifting is not subserved by the same neural pathways as either light-induced melatonin suppression or light-induced changes in alertness. Light-induced changes in melatonin production, alertness, and phase shift are all thought to be communicated to the brain by the ipRGCs (16, 21, 65). While light-induced melatonin suppression is often used as a proxy for the effect of light on the circadian system, our data indicate that there are at least some circumstances in which this is inaccurate. It is possible that distinct subtypes of ipRGCs in the human retina (66, 67) may subserve different NIF functions. The M1 subtype of ipRGCs is implicated mainly in phase shifting the circadian system and has a faster response, a lower intrinsic threshold, and similar extrinsic input compared with other ipRGC subtypes (67). It is therefore possible that temporal integration is limited to M1 ipRGCs and that activation of these ipRGCs with light flashes is insufficient to induce light-induced melatonin suppression or alertness. An alternative possibility is that, as discussed above, the temporal integration of light is occurring at the level of the SCN. While the retinohypothalamic tract, which arises from the ipRGCs, projects to and conveys light information to the SCN, it also projects to other brain nuclei, including the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) (68), pretectal area (16), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) (69), and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) (68, 70). The PVN is involved in the control of melatonin secretion, while the other areas (pretectal area, LHA, VLPO) are all implicated in the regulation of sleep or wake. If temporal integration in the SCN is required for the phase shifting response to flashes, despite whether similar integration occurs in the retina, it is not altogether unexpected that NIF responses, such as light-induced melatonin suppression and changes in alertness, which may not depend on the SCN, are not affected by the flashes in a dose-dependent manner. \n \n Technical considerations. There was considerable variability associated with responses to very short ISIs between the flashes of light. Some of this variability may be explained by difficulties in maintaining eyes open due to sleep inertia or anticipatory blinking, which is more likely to occur when the ISI is very short (e.g., every 2.5 s) rather than long (e.g., every 240 s). We did not record eyelid movement but did discuss with the participants the importance of remaining awake with their eyes open in the Ganzfeld dome. Light is able to penetrate through the closed eyelid in a wavelength-dependent fashion, such that approximately 3% to 14% of light is transmitted (71). We have recently shown that, given sufficient intensity, millisecond light flashes passing through the eyelid have the capacity to induce changes in circadian timing (72). Nevertheless, if a participant had his eyes closed, the retinal illuminance of the stimulus would differ from the corneal measured illuminance and could contribute to the variability of the responses to the short ISI. Future studies are necessary to discover, and potentially remove, this source of variability in the response to short ISI. \n \n It is worth mentioning that, even though we fit the observed phase shift as a function of ISI with a linear rise and exponential decay function, it is quite possible that other functions may be more appropriate for these data. This phenomenological fit, however, was chosen as most suitable after multiple tests with various models, based on known retinal and neuronal physiology. Further studies on NIF photoreception are necessary to refine these models and consecutively the fit of our data. \n \n Flashes that are 2 milliseconds in duration, such as those used in this study, are faster than the pupil constriction response (73). While the pupil constricts after the flash occurs, we have found (data not shown) that there is a persistent pupillary constriction for 29.5 ± 3.24 seconds (n = 4) after an individual flash, thereby reducing the overall input to the retina, especially for flashes with an ISI under 15 seconds. Taking into account pupillary constriction induced by both continuous and different sequences of light flashes, continuous light would still contain 850 to 18,000 times more light than the sequences of flashes used in this study. We could have, as many laboratories do, used an antimuscarinic agent to dilate the pupils to avoid the pupillary light reflex and keep it from interfering with the amount of light striking the retina. Given the potential effect of antimuscarinics on the physiologic properties of retinal ganglion cells (74), we feel that the use of such agents would have created greater uncertainty in the interpretation of our results. \n \n A final consideration is that the phase shift observed in our study under continuous light was smaller than that observed in previous studies (41, 49). This difference, however, is likely due to protocol dissimilarities in the intensity of the light exposure (49) and light history of the participants that could lead to a different sensitization of the photoreceptive system (41). \n \n Ultrashort flashes revolutionize light therapy for chronobiological disorders. Whether for mood (23, 28, 75) or circadian disorders (26), light has been shown to be an effective and safe, yet challenging therapy. Multiple modulations have been suggested for the chromaticity (76–78), intensity (79), and pattern (55, 80) of light exposures to render them optimal for clinical and personal use. Here, we show that modulation of the temporal pattern of light at the millisecond time scale can be manipulated to isolate and optimize the effects of light on the circadian timing system. Using modern lighting technologies, such as ultra-bright light-emitting diodes, flashes can also be incorporated into portable mask designs that could be controlled and timed via smart phone software to proactively phase shift and resynchronize jet-lagged travelers to their new time zone, help individuals who want to go to sleep earlier on a regular basis do so (e.g., adolescents), and work in conjunction with daytime light/dark exposure to aid adjusting shift workers. The efficiency of this light treatment is especially pronounced, as flashes have been shown to be able to phase delay the circadian system, even during sleep, when the circadian system is most sensitive to light (54), while the eyelids are closed and without altering sleep (72). This type of light exposure, therefore, opens new treatment possibilities for circadian disorders that will need to be tested in real-world clinical trials as well as possibilities for the alleviation of associated sleep, mood, cognitive, and metabolic declines.']",3,"– Researchers at Stanford University have discovered what a press release calls a ""fast and efficient"" way to stop jet lag before it starts: repeatedly flashing light into your eyes while you sleep. ""If you are flying to New York tomorrow, tonight you use the light therapy,"" Dr. Jamie Zeitzer says. ""If you normally wake up at 8am, you set the flashing light to go off at 5am. When you get to New York, your biological system is already in the process of shifting to East Coast time."" A flash every 10 seconds for one hour, used toward the end of the night, will push the body's circadian rhythm forward by about two hours, the Wall Street Journal explains. Using the flashes of light at the beginning of the night, on the other hand, will delay the circadian clock and could be helpful when the aforementioned traveler heads back to the West Coast. Current in-advance methods for dealing with jet lag and sleep-cycle issues involve continuous light administered while awake. Not only did the study find flashing lights to be more effective—they change the body's circadian rhythm up to three times faster than a steady light—they don't interrupt a person's life. ""Most people can sleep through the flashing light just fine,"" Zeitzer says in the press release. Researchers are hoping to have a light-flashing sleep mask available for consumers later this year. This same method could be used to help people who work the night shift or have seasonal affective disorder. And researchers are currently testing it on a group of teens to improve school performance. ""We’re basically looking to intentionally jet lag teens so that they can go to bed at a reasonable time,"" Zeitzer tells the Journal. (This family of five gave itself perpetual jet lag by switching to Martian time.)"
"['Investigators probing the death of ""Top Gun"" director Tony Scott said they still don\'t know why he plunged from the Vincent Thomas Bridge on Sunday. \n \n Law enforcement sources said several notes Scott left do not mention any health problems or offer solid clues about why he jumped. It\'s possible, the sources said, that authorities might never make a clear determination of motive. \n \n An autopsy was performed Monday. But, as in many cases, the coroner said a final cause of death would not be determined until toxicology and other test results became available in several weeks. \n \n Officials have not determined whether Scott had any health problems before he jumped off the San Pedro bridge but said family members have denied media reports that he was suffering from cancer. \n \n ""The family told us it is incorrect that he has inoperable brain cancer,"" said Craig Harvey, a chief with the coroner\'s office. \n \n Several people who were driving over the bridge when Scott jumped described witnessing what happened. \n \n ""He was on the roadway close to the fence looking around. He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet. He looked nervous,"" David Silva told The Times. \n \n Silva said he was a passenger in a car on the north side of the bridge and Scott was on the south side. \n \n Silva said Scott ""paused a couple of seconds and then began to climb the fence. He put his foot on the top of the fence and paused again. And then he threw himself off. I immediately thought, that guy is dead."" \n \n At first, Silva and other motorists thought the jump was an extreme-sports stunt. Then they realized the jumper didn\'t have a parachute or safety cord. \n \n Silva said he called 911 immediately. \n \n A Rancho Palos Verdes man who was driving across the bridge said the director appeared ""determined"" and ""resolute."" \n \n Eric Brill, 59, said he was returning home after visiting his mother in Laguna Woods when he spotted a man wearing multicolored clothing climbing one of the cables on the other side of the bridge. The man was ""clambering up in a very strong way,"" Brill said, something that confused him until he read later that Scott was an avid rock climber. \n \n ""It takes a while to register in your brain, because you\'re not used to seeing anything like this and for a few seconds you think it\'s some kind of mistake,"" Brill said. ""I looked more closely — perhaps it\'s a maintenance man. But I knew very soon after that it wasn\'t anyone doing maintenance."" \n \n As Brill was about to drive past Scott, he said, the director ""turned around, as if to see if someone was after him."" \n \n ""I could very, very clearly see his face,"" Brill said. ""He was very determined. He was not crying, he didn\'t look upset, he didn\'t look sad. He just looked very resolute."" \n \n Brill said he had read accounts from witnesses describing him as nervous and fidgety. \n \n ""I didn\'t see that,"" Brill said.

It was at a railroad yard beneath the 185-foot-high connector between San Pedro and Terminal Island that the British director-producer filmed reshoots of his 2010 Denzel Washington hit Unstoppable. And in 2009, Scott told Rotten Tomatoes he wanted to shoot a sequence of his planned remake of The Warriors at the location. ""I\'m hoping to get 100,000 real gang members standing on the Vincent Thomas Bridge for one shot,"" he told the movie news site in June 2009. \n \n PHOTOS: Tony Scott\'s Films: From \'Top Gun\' to \'Unstoppable\' \n \n Instead, the 68-year-old filmmaker\'s tragic end has been deemed ""a witnessed suicide"" by authorities, shocking the entertainment industry as conflicting reports about his health in recent months continue to muddy any clear sense of why he would kill himself. \n \n According to police investigators, the Top Gun and True Romance director, the younger brother of filmmaker Ridley Scott, parked his Toyota Prius on the suspension bridge and scaled an 18-foot fence at about 12:30 p.m. before throwing himself into Los Angeles Harbor. The Los Angeles Times reported that detailed contact information found inside Scott\'s car led authorities to a suicide note in his office at Scott Free Productions, the prolific film and TV company he ran with his brother. \n \n While the basic outline of Scott\'s final moments is clear, the reasons behind his actions remain shrouded in mystery. An Aug. 20 report by ABC News said that Scott, whose films include Crimson Tide, Days of Thunder and Man on Fire, suffered from inoperable brain cancer. But Los Angeles County Coroner\'s chief investigator Craig Harvey said later that day that the director\'s family -- Scott was the father of twin preteen boys with wife Donna Wilson Scott -- told investigators it was ""incorrect"" that the filmmaker had brain cancer. ABC News, which drew widespread media scrutiny, later amended its story to say Scott\'s family was unaware he had cancer. (An ABC News rep tells THR it is continuing to pursue the story and ""will issue a full retraction and apology"" if incorrect information was reported.) An autopsy conducted Aug. 20 could shed light on any Scott health problems. Ed Winter, assistant chief of investigation for the coroner\'s office, says that his office does not yet know if Scott was ill. (Any pre-existing ailments likely won\'t be determined for several weeks, once toxicology and other test results are returned.) Scott\'s publicist, Simon Halls, did not respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment about his client\'s health. \n \n STORY: Tony Scott\'s Death: Witness Says Director Was \'Determined\' Just Before Jumping From Bridge \n \n Scott -- a former commercials director who came to prominence in Hollywood with 1986\'s Top Gun -- was as busy as ever. The hard-charging filmmaker known for his worn-out red hat and penchant for cigars often juggled several projects at the same time. ""He had so much on the go,"" says a producer who worked with him. ""That\'s why this is so shocking."" \n \n After this summer\'s hit Prometheus, which he produced and Ridley directed, Scott had several high-profile projects in development. As late as Aug. 17, Scott met with Tom Cruise to research their planned Top Gun sequel for Paramount. According a source close to the project, the pair were in Nevada touring a naval air station. ""Tony was my dear friend, and I will really miss him,"" said Cruise in a statement. He and Scott also worked together on the 1990 NASCAR thriller Days of Thunder. ""He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable."" \n \n STORY: Tony Scott Spent Final Days Working With Tom Cruise on \'Top Gun 2\' \n \n Before the Top Gun sequel, Scott was expected to direct Narco Sub, which centers on a disgraced U.S. naval officer forced to pilot a submarine carrying a payload of cocaine to America, for 20th Century Fox. Scott Free has its production deal at Fox, which recently tapped writer Jeffrey Nachmanoff (Traitor) to rewrite the script. Another project, the mob thriller Potsdamer Platz, had Mickey Rourke attached, and Scott was prepping Lucky Strike, an $80 million project set in the world of jet repossession, with Vince Vaughn and Emmett/Furla Films. The status of those movies is unclear, but Scott\'s final completed project, an A&E miniseries called Coma that he executive produced, is scheduled to premiere on Labor Day. \n \n Borys Kit and Pamela McClintock contributed to this report. \n \n Email: Daniel.Miller@THR.com \n \n Twitter: @DanielNMiller']",2,"– The reason that drove Tony Scott to leap to his death from an LA bridge may never be known.

"['Updated | When the first humans left Africa around 100,000 years ago, they got shorter. \n \n The evolutionary shift helped them cope with the colder conditions—a more compact body size helped protect them from frostbite, while and shorter limbs would be less breakable when they fell—but it also appears to have come with a downside: arthritis. \n \n In a study published in Nature Genetics on Monday, scientists at Stanford University, California, have shown how variants within the GDF5 gene, which are related to reduced growth, was repeatedly favored by our ancestors as they migrated out of Africa and across the continents. \n \n But GDF5 has also been linked with osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that affects an estimated 27 million Americans. Risk increases with age—it is sometimes referred to as wear and tear arthritis—but it also has a strong genetic component. \n \n Previous research has shown how mutations in part of the GDF5 gene cause malformation in bone structure in mice. In humans, it has been associated with a shortness and joint problems, and two changes in particular are linked with a heightened risk of osteoarthritis. \n \n In the latest research, the scientists find GDF5 provided an evolutionary boost for our ancestors, with arthritis apparently a byproduct of it. ""The gene we are studying shows strong signatures of positive selection in many human populations,"" senior author David Kingsley said in a statement \n \n ""It\'s possible that climbing around in cold environments was enough of a risk factor to select for a protective variant even if it brought along an increase likelihood of an age-related disease like arthritis, which typically doesn\'t develop until late in life."" \n \n To better understand GDF5, the team studied the DNA sequences that might affect how the gene is expressed—specifically those that are known as promoters and enhancers. From this they found a previously unidentified region they called GROW1. \n \n When they looked for GROW1 in the 1,000 Genomes Project database—a huge database of genetic sequences of human populations around the world—the team found a single change that is very common in European and Asian populations, but is hardly ever seen in Africans. The team then introduced this change to mice and found it led to reduced activity in the growth of bones. \n \n They then looked at the change to the genetic variant over the course of human evolution, and found it had been repeatedly favored after Homo sapiens left Africa between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. The team says the benefits of being shorter in colder conditions probably outweighed the risk of developing osteoarthritis in later life. \n \n “Because evolutionary fitness requires successful reproduction, alleles that confer benefits at young or reproductive ages may be positively selected in populations, even if they have some deleterious consequences in post-reproductive ages,�? they wrote. \n \n Researchers believe this change could help explain why osteoarthritis is rarely seen in Africa, but is more common in other populations. Concluding, Kingsley said: ""Because it\'s been positively selected, this gene variant is present in billions of people. So even though it only increases each person\'s risk by less than twofold, it\'s likely responsible for millions of cases of arthritis around the globe. \n \n ""This study highlights the intersection between evolution and medicine in really interesting ways, and could help researchers learn more about the molecular causes of arthritis."" \n \n Jamie/Flickr \n \n Christopher Ruff, Director of the Center for Functional Anatomy and Evolution at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, says that while the findings are “fascinating and provocative,�? there are some caveats that should be considered. \n \n “For example, the first anatomically modern humans found outside of Africa (in the Middle East, and later in Europe and then East Asia) were all quite tall—height only declined after the Upper Paleolithic (20,000+ years later),�? he tells Newsweek. “Therefore, while the gene coding for shorter stature may have been present in these populations, it certainly wasn\'t selected for until much later. \n \n ""Populations living in Europe today are among the tallest in the world, in some cases exceeding even the very tall Upper Paleolithic people. This has been interpreted as a response to improved living conditions over the last 150 years, with very recent populations reaching their full ‘genetic potential.’ This implies, however, that the genetic potential is there, i.e., that they are not predestined to be short. \n \n “Finally, modern African populations vary greatly in height (even excluding Pygmies),�? he continues. “Some of this is doubtless due to environmental conditions, but it also suggests other genetic factors at work. So, I think the evolutionary basis of stature variation is likely to be quite complex.�? \n \n This story has been updated to include quotes from Christopher Ruff.', 'For the 10 million Britons suffering from arthritis, it may be cold comfort to know that they might not be alive today at all, were it not for their aching limbs. \n \n Researchers in the US have discovered that a gene mutation which increases the risk of arthritis evolved in the Ice Age to help protect our ancestors from frostbite. \n \n Around half of Europeans carry a variant of the GDF5 gene which nearly doubles the chance of developing painful joints, and also knocks around 1cm off height. \n \n Although it may seem like an evolutionary disadvantage to be shorter and less mobile, in fact, it helped early humans to ward off the freezing temperatures of the north as they ventured out of Africa for the first time around 50,000 years ago.']",2,"– Arthritis causes pain and suffering for millions of people around the world, but it's also the byproduct of an evolutionary mutation that allowed early humans to make the move from Africa to colder climates tens of thousands of years ago. Researchers at Stanford University have discovered that a genetic variation made humans shorter and more compact as a means of protecting them against frostbite in the colder temperatures of northern climates, Newsweek reports. In addition, their limbs got shorter, making them less vulnerable to breaking if people should, say, slip on ice. The downside of this evolutionary adaptation was an increase in the likelihood of osteoarthritis. The Stanford study, published Monday in Nature Genetics, shows how a variation in the GDF5 gene became more prevalent in humans moving out of Africa into colder climates 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. This variation doubles the chances of developing painful joint problems while also reducing height by about 0.4 inches on average, the Telegraph reports. And since arthritis generally doesn't develop until after the age of reproduction, the gene mutation was passed on from generation to generation. The Stanford researchers discovered that the genetic variation causing this increase in arthritis is common among Europeans but rare in African populations.

"['Photo: KUVP archives \n \n The Black Hills mountain range, which stretches from South Dakota to Wyoming, is known for its lush forests, scenic waterfalls, and dense, intricate cave systems. But 150 million years ago, humongous, long-necked dinosaurs called sauropods roamed there—and scientists just identified one of their colossal, fossilized feet. \n \n \n \n The nearly complete foot fossil, made up of 13 bones, was unearthed in 1998 from a body of rock spanning multiple states called the Morrison Formation. That area has produced a wealth of dinosaur fossils from the Late Jurassic Period, or between 155 million to 148 million years ago. Scientists there have dug up diplodocuses, allosauruses, stegosauruses—the list goes on. The staggering amount of fossils there, compared to the available scientists to examine them, is why it took two decades to identify this massive foot. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The foot seems to have belonged to some kind of brachiosaur that stretched 80 feet long, the researchers wrote in their paper published Tuesday in PeerJ. To figure that out, they used a 3D scanning technique to make computerized images of the foot bones, and compared them to other sauropod foot fossils. \n \n “It very likely is a type of brachiosaur, the kind that got famous in Jurassic Park (and then got horribly murdered in Fallen Kingdom),” Femke Holwerda, a study-author and paleontologist at the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology, told Gizmodo via email. “The only problem is that feet can rarely be diagnostic down to species level, hence the assignment to brachiosaur and not to any specific species.” \n \n The same dig site where this foot was unearthed in northeastern Wyoming also contained a separate, smaller, nearly complete brachiosaur, and a handful of other long-necked dinosaurs like diplodocuses and camarasaurs. The research team was surprised to see a brachiosaur that far north, because the animals had been thought to occupy much smaller, more southern chunks of land. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “This brachiosaur showing up in Black Hills in Wyoming brings up some questions,” says David Burnham, a paleontologist at the University of Kansas who worked on the paper. “Is it a different species than the brachiosaurs down south? Or maybe they were migrating north to south? It’s several hundreds of miles from where we thought these guys were, so we have a lot of new questions. It’s great—I welcome the new questions and opportunities for further research.” \n \n Illustration: Nobu Tamura (Wikimedia Commons) \n \n Still, the huge brachiosaur foot is notable for more than just its surprising location. At just under a meter wide, the researchers said it is the largest sauropod foot ever discovered. Philip Mannion, a paleontologist at Imperial College London who wasn’t involved with this discovery, agreed with that assessment. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n “The metatarsals do seem to be longer than those of any other known sauropod dinosaur, so in that regard this is probably the largest foot ever discovered,” Mannion told Gizmodo. “There are other species with feet that aren’t much smaller, though.” \n \n \n \n Plus, as Mannion and the study authors point out, we’ve never found the feet of the world’s largest sauropods, the titanosaur and argentinosaurus, who would surely surpass this brachiosaur in foot size. We haven’t seen those dinosaurs’ feet yet because foot fossils are notoriously elusive, according to study author Anthony Maltese, a paleontologist at the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Colorado. Throughout history, they’ve had a much higher chance of being lost in waterways or eaten by scavengers because they’re so small compared to the rest of the animal. That makes the most recent discovery an especially exciting one. \n \n “It’s great to finally have a brachiosaurus foot,” Elizabeth Freedman Fowler, a paleontologist at Dickinson State University who wasn’t involved with this work, told Gizmodo. “Getting a decently complete foot for any dinosaur is a lucky find. As we keep digging and finding more bones, we are getting an idea of just how huge each dinosaur species can truly grow. I think we are going to keep breaking the record for ‘biggest’ over and over for many years to come.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n [PeerJ]', 'The largest dinosaur foot ever found, belonging to one of the largest land animals this planet\'s ever seen, surely deserves the title ""Bigfoot"" more than Sasquatch. \n \n Excavated in 1998 by an expedition from the University of Kansas, and described in a new study published in PeerJ – the Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences, ""Bigfoot"" was discovered in the Black Hills area of Wyoming. Scientists determined the dinosaur — a very close relative of Brachiosaurus — had the biggest feet of any sauropod, and roamed the area 150 million years ago. \n \n Crew member Anthony Maltese, who is also the lead author of the study, writes that the foot was nearly 1 meter wide. It didn\'t belong to the largest dinosaur ever discovered, the study said, but ""Bigfoot"" did have particularly large feet. \n \n Maltese and his team of researchers from the U.S., Switzerland, and Germany have identified the enormous foot as belonging to an animal related to Brachiosaurus, a member of the sauropod family — you know, the dinosaurs with the long necks and tails. It\'s not only the largest sauropod foot ever identified, but also the first confirmed brachiosaur foot from the Late Jurassic period of North America. \n \n A rendering of Brachiosaurus-araucaria, or ""Bigfoot.""

A University of Kansas expedition crew member is in there for scale. Image: KUVP archives \n \n So, just how did the team connect ""Bigfoot"" to sauropods, and then determine it was, in fact, related to Brachiosaurus? Maltese and team members Emanuel Tschopp, Femke Holwerda, and David Burnham used 3D scanning and highly detailed measurements to compare the large specimen to various species of sauropod, including Camarasaurus and Diplodocus. \n \n By comparing elements of the foot — like metatarsals and phalanges — with existing examples, the scientists determined it was neither of those two, but more likely that of a brachiosaurid. \n \n And there\'s still plenty to discover. Maltese said in a press statement that the rock outcrops that produced this fossil hold many more ""fantastic dinosaur skeletons,"" and that the research team will press on with their studies from there. \n \n Personally, I\'d like to know if ""Bigfoot"" sneezed as dramatically as the Brachiosaurus in Jurassic Park.', 'Material and association \n \n The pes described herein consists of an astragalus (KUVP 142200), metatarsals I to V, four non-ungual pedal phalanges, one ungual (KUVP 129724), an additional non-ungual phalanx (KUVP 133862), and a second ungual (KUVP 144767).

During a 1998 expedition led by the University of Kansas, the sauropod pes was found underneath the tail of the Camarasaurus KUVP 129716, with the phalanges scattered around the skeleton (Fig. 1C). Metatarsals I, II, III, and IV of KUVP 129724 were closely associated, whereas metatarsal V and a pedal ungual (likely from digit III) were found nearby. Three proximal phalanges (field numbers BP013, BP194 and BP208; see Table 1) were recovered about a meter away from the metatarsals with a proximal phalanx (field number BP185) slightly further away. Phalanx KUVP 133862 was discovered during preparation of a large field jacket containing caudal elements of Camarasaurus KUVP 129716. The astragalus KUVP 142200 was collected beneath KUVP 129713. A second large claw, likely php I-2, was discovered when the site was later reopened by another excavation crew. This claw was molded and a high fidelity cast was donated to KUVP, bearing the number KUVP 144767.

The Camarasaurus KUVP 129716 was nearly complete and included almost all the pedal material in articulation. All pedal bones from this specimen are duplicated in KUVP 129724, so it is certain the large pes does not belong to this specimen. A larger Camarasaurus (KUVP 129713) was excavated in 1997, approximately 7m adjacent in the same quarry. However, this individual is also much smaller than the new pes. Finally, all proximal phalanges display a peculiar bone texture on their proximal articular surfaces. These surfaces are marked by irregularly undulating grooves generally extending from the margins towards the center. Such a texture is likely due to remodeling in response to specific stresses in vivo, supporting the interpretation that all phalanges belong to a single pes, because all the joints between metatarsals and phalanges seem to be equally affected. As specimens at this locality generally occur as discreet skeletons rather than a mass of bonebed elements, these considerations suggest it is very likely the pes is a slightly scattered assemblage of elements from a single individual.', 'As it turns out, ""Bigfoot"" was a dinosaur--a giant, plant-eating one. A new study based on fossils excavated in Wyoming reveals the largest dinosaur foot ever found and identifies it as a brachiosaur, a type of sauropod dinosaur that was among the largest land animals on Earth. The work, published today in the journal PeerJ, also confirms that 150 million years ago brachiosaurs called a huge swath of North America home. \n \n ""There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet. This beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America,"" said co-author Emanuel Tschopp, a Theodore Roosevelt Richard Gilder Graduate School postdoctoral fellow in the American Museum of Natural History\'s Division of Paleontology and author on the new PeerJ study. \n \n The foot was excavated in 1998 by an expedition team from the University of Kansas which included Anthony Maltese, now at the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado. \n \n ""It was immediately apparent that the foot, nearly a meter wide, was from an extremely large animal, so the specimen was nicknamed \'Bigfoot,\'"" said Maltese, lead author of the study. \n \n Now, after thorough preparation and examination, Maltese, Tschopp, and collaborators have identified the foot as belonging to an animal very closely related to the long-necked, long-tailed sauropod Brachiosaurus, best known as the sauropod featured in the movie Jurassic Park. The researchers used 3D scanning and detailed measurements to compare the specimen to feet from numerous dinosaur species. Their research confirms that this foot is the largest dinosaur foot discovered to date. \n \n The study also shows that brachiosaurs inhabited a huge area from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming. \n \n ""This is surprising,"" Tschopp said. ""Many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas during that time."" \n \n The rock outcrops that produced this fossil--the Black Hills region of Wyoming, famous today for tourist attractions like Deadwood and Mount Rushmore--hold many more fantastic dinosaur skeletons, says Maltese.

[Titanosaur Photos: Meet the Largest Dinosaur on Record] \n \n Researchers found the jumbo-size foot fossils in 1998, buried underneath the tail of a long-necked Camarasaurus dinosaur. These fossils are part of the Morrison Formation — a rocky expanse known for its Late Jurassic period fossils, especially its sauropods (long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs that walked on all fours), such as Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. Though the scientists aren\'t sure what species the fossils came from, it\'s likely a close relative of Brachiosaurus, which made a cameo in the 1993 film ""Jurassic Park."" \n \n A Brachiosaurus nibbles from an Araucaria tree. These dinosaurs had enormous necks and relatively short tails. The newly described dinosaur was likely a close relative of Brachiosaurus. Credit: Copyright Davide Bonadonna, Milan, Italy \n \n During the dig, the paleontologists found ""several individuals of various ages and from at least three different species,"" Tschopp said. ""This foot definitely belonged to the largest individual preserved in this quarry, but unfortunately, nothing else of it was found."" \n \n The foot — a left hindfoot — was so massive that the paleontologists from the 1998 dig nicknamed it ""Bigfoot."" But despite its gargantuan size, the foot hadn\'t been described in detail until now, said lead study researcher Anthony Maltese, curator of the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado, who also took part in the 1998 excavation. \n \n To investigate, Maltese and his colleagues used a 3D-scanning technique to take precise measurements of the mystery dinosaur\'s foot and then compared those with the foot bones of other sauropods. They found that the beast was closely related to Brachiosaurus and that it likely stood about a whopping 13 feet (4 m) tall at the hip. \n \n Given the dinosaur\'s fantastic foot size, it\'s safe to call it a titanosaur — the largest group of sauropod dinosaurs — which includes the 122-foot-long (37 m) Patagotitan and the 115-foot-long (35 m) Argentinosaurus. \n \n The newly described foot bones are slightly larger than those of the long-necked Giraffatitan sauropod dinosaur and ""considerably larger than those of Dreadnoughtus, which was reported to be one of the largest sauropods ever found."" Even so, it\'s by no means the largest dinosaur on record, the researchers wrote in the study. That\'s because foot size doesn\'t directly equate to body size. \n \n ""Some of the largest sauropods such as Argentinosaurus or Patagotitan do not preserve pedal [foot] material, but have femur lengths that considerably exceed our estimate for [the newly discovered dinosaur],"" the researchers wrote in the study. For instance, the mystery dinosaur has an estimated femur length of 6.7 feet (2 m), while Argentinosaurus had a femur length of 8.3 feet (2.5 m) and Patagotitan\'s was 7.7 feet (2.3 m), the researchers said. \n \n The finding also reveals that large brachiosaurs and their close relatives inhabited huge geographical swaths 150 million years ago, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming. \n \n ""This is surprising,"" Tschopp said in a statement. ""Many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas during that time."" \n \n The study was published online today (July 24) in the Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences. \n \n Original article on Live Science.']",5,"– ""Bigfoot"" has been found, just not the apish version. An international team of paleontologists has announced the discovery of the largest known dinosaur foot, which belonged to a close relative of the Brachiosaurus now dubbed ""Bigfoot."" Appropriately so, as a nearly complete left hind-foot fossil totaling 13 bones, found two decades ago in the Black Hills area of Wyoming alongside separate and smaller brachiosaur remains, shows the 80-foot-long sauropod had feet that were about 3 feet wide, report Live Science and Gizmodo. ""There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet,"" researcher Emanuel Tschopp explains in a release. Described in journal PeerJ, ""this beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America."" Researchers, who compared the foot to those of other dino species, believe it came from a brachiosaur that lived 150 million years ago, making it the first brachiosaur foot known to come from North America's Late Jurassic Period, per Mashable. Though it's not enough to identify a specific species, it's evidence that brachiosaurs covered a larger area of North America, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming, than previously known. ""This is surprising"" as ""many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas,"" Tschopp says. Noting the discovery occurred ""several hundreds of miles from where we thought these guys were,"" fellow researcher David Burnham will look to answer new questions: ""Is it a different species than the brachiosaurs down south? Or maybe they were migrating north to south?"" (These tire-sized dino prints hid in plain sight.)"

Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is suing President Donald Trump and wants a California judge to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement she signed... (Associated Press) \n \n LOS ANGELES (AP) — An adult film actress who has said she had sex with Donald Trump filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement and ""set the record straight,"" her lawyer said Wednesday. \n \n Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Tuesday. She alleges that the agreement she signed days before the 2016 presidential election, which prevented her from discussing the alleged sexual encounters, is ""null and void and of no consequence"" because Trump didn\'t personally sign it. \n \n Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said on morning news shows Wednesday that she wants ""to set the record straight."" He said on NBC there was ""no question"" Trump knew about the agreement, though he did not offer any proof. \n \n Avenatti said Clifford wasn\'t looking to profit from her story. But he told CBS: ""I don\'t know whether she\'s going to ultimately seek payment or not."" \n \n Clifford initially claimed she had sex with Trump once and then carried on a subsequent yearslong platonic relationship. \n \n But the lawsuit filed Tuesday refers to her beginning an ""intimate relationship"" with Trump in 2006 that continued ""well into the year 2007."" She said the relationship included encounters in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and Beverly Hills, California. Trump married his current wife, Melania Trump, in 2005. \n \n She also has also previously denied through a lawyer that the two had an affair, but Avenatti said Wednesday that was to meet the terms of the nondisclosure agreement. Trump\'s attorney Michael Cohen has denied there was ever an affair. \n \n Cohen has said he paid the porn actress $130,000 out of his own pocket as part of the agreement. He has also said that ""neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."" \n \n The lawsuit charges that the Oct. 28, 2016, ""hush agreement"" is legally invalid because it was only signed by Clifford and Cohen. The agreement refers to Trump as David Dennison and Clifford as Peggy Peterson, but an attached exhibit details their true identities. \n \n On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump has ""made very well clear that none of these allegations are true."" \n \n ""The president has denied the allegations against him and again this case has already been won in arbitration,"" Sanders said. \n \n Sanders declined to elaborate and referred additional questions to Cohen, who did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday and Wednesday. \n \n An arbitrator in California issued a temporary restraining order last week that barred Clifford from disclosing any confidential information tied to the nondisclosure agreement or details about the arbitration hearing, according to a copy of the order that was obtained by NBC News. \n \n Clifford\'s lawsuit alleges that Cohen had ""surreptitiously initiated a bogus arbitration proceeding"" against Clifford and within the last week used an ""improper and procedurally defective arbitration proceeding hidden from public view."" \n \n The suit also charges that Trump and Cohen ""aggressively sought to silence Ms. Clifford as part of an effort to avoid her telling the truth, thus helping to ensure he won the Presidential Election."" \n \n ""To be clear, the attempts to intimidate Ms. Clifford into silence and \'shut her up\' in order to \'protect Mr. Trump\' continue unabated,"" the lawsuit said. Clifford alleges that as recently as last week, Trump\'s attorney tried to initiate an arbitration proceeding against her. \n \n ___ \n \n Lucey reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.', 'Washington (CNN) Sarah Sanders was asked a simple question by CNN\'s Jeff Zeleny on Wednesday afternoon: Did President Donald Trump know that his personal lawyer made a $130,000 payment to silence a porn star alleging that she had engaged in an extramarital affair with Trump? \n \n ""Not that I\'m aware of,"" said the White House press secretary. \n \n Which, as you may have noticed, isn\'t ""no."" \n \n Now, ask yourself this: If Sanders could have said ""no"" -- flat out -- to the question of whether Trump knew that Michael Cohen was making a six-figure payment to keep a porn star from saying she had an affair with the President, don\'t you think she would have? \n \n OF COURSE SHE WOULD HAVE. \n \n Read More', 'Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said that he did not consider the restraining order, dated Feb. 27, valid, and that his client would proceed with her lawsuit in open court. “This should be decided publicly,” he said. \n \n Image The White House’s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Wednesday that the president’s lawyer had won an arbitration proceeding against the actress. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times \n \n Ms. Clifford’s nondisclosure contract, made public through her lawsuit, calls for disagreements to be settled through confidential, binding arbitration. The lawsuit was filed a week after Mr. Cohen initiated arbitration proceedings, but the court papers did not say what was at issue or refer to the restraining order. \n \n The contract gives Mr. Trump the right to seek financial penalties of more than $1 million in arbitration should Ms. Clifford break or threaten to break her agreement to stay silent. It also gives him the right to obtain an injunction barring her from speaking while disputes are considered in arbitration or open court. Those terms prompted Ms. Clifford to change her plans about going public, according to two people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to speak about it. \n \n Ms. Clifford had suggested she was free to speak out after Mr. Cohen disclosed last month that he had arranged the payment, prompting her to claim that the contract had been breached. \n \n The restraining order took her by surprise. A close friend of Ms. Clifford’s, J. D. Barrale, said in an interview that she learned Mr. Cohen initiated arbitration proceedings when she landed on a flight from Los Angeles to Texas. “She was shocked,” Mr. Barrale said. \n \n Mr. Avenatti said Ms. Clifford had “never even been provided an opportunity to respond” to Mr. Cohen’s action in arbitration. \n \n A copy of the restraining order, obtained by The Times and first reported by NBC News, left open the possibility that it could be modified in the future. But Mr. Avenatti said he questioned its validity because it was brought on behalf of Mr. Cohen, not Mr. Trump.', 'Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images. \n \n To this besieged White House, the Stephanie Clifford (aka Stormy Daniels, aka Peggy Peterson) lawsuit against President Donald Trump might only register as a single locust on the plague scale. Stormy Daniels doesn’t even represent the most interesting sex scandal the White House has to confront this week. Nevertheless, her lawsuit poses a few interesting legal questions that some poor judge in Los Angeles Superior Court will have to very publicly grapple with. \n \n The nature of the dispute is paradoxically convoluted. Clifford’s lawsuit seeks to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement requiring her to keep secret her sexual relationship with Donald Trump, but the lawsuit itself announces the nature of the relationship in the first paragraph of the suit’s factual background: \n \n Ms. Clifford began an intimate relationship with Mr. Trump in the Summer of 2006 in Lake Tahoe and continued her relationship with Mr. Trump well into the year 2007. \n \n Indeed, the opening of the barn doors surely preceded this lawsuit. Countless news outlets have already reported that Clifford had approached Slate’s Jacob Weisberg in late 2016 with details that match the allegations in the lawsuit. The Wall Street Journal has also reported on the details of a $130,000 payment made by Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to Clifford at the height of the campaign. This payment may have been a violation of federal election law, but the point is that it speaks to how much the public already knows about this supposedly confidential case. \n \n That arrangement had a nondisclosure agreement with a mandatory arbitration clause, of which Cohen availed himself late last month. Again, it’s all very labyrinthine. \n \n Putting aside for the moment the question of whether Clifford’s lawsuit, by its being filed publicly instead of under seal, represents a breach of the nondisclosure agreement, the next most convoluted question involves Clifford’s attorney Michael Avenatti’s central claim that the agreement is invalid. He argues that there can be no confidential settlement to violate because, as he told NBC’s Today: “Mr. Trump did not sign. We believe that that was so that he could later claim deniability, and therefore, from a legal perspective, we believe she’s free to talk.” \n \n Sure enough, Trump’s seismograph-like signature does not appear on the agreement, either as himself or by his latest alleged nom de plume, “David Dennison.” But if Clifford deposited the check, the court might view that act as a unilateral ratification of her end of the agreement. If a court interprets the parties’ conduct as evincing the existence of a contract, it wouldn’t then matter whether either party signed. \n \n Whether Clifford’s attorney is right involves an area of contract law most lawyers last encountered on their first-year exam, known as the “statute of frauds.” Each state has its own such statute and they’re largely similar, but essentially it requires that certain types of contracts must be signed in writing by both parties. It’s well-established that a court can find a contract valid even where neither party signs simply by the conduct of the parties, though this rule is somewhat constrained in contracts governed by the statue of frauds. If a court deems this agreement as falling outside the statue of frauds, then Trump’s lack of signature might not matter. Generally, the types of contracts that require signatures are weighty and have lasting implications—real estate contracts, mortgages, long-term employment contracts, surety agreements, debts dischargeable in bankruptcy, and so on. \n \n That a lawsuit seeking to undo the terms of an agreement could potentially violate that agreement suggests that we’re inside a farcical adaptation of the film Inception. \n \n So the question for the court might be whether the Trump–Clifford nondisclosure agreement categorically squares with California’s enumerated statute of frauds. While the aforementioned types don’t quite fit, one interesting candidate is California Civ. Code 1624(a)(1), which requires a signature of the party to be charged or the party’s agent where the agreement, “by its terms is not to be performed within a year from the making” of the agreement. So the question is: What would that mean, with respect to this nondisclosure agreement, where Clifford is obligated to remain silent indefinitely, a period that could easily extend past a year? Despite that argument’s intuitive appeal, courts have mostly viewed indefinite duration contracts as not falling within this one-year provision, sometimes reasoning that the party could die within a year, sometimes finding validation where only one of the parties completes performance. Often, one party’s ratification (e.g., cashing the check) can serve as an exception to the statute of frauds. \n \n Whatever the merits of Clifford’s argument that Trump’s failure to sign the agreement rendered it invalid, it may not ultimately matter because in order for Trump to prevail on the agreement he would have to take Clifford to court and enforce it. For a president of the United States to sue an ex–porn actress for revealing details of their extramarital affair allegedly occurring shortly after the birth of his son Barron would seem to be a politically fraught venture, even for a president as Teflon as Trump has proven to be. \n \n One big caveat to consider here is that Cohen has already filed an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the agreement, with the lawsuit alleging that it was filed “surreptitiously” and without notice to Clifford, and that its purpose was to silence Clifford. The California court could perhaps tell Clifford that she needs to take her case to the same arbitration panel. Clifford’s response to that suggestion is implicit in her lawsuit—arguing that there is no agreement because Trump didn’t sign it. Accordingly, if there’s no agreement, the arbitration clause within can be disregarded. \n \n The stakes are daunting enough for Clifford, at least on paper—the agreement contains a $1 million liquidated damages clause for each individual breach of the agreement, and it’s reasonable to assume that she doesn’t presently have $1 million in the bank. Whether or not filing such a lawsuit publicly might separately constitute such a breach, or multiple such breaches, is a rabbit hole beyond the scope of the rabbit hole we’ve already crawled down. That a lawsuit seeking to undo the terms of an agreement could potentially violate that agreement suggests that we’re inside a farcical adaptation of the film Inception. \n \n At every stage of this story, the White House has simply pretended that Stephanie Clifford doesn’t exist. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that Trump had been unaware of the payment and that he denied the relationship took place, another point of contention of the lawsuit itself—the suit argues that it stretches credulity to argue Trump didn’t know about the payment—and one that would seem potentially to offer another avenue for invalidating it. If Trump was not even aware of the agreement, how could he agree to it and how could Cohen even have acted as an agent on his behalf in signing? Then again, what Trump supposedly paying $130,000 for was the right to pretend none of this ever happened. Harvey Weinstein can probably sympathize. \n \n Ultimately, if Trump chooses to enforce the agreement against Clifford in court it will serve as a tacit admission of Clifford’s underlying story. However, if a court throws out the suit and the enforcement is made in arbitration, then we may never get the full story. Perhaps the lesson here is that nondisclosure agreements over personally embarrassing incidents involving the rich and famous aren’t particularly useful as anything more than a calculated bluff, when the revelations can’t be undone by 1 million uncollectable dollars.', 'Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Sarah Fitzpatrick \n \n President Donald Trump\'s lawyer is trying to silence adult-film star Stormy Daniels, obtaining a secret restraining order in a private arbitration proceeding and warning that she will face penalties if she publicly discusses a relationship with the president, NBC News has learned. \n \n The new pressure on Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, comes a day after she filed a lawsuit in a Los Angeles court alleging that a nondisclosure agreement she made to keep quiet about an ""intimate"" relationship with Trump is invalid because he never signed it. \n \n Tuesday\'s lawsuit says that Trump attorney Michael Cohen — who brokered the agreement with Clifford during the presidential campaign — attempted to ""intimidate"" Clifford and ""shut her up"" by initiating what it calls a ""bogus arbitration proceeding"" against her in Los Angeles on Feb. 27. \n \n On that day, Cohen obtained a temporary restraining order against Clifford from the private arbitrator, a retired judge, which bars her from disclosing ""confidential information"" related to the nondisclosure agreement signed in October 2016, according to a copy of the order obtained by NBC News. \n \n Read the temporary restraining order against Stormy Daniels \n \n On Feb. 28, Cohen emailed the restraining order to Clifford\'s former attorney, Keith Davidson. ""The document itself is to remain confidential and not to be disclosed to anyone as per the terms of the judge\'s order,"" the email, obtained by NBC News, said. \n \n Reached for comment late Wednesday afternoon, Clifford\'s current attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Cohen, through his own attorney, Lawrence Rosen, has made further attempts to enforce the order and caution Clifford that she is subject to damages if she talks about Trump. \n \n ""Earlier today, Mr. Cohen through his attorney, Mr. Rosen, further threatened my client in an effort to prevent her from telling the truth about what really happened,"" Avenatti said. ""We do not take kindly to these threats, nor we will be intimidated."" \n \n Cohen and Rosen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from NBC News. \n \n But Rosen, who has represented Trump and his companies in the past, said in a statement to other media outlets that the agreement with Clifford contained an arbitration clause with permission to ""seek an injunction in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the agreement."" \n \n “The designated judge from the arbitration tribunal found that Ms. Clifford had violated the agreement and enjoined her from, among other things, filing this lawsuit,"" Rosen said in the statement. \n \n White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a press briefing Wednesday that Trump denies ""all of these allegations"" — that he had an affair with Clifford more than a decade ago or that he knew Cohen had paid her $130,000. \n \n ""I have had conversations with the president about this and as I outlined earlier, this case had already been won in arbitration,"" Sanders said. It\'s unclear what Sanders was referring to; Trump is not listed as a party on the restraining order issued by the arbitration judge. \n \n Asked about that comment, Avenatti quipped, ""Yeah, and he won the popular vote, too."" \n \n Analysis: Stormy Daniels isn\'t suing Donald Trump for cash \n \n “President Trump hasn’t won anything relating to Ms. Clifford,"" he added. \n \n ""First of all, it does not appear as if he was even a party to the arbitration Ms. Sanders is referring to. How can you win something you’re not even a part of? Secondly, claiming that Mr. Trump ‘won’ at arbitration when there has been no hearing, no notice to Ms. Clifford, no opportunity given to her to respond, and no decision on the merits, is completely bogus."" \n \n Earlier on Wednesday, Avenatti told ""Today"" that Clifford\'s lawsuit, if successful, would allow his client to ""tell her story."" \n \n ""She believes it\'s important that the public learn the truth about what happened,"" he said. ""I think it\'s time for her to tell her story and for the public to decide who is telling the truth."" \n \n The suit asks a California court to affirm that the agreement Clifford signed is invalid. \n \n The ""hush agreement,"" as it\'s called in the suit, refers to Clifford as Peggy Peterson and another individual as David Dennison. In one of the documents, the true identity of Dennison is blacked out, but Avenatti said the individual is Trump. \n \n Clifford signed both the agreement and a side letter agreement using her professional name on Oct. 28, 2016, just days before the 2016 presidential election. Cohen signed the document the same day. Both agreements were appended to the lawsuit as Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2. \n \n Each document includes a blank where ""DD"" is supposed to sign, but neither blank is signed. \n \n Clifford and Trump had an intimate relationship that lasted from the summer of 2006 ""well into the year 2007,"" and meetings in Lake Tahoe and at the Beverly Hills Hotel, the lawsuit alleges. In the past, Cohen has said the president denies there was ever a relationship. \n \n The lawsuit says that Cohen — who says he used his personal funds to facilitate a payment to Clifford — has been trying to scare the actress into not talking. \n \n ""To be clear, the attempts to intimidate Ms. Clifford into silence and \'shut her up\' in order to \'protect Mr. Trump\' continue unabated,"" says the suit. ""On or about February 27, 2018, Mr. Trump\'s attorney Mr. Cohen surreptitiously initiated a bogus arbitration proceeding against Ms. Clifford in Los Angeles."" \n \n The nondisclosure agreement said any further dispute would be resolved by binding arbitration ""to the greatest extent permitted by law."" \n \n If the agreement is void because Trump didn\'t sign it, as Clifford argues, the arbitration clause would also be unenforceable.']",5,"– President Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, got a restraining order against Stormy Daniels last month in an attempt to keep the adult film star from speaking out about her alleged 2006 affair with Trump, the New York Times reports. The temporary Feb. 27 order, obtained in a private arbitration meeting with a retired judge, prohibits Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) from discussing ""confidential information"" related to the nondisclosure agreement she signed in Oct. 2016, NBC News reports. Daniels' lawyer tells NBC that Cohen has continued to make efforts to silence Daniels via ""threats"" and ""intimidation"" since the order was procured, warning her she is subject to damages should she talk. In her lawsuit against Trump attempting to have the NDA declared invalid, filed Tuesday, Daniels refers to a ""bogus,"" ""improper and procedurally defective arbitration proceeding hidden from public view,"" the AP reports. Cohen's own attorney says the NDA Daniels signed included an arbitration clause with permission to ""seek an injunction in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the agreement,"" and that ""the designated judge from the arbitration tribunal found that Ms. Clifford had violated the agreement and enjoined her from, among other things, filing [her lawsuit against Trump]."" Also Wednesday, White House rep Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump denies ""all of these allegations""—both the affair and any knowledge of Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels—and that ""this case [has] already been won in arbitration."" Her exact meaning was not clear, as Trump is not listed as a party on the restraining order, and CNN's Chris Cillizza notes several of Sanders' ""non-answers"" skirt the issue of whether Trump knew about the hush money. If all of this seems a lot to wrap your head around, you're not alone; Slate calls it ""convoluted to the point of paradox."""
"['Of the 12 arrested on Saturday, seven were booked at the Anaheim Detention Facility, according to a statement released by Anaheim Police. \n \n Three people were stabbed, one with a flagpole, and 12 people were arrested during a brawl on Saturday morning between self-described Ku Klux Klan members and counter-protesters at an Anaheim park, police said. \n \n Initially arrested were five Klan members – four men and a woman – and seven counter-protesters – five men, a male juvenile and a woman. Seven people were booked in the Anaheim jail on assault or abuse charges. Police are seeking one additional suspect who can be seen in a video of the altercation punching a Klansman. \n \n “I’ve lived in Anaheim my whole life and I have never heard of anything like this,” said Anaheim resident Joe Castaneda, who saw the melee break out. \n \n The confrontation occurred at around noon after a group of six KKK members showed up at Pearson Park, a witness said. Klan leaders earlier this week announced their intention to hold a rally there, and a group of about 30 counter-protesters were waiting for them. \n \n One of the counter-protesters was stabbed with the decorative end of a flagpole, said Anaheim police Sgt. Daron Wyatt. An officer responding to the scene saw one of the Klansmen stab a counter-protester with a knife. The Klansman admitted to stabbing the man, but told the officers that it was self-defense, Wyatt said. \n \n The counter-protesters and the Klansmen briefly had words before the fight began, Castaneda said. \n \n He said the counter-protesters were telling the Klansmen that they weren’t welcome in the community and to get out. He couldn’t hear what the Klansmen were saying. \n \n “Some words were exchanged and that is pretty much when the fight began,” Castaneda said. \n \n The Klansmen were badly outnumbered, Castaneda said, forcing most of them to get back into a black SUV and try to flee. They left three Klansmen behind. \n \n “It was just the three of them against a whole crowd,” Castaneda said. \n \n At one point, Castaneda said, one of the Klansmen lunged at him with the flagpole, but backed away after Castaneda stepped back and showed the man a cane he uses to walk. \n \n The men were wearing military type clothing, Castaneda said. “They were definitely dressed up (for) the occasion.” \n \n The man stabbed by the flag pole was taken to a hospital in critical condition, Wyatt said, but his condition later improved. The second stabbing victim suffered lesser injuries. The extent of injuries for the third victim, found in a vehicle on Lemon Street, was not clear. All victims are expected to survive. \n \n Warning: The following video contains graphic footage. \n \n Anaheim police on Friday sent a Twitter message out telling the community that they were aware of the planned KKK rally. The message noted that several other rallies have occurred over the past few years, with a small group of Klansman passing out “literature” and holding signs. \n \n Counter-protesters had been at the park since early Saturday morning awaiting the rally, according to a witness who had been there since 9 a.m. \n \n “You could feel the pulsing energy. I know that people were watching the street to see when the Klansmen would show up,” said Melodye Shore of Laguna Niguel, who was observing the protest with a friend. “As soon as they saw that van, they were just all over it.” \n \n She said police response was not immediate. \n \n “I would think that they would be a physical presence, considering that they did know that there was a planned activity,” she said. “They should have been right there. But no, it took awhile. I had time to take a bunch of pictures before the police showed up.” \n \n Anaheim Police said in a news release they had a contingent of officers dedicated to the event. “Those officers were on scene immediately as the violence erupted and called for additional personnel,” according to the statement. \n \n On Saturday, most of the protesters were gone by mid-afternoon, with a group of about two-dozen park visitors remaining to watch police go over the portion of Cypress Street where the conflict occurred. \n \n The Klan once had a strong presence in Anaheim, and at the Pearson Park site. \n \n On April 14, 1924, Anaheim voters elected four of five City Council members who secretly belonged to the Klan. \n \n Many city workers resigned, but nine of Anaheim\'s 10 police officers supported the Klan – which held parades, painted the streets with K.I.G.Y. for “Klansmen I Greet You,” and stationed gunmen on buildings to shoot anyone dousing their burning crosses. \n \n In August 1924, the Klan staged its largest rally ever in the state, drawing 10,000 people to what is now called Pearson Park. Within a year, however, on Feb. 3, 1925, more than 95 percent of the voters turned out to recall the Klansmen and reclaim their town. \n \n Wyatt said police are seeking video footage of the melee. \n \n ""We know there were all kinds of people out here with video, and we need that,"" he said. \n \n He asked witnesses to call Orange County Crime Stoppers at 855-847-6227. \n \n Staff writer Samuel Mountjoy contributed to this report.', 'A Ku Klux Klansman, left, uses an American flag to fend off angry counter protesters after members of the KKK tried to start a ""White Lives Matter"" rally at Pearson Park in Anaheim, Calif., on Saturday,...

A spokesman with the Anaheim Police Department says six of those arrested are Klan supporters and seven counter-protesters. All three people who were stabbed are believed to be counter-protesters. One person is in critical condition and one was stabbed in the upper torso by the tip of a flagpole, the Orange County Register reports. A man wearing a ""Grand Dragon"" shirt was seen kicked by protesters, the LA Times reports, and Brian Levin, director of CSU San Bernardino's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, says he pushed a Klan leader away during the violence. ""How do you feel that a Jewish guy just saved your life?"" Levin says he asked him. According to Levin, the man replied, ""Thank you."" The KKK's history in Anaheim goes way back: The hate group held four out of five seats on the City Council before being ousted during a recall effort in 1924. Almost 300 Klansmen once lived in the city, where they patrolled with masks and robes and once held a rally that drew 20,000. But recent activities have been ""sporadic,"" says the Times, which notes two incidents of KKK fliers distributed last year."
"['T \n \n he most likely person to replace retiring Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), at least according to early political prognostications, is Rep. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a black conservative first elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010. DeMint reportedly favors Scott to replace him, other conservatives love him, and he appears to have a good relationship with the only person who matters, Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.). (Haley will handpick a senator who will serve until an election is held in 2014.) But almost as soon as Scott\'s name popped up, another South Carolina native was roped in: Stephen Colbert. \n \n The ubiquitous mock Twitter feed, @ColbertforSC, appeared almost immediately after DeMint shocked Capitol Hill with the announcement that he\'s jumping ship to head up the Heritage Foundation. But Colbert didn\'t exactly run away from the encouragement. ""Stephen is honored by the groundswell of support from the Palmetto State and looks forward to Governor Haley\'s call,"" says his personal publicist, Carrie Byalick. And on his own (real) Twitter feed, Colbert just fed the speculation: \n \n Tweet @nikkihaley & tell her why I belong in the US Senate. For one, I wouldn\'t just block legislation, I\'d body-check it! #SenatorColbert — Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) December 7, 2012 \n \n Conservatives are throwing cold water on the idea, though perhaps a little defensively. ""Colbert and his supporters are likely destined for disappointment in getting the host appointed to fill DeMint\'s seat,"" says Madeleine Morgenstern at Glenn Beck\'s site The Blaze. ""Haley, a Republican, will make the call and is no doubt familiar with Colbert\'s bombastic, faux-conservative stage personality."" \n \n But it\'s not entirely implausible that Colbert could make a strong run for the seat in the 2014 election. He\'s ""made no secret of his desire to hold higher office,"" having staged mostly satirical runs for the White House in 2008 and 2012, notes Andy Kroll at Mother Jones. Plus, he has a real-life, bona fide super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow, which he transformed into a dark-money nonprofit, Colbert Super-PAC SHH! ""Colbert would have had a tough road in the primaries,"" both Democratic and Republican, says David Graham at The Atlantic. But a Senator Colbert isn\'t impossible, and it would certainly shake up Washington. ""Consider it, Governor Haley."" \n \n Colbert is a comedian, but he does dabble in real politics — he appeared before Congress to testify about campaign finance, and he\'s appeared at a fake rally in South Carolina with real presidential hopeful Herman Cain. And he has up to $900,000 left in super PAC money that would go a long way in a ""run for national office as a senator from the state that calls him its \'favorite son,\'"" says Ross Luippold at The Huffington Post. ""There\'s one problem, though: Colbert can\'t actually serve in the Senate."" His contract with Comedy Central isn\'t up until 2014, after the special election. Oh well, ""we certainly hope he has some fun in the meantime.""', 'Stephen Colbert has launched a Twitter campaign to get South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to appoint him to replace Sen. Jim DeMint, who announced he was quitting Thursday. And the problem is not that Colbert isn\'t qualified. It\'s that he\'s too qualified. \n \n ""Let\'s see, you need someone young, someone conservative, someone from South Carolina, maybe someone who had a super PAC?"" Colbert said on The Colbert Report Thursday night, as his left hand tried to smother his right. Sure. But let\'s be real. What you need to be a senator these days is the ability to ""say words good on the TV."" Colbert says words too good. Instead of displaying talking points-style discipline during interviews, he engages in spontaneous riffing. Worse, Colbert has a skill set that is way to broad for the Senate. He appears to speaks Latin nearly fluently. He studied philosophy in college. His favorite book is not nearly down-to-earth or biblical enough — it\'s Lord of the Rings. He believes that science is real, at least given the number of scientists he books on his show. He told New York magazine in 2007 that he loves Richard Nixon — but not for the appropriate reasons, like that Nixon got really good at winning presidential elections. Instead, Colbert loves Nixon\'s policy: ""He started the EPA. He opened China. He gave 18-year-olds the vote. His issues were education, drugs, women, minorities, youth involvement, ending the draft, and improving the environment. John Kerry couldn’t have run on this! What would I give for a Nixon?"" \n \n Think about the man Colbert would be replacing. Jim DeMint might be quitting to run a think tank, but he\'s no thinker, according to The Washington Post\'s Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger. Rubin writes: \n \n Even DeMint would not claim to be a serious scholar. He is a pol. He’s a pol whose entire style of conservatism – all or nothing, no compromise, no accounting for changes in public habits and opinions — is not true to the tradition of Edmund Burke, Russell Kirk and others... Every individual who works [at Heritage] should take pause and consider whether the reputation of that institution is elevated or diminished by this move. And I would say the same, frankly, if any other non-scholarly pol took that spot. \n \n Colbert is a nerd. We can\'t waste his brains in the Senate. \n \n Looks like it\'s still Tim Scott\'s seat to lose after all. \n \n Want to add to this story?

"['Megan Rapinoe, front, fends off Washington’s Alyssa Kleiner in the second half at Maryland SoccerPlex. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) \n \n U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe never got a chance to kneel during the national anthem Wednesday at Maryland SoccerPlex. \n \n In a preemptive move, the owner of the Washington Spirit, Air Force veteran Bill Lynch, ordered “The Star-Spangled Banner” to be played while the teams were in the locker room. \n \n The Spirit took the action, the National Women’s Soccer League club said, “rather than subject our fans and friends to the disrespect we feel such an act would represent.” \n \n [Rapinoe responds after the game: ‘It’s [expletive] unbelievable. Saddened by it.’] \n \n Typically, the players warm up for an extended period, return to the locker room for final instructions, then take the field for introductions and the anthem. In this case, moments after the Spirit and Seattle Reign players finished warm-ups and retreated indoors, fans were asked to stand and observe the anthem. \n \n Rapinoe first knelt for the anthem Sunday during the Reign’s game at Chicago against the Red Stars, saying she did it as a nod to San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick created a national stir late last month when he refused to stand for the anthem during a preseason game. \n \n [Colin Kaepernick plans to put money from his top-selling jersey to good use] \n \n Players on both teams arrived at the SoccerPlex unaware of plans for the early playing of the anthem. Spirit Coach Jim Gabarra told his players in the locker room just before the anthem started. Rapinoe, who had entered as a substitute in the previous two matches, was not in Seattle’s starting lineup and came on in the second half. \n \n In a match twice delayed by lightning, the first-place Spirit (12-3-3) won, 2-1, to clinch home-field advantage in the league semifinals, Sept. 30 or Oct. 1. Crystal Dunn, Rapinoe’s U.S. Olympic teammate, scored a sensational goal from 22 yards just before halftime and Cheyna Williams put away a rebound in the 61st minute. Kim Little converted a penalty kick in the 71st for the Reign (6-6-6). \n \n [More on the match, plus video of Dunn’s goal] \n \n The Spirit said it did not want Rapinoe to detract from the final regular season home game, which, combined with other results in the league, could’ve clinched first place for Washington with two matches remaining. \n \n “We understand this may be seen as an extraordinary step, but believe it was the best option to avoid taking focus away from the game on such an important night for our franchise,” the Spirit said in a statement. “While we respect every individual’s right to express themselves, and believe Ms. Rapinoe to be an amazing individual with a huge heart; we respectfully disagree with her method of hijacking our organization’s event to draw attention to what is ultimately a personal — albeit worthy — cause.” \n \n Kaepernick’s stance has continued to generate headlines. The NFL.com’s Steve Wyche was the first to notice Kaepernick sitting during the anthem before the 49ers Aug. 27 game against Green Bay. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said afterward. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” \n \n Kaepernick has continued to sit for the anthem since, and Rapinoe is part of a handful of athletes to follow his lead. The Spirit, however, was able to sidestep any controversy with its move Wednesday night. \n \n “As a veteran owned team, the national anthem holds an exceptionally special meaning for this organization,” the team’s statement continued. “Our owner Bill Lynch has lost personal friends during overseas conflicts and has other close friends who have also lost loved ones. Playing the national anthem prior to sports events became standard during World War II and was a way to express the team’s and fan’s patriotism and show support for the U.S. Military. The tradition of honoring our military and our patriotism before our games is very important to us. We strongly feel that there are better ways to begin a conversation about a cause than tarnishing a tradition that is so important to so many.” \n \n “To willingly allow anyone to hijack this tradition that means so much to millions of Americans and so many of our own fans for any cause would effectively be just as disrespectful as doing it ourselves. Professional athletes have incredible numbers of followers, to which we believe they have the ability to articulate a conversation with objectives and plans and begin a serious conversation directly, or through traditional media appearances, without insulting our military and our fans. \n \n “We do regret that this decision has denied the players who had no intention of taking a knee their own opportunity to honor our great country from the field. This is an issue we are communicating to and with them about personally.” \n \n NWSL Commissioner Jeff Plush attended Wednesday’s match and, after the anthem played, said he was unaware of the Spirit’s plans. \n \n “I would have preferred to have had an honest dialogue of what we wanted to do, what their goals were, and then work through it,” he said. “I don’t suggest I have all the answers, but it’s better to talk about it. I’m disappointed.” \n \n On the broader topic, he said: “It’s an emotional issue. I’m trying to be aware of that and respectful of different points of view. It’s a challenging issue and a challenging time. We’ve got some issues we need to work through as a country. … The issue brought forth by Colin and then Megan is a real issue. We need to have serious conversations about it. I don’t know whether it belongs on the playing surface. It’s bigger than us.” \n \n In recent days, Lynch shared his feelings about the anthem controversy with his players, saying he would be disappointed if any of them followed Rapinoe’s lead. He did not threaten to fine or suspend anyone who did kneel. \n \n The Spirit and Reign will meet again Sunday in Seattle. \n \n In a statement released earlier Wednesday, Reign management said: “We will continue to encourage all Reign players to participate in the pre-match ceremony, which honors those who have served and made sacrifices on our behalf. We will also continue to allow players to participate in the pre-match ceremony in a manner consistent with their personal beliefs, reflecting our respect for the rights earned and defended by those fighting for our nation.”', 'Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

I don’t anticipate it having this huge effect [this weekend]. I hope the conversation continues and I hope I still get questions about it — maybe a couple about that and some about the game. The Spirit doesn’t deserve [this], [having advanced to] the playoffs and clinch home-field advantage, and we haven’t talked about them once” during the interview session. \n \n Have you been in contact with the U.S. Soccer Federation and do you plan to kneel at national team games? \n \n “I’ve been in touch with U.S. Soccer, with the media relations there. Just talking through my process and an on-going process daily with my agent, U.S. Soccer and everyone involved. As of now, I do plan [to kneel]. It’s an ever-evolving process. I know it means something a little bit different when I am wearing the U.S. shirt, but I still plan to do it. … I take playing for my country very seriously. It’s a huge honor. I hope we can flush this out and the outrage can die down and we can have a meaningful conversation.” \n \n What is the message you want to get out? \n \n “We need to have an open conversation about race relations in this country and what that means to both sides. The conversation gets so mixed up: What are we actually talking about? We’re talking about Americans that have to deal with oppression and racism and poverty — and the intersection of all of that. Being a woman, we talk about equal pay all the time. We’re not talking about if you’re black or if you are Latina. I would like to get back to that, and improving the relationship between the police community and the community of color. I don’t know exactly all the right things to say, but I want to engage in that conversation. In part, I went into this knowing I don’t have all of the answers. I’ve opened myself up and been a little bit exposed because I don’t know everything. And there is no way I can. But I want to. I think there are a lot of people out there who want to and don’t know how. That’s a difficult thing if you live in a predominantly white community and don’t have a lot experience in that, but this can help open up the conversation a little bit more.” \n \n Reign Coach Laura Harvey also addressed the issue. \n \n Did it cause a distraction? \n \n “I don’t think it impacted the game. We were told just before we left the locker room that the anthem had already been played. I let Megan know that. We had a very brief reaction to that. We were trying to be very focused on what we were trying to do. I just felt there was a strange atmosphere at the start of the game because most people thought it would’ve been played and we are walking out not really knowing why.” \n \n Are you disappointed how the anthem issue was handled? \n \n “Disappointed in the sense that we’ve tried to do everything we can to prepare for every eventuality leading up to today. To not be notified prior is disappointing.” \n \n The Spirit owner said he didn’t want Megan hijacking the event, but now the anthem is the topic of discussion after the game. \n \n “The last thing we’re speaking about is the game. It wouldn’t have been that if the anthem had been played and it wouldn’t have been that if stuff hadn’t been out public. That in itself shows that maybe the decision had an adverse effect.” \n \n Through a team spokeswoman, Spirit players said they did not want to discuss the anthem issue. \n \n NWSL Commissioner Jeff Plush attended the match and said he did not know the Spirit had planned to play the anthem while the teams were inside. He answered a few questions while watching the first half. \n \n “I was on a phone call inside and heard the music, so I rushed out to see if the players were out there.” \n \n Reaction? \n \n “It’s an emotional issue. I’m trying to be aware of that and respectful of different points of view. It’s a challenging issue and a challenging time. We’ve got some issues we need to work through as a country.

I don’t suggest I have all the answers, but it’s better to talk about it. I’m disappointed.” \n \n Will the league sanction the organization in some way? \n \n “I haven’t thought about that piece of it yet. It is secondary. What’s important right here is a playoff-implication match. But the issue brought forth by Colin and then Megan is a real issue. We need to have serious conversations about it. I don’t know whether it belongs on the playing surface. It’s bigger than us.” \n \n Did you approach Spirit owner Bill Lynch before kickoff? \n \n “I haven’t talked to Bill yet.

Being a woman, we talk about equal pay all the time. We’re not talking about if you’re black or if you are Latina. I would like to get back to that, and improving the relationship between the police community and the community of color. I don’t know exactly all the right things to say, but I want to engage in that conversation. In part, I went into this knowing I don’t have all of the answers. I’ve opened myself up and been a little bit exposed because I don’t know everything. And there is no way I can. But I want to. I think there are a lot of people out there who want to and don’t know how. That’s a difficult thing if you live in a predominantly white community and don’t have a lot experience in that, but this can help open up the conversation a little bit more.” \n \n Reign Coach Laura Harvey also addressed the issue. \n \n Did it cause a distraction? \n \n “I don’t think it impacted the game. We were told just before we left the locker room that the anthem had already been played. I let Megan know that. We had a very brief reaction to that. We were trying to be very focused on what we were trying to do. I just felt there was a strange atmosphere at the start of the game because most people thought it would’ve been played and we are walking out not really knowing why.” \n \n Are you disappointed how the anthem issue was handled? \n \n “Disappointed in the sense that we’ve tried to do everything we can to prepare for every eventuality leading up to today. To not be notified prior is disappointing.” \n \n The Spirit owner said he didn’t want Megan hijacking the event, but now the anthem is the topic of discussion after the game. \n \n “The last thing we’re speaking about is the game. It wouldn’t have been that if the anthem had been played and it wouldn’t have been that if stuff hadn’t been out public. That in itself shows that maybe the decision had an adverse effect.” \n \n Through a team spokeswoman, Spirit players said they did not want to discuss the anthem issue. \n \n NWSL Commissioner Jeff Plush attended the match and said he did not know the Spirit had planned to play the anthem while the teams were inside. He answered a few questions while watching the first half. \n \n “I was on a phone call inside and heard the music, so I rushed out to see if the players were out there.” \n \n Reaction? \n \n “It’s an emotional issue. I’m trying to be aware of that and respectful of different points of view. It’s a challenging issue and a challenging time. We’ve got some issues we need to work through as a country. I don’t know how to do it.” \n \n Violation of league protocol? \n \n “I would have preferred to have had an honest dialogue of what we wanted to do, what their goals were, and then work through it. I don’t suggest I have all the answers, but it’s better to talk about it. I’m disappointed.” \n \n Will the league sanction the organization in some way? \n \n “I haven’t thought about that piece of it yet. It is secondary. What’s important right here is a playoff-implication match. But the issue brought forth by Colin and then Megan is a real issue. We need to have serious conversations about it. I don’t know whether it belongs on the playing surface. It’s bigger than us.” \n \n Did you approach Spirit owner Bill Lynch before kickoff? \n \n “I haven’t talked to Bill yet. I wanted to take a deep breath. I saw their press release. I get it. I’m trying to be respectful to two really opposite points of view.”']",5,"– If Megan Rapinoe had planned to take a knee during the national anthem in her Wednesday night game against the Washington Spirit, the owner of that women's soccer team effectively squelched that plan. Per the Washington Post, Spirit owner Bill Lynch, an Air Force veteran, made sure the anthem was played at Maryland SoccerPlex only after his team and Rapinoe's Seattle Reign FC headed to the locker room after warmups, a preemptive strike against Rapinoe's anticipated repeat of her protest at a Sunday night game (a show of support for the 49ers' QB Colin Kaepernick). ""We understand this may be seen as an extraordinary step, but believe it was the best option to avoid taking focus away from the game on such an important night for our franchise,"" the Spirit said in a statement, referencing its last regular-season home game that could help earn it a first-place slot. The statement went on to say that although Rapinoe is ""an amazing individual with a huge heart,"" the Spirit didn't want her ""hijacking"" the game for her ""personal—albeit worthy—cause,"" nor to ""subject our fans and friends to the disrespect we feel such an act would represent."" Rapinoe, for her part, said after the game she was ""saddened"" by the song subterfuge and called it ""f---ing unbelievable"" and ""incredibly distasteful, four days before [the anniversary of] one of the worst tragedies in our country, to say I tried to hijack this event."" One other person not aware in advance of the Spirit's plans, per the Post: National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Jeff Plush, who says he was ""disappointed"" by Lynch's move. Meanwhile, Rapinoe's team issued its own statement that said it will ""continue to encourage"" its players to take part in any pre-game ceremonies, but that they're free to do so ""in a manner consistent with their personal beliefs.""

"['Katharine Brown was one of David O. Selznick’s most trusted employees. Her job—and it was a 24-hour-a-day one—was to scour New York’s publishing circles and sniff out unproduced properties that her hard-driving boss could spin into box-office gold. As the mercurial, 34-year-old movie mogul’s official East Coast story editor and unofficial gal Friday/arbiter of good taste, Brown needed to have lightning-quick instincts and the thick hide of an elephant. After all, Selznick was notoriously demanding and infamous for his short-fused three a.m. phone calls. It wasn’t easy keeping pace with a mind that whirred as feverishly as Selznick’s. But Brown was one of the few movie executives who could keep up. \n \n On the afternoon of May 20, 1936, she fired off an urgent Teletype to her employer. The message read: “ . . . have just airmailed detailed synopsis of Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, also a copy of the book . . . This is an absolutely magnificent story . . . a great literary property and we must have it . . . The book is 1,000 pages long and I have only gotten through half of it, it is one of the most lush things I have ever read . . . I am absolutely off my nut about this book . . . I beg, urge, coax and plead with you to read it at once . . . I know that after you do you will drop everything and buy it.” \n \n In fact, Selznick did not drop everything after reading Gone with the Wind. He didn’t even crack its imposing spine. Instead, he relied on the 150-page synopsis that Brown had given him, poring over it while on vacation in Honolulu. Selznick knew that the success of adapting Mitchell’s novel would depend on casting. Even though he was a compulsive gambler who lived to place exorbitantly large bets—whether in the boardroom or at the horse track—he balked at the book’s rich $50,000 price tag. But like all gamblers, he lived in a constant state of fear that someone else might rake in a pot that he felt rightfully belonged to him. He wasn’t sure he wanted Gone with the Wind, but he was certain that he didn’t want anyone else to have it. \n \n So after several weeks of hemming and hawing, on July 6, 1936, Selznick finally relented to Brown’s impassioned pleas, opened his checkbook and paid a king’s ransom for the movie rights. It would be the easiest decision and the most incident-free moment of the next three years.', 'ATLANTA (AP) — Seventy-five years after the premiere of the movie ""Gone with the Wind,"" research is shedding light on the racial tensions that existed at the time between the producer and city of Atlanta officials. \n \n In this image released by Turner Classic Movies, Clark Gable, left, appears in character as Rhett Butler and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O\'Hara, in the film ""Gone with the Wind."" 75 years after the premiere...

(Associated Press) \n \n Emory University film studies professor Matthew Bernstein has conducted extensive research into the archives of the film\'s producer, David O. Selznick. His findings illustrate some of Selznick\'s concerns with the city\'s treatment of the film\'s black stars at the Dec. 15, 1939 premiere. \n \n ""Producer David O. Selznick was upset that Hattie McDaniel would not be invited to the Atlanta premiere,"" said Bernstein. ""He argued over and over that she should be allowed."" \n \n McDaniel played the character, Mammy, and went on to become the first black actor to receive an Academy Award for her performance as Best Supporting Actress in 1940. \n \n Selznick was guided by the office of Atlanta\'s then-mayor William B. Hartsfield. It was Hartsfield that originally reached out to Selznick to bring the premiere to the city. \n \n But due to the racial segregation laws in the Jim Crow south, none of the movie\'s black stars were allowed to attend the premiere or even be included in the movie\'s promotional program. McDaniel did attend the Los Angeles premiere and was featured in the program. \n \n ""Selznick, because he was Jewish, was very mindful of the persecution of the Jews in Europe in the late-1930s under Nazism,"" Bernstein remarks. ""And he saw an analogy between that persecution and the life of African-Americans under Jim Crow, especially in the South."" \n \n Bernstein spent years poring over the Harry Ransom Center\'s Selznick archive at the University of Texas, Austin. Among the items studied, memos and telegrams exchanged with Selznick\'s staff document the extent of his efforts to persuade Atlanta officials to change their minds. \n \n However, Katharine Brown, Selznick\'s east coast assistant and story editor, concedes in a Dec. 8, 1939 letter to Selznick that efforts to include the black cast must end. \n \n ""I hope this will not prove to be a dissatisfaction to you but with everyone so touchy, I am trying very hard to use my very best judgment not to create situations,"" Brown writes. \n \n In contrast to the city\'s treatment of the movie\'s black cast, local black organizations performed at various events leading up to the night of the premiere. \n \n ""One of the most fascinating things about the festivities is Martin Luther King Jr., when he was 10 years old, actually appeared on stage at a charity ball dressed as a slave in front of a mock-up of Tara singing with the Ebenezer Baptist Church choir,"" Bernstein points out. \n \n Steve Klein, a spokesman for The King Center, confirmed the event as a reflection of the times but offered a poignant analogy for the civil- and human-rights icon. ""It\'s kind of neat that he could go on and be awarded the Nobel Prize.""', 'Audiences still frankly give a damn about the lavish Civil War epic ""Gone With the Wind"" 75 years after its release. \n \n When adjusted for inflation, the Oscar-winning romance remains the domestic box-office champ with a gross of $1.6 billion. The 220-minute Technicolor film received a record 13 Oscar nominations, winning eight competitive Academy Awards, including best film, actress (Vivien Leigh), supporting actress (Hattie McDaniel) and director (Victor Fleming). With a production cost estimated between $3.85 million and more than $4 million, it was the longest and most expensive Hollywood sound film of the time. \n \n More than 30 million copies of Margaret Mitchell\'s 1936 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, on which the film was based, have been sold. The film has been re-released eight times, been a staple on television since the 1970s and a bestseller on video, DVD and now Blu-ray. \n \n Celebrations of the film\'s diamond anniversary include an exhaustive exhibit at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin, a new collector\'s edition Blu-Ray and several books including Life\'s ""Gone With the Wind: The Great American Movie 75 Years Later."" \n \n Despite criticism and controversy over the film\'s racial stereotypes — the slaves in the film are happy, and McDaniel\'s Mammy is a welcome member of the family and loyal servant — ""Gone With the Wind"" continues to have a special, if troubling, place in the hearts of American filmgoers. \n \n The film was and I think continues to be a pop cultural phenomenon. — USC Professor Richard Jewell \n \n ""The film was and I think continues to be a pop cultural phenomenon,"" said Richard Jewell, professor at USC\'s School of Cinematic Art. ""It\'s one of the few movies that lived up to the book."" \n \n Long before social media, the buzz surrounding the film version of ""GWTW"" was astonishing. After independent producer David O. Selznick brought the rights to the book, ""GWTW"" fans waited on every story coming out of Hollywood about the production, particularly about who would play the willful and beautiful Scarlett O\'Hara, the belle of the Tara plantation. \n \n Though such stars as Joan Crawford, Carole Lombard and Katharine Hepburn were among those considered to play Scarlett — about 1,400 actresses were interviewed — Selznick chose British actress Vivien Leigh, who had made a few films, to play the lead role. \n \n Fan favorite Clark Gable was selected to play Rhett Butler, the rakish Charlestonian who pursues her, and British actor Leslie Howard was cast as Scarlett\'s obsession, the glum Ashley Wilkes. Olivia de Havilland, best known for ingenue roles opposite Errol Flynn, landed the plum role as Wilkes\' sweet cousin and wife, Melanie, and McDaniel was chosen to play the O\'Haras\' beloved and opinionated Mammy. \n \n Jewell noted the film was brilliantly cast. ""Clark Gable was absolutely the right person to play Rhett Butler. Every actress in Hollywood wanted to play Scarlett. The fact that they went with a relatively unknown and she turned out to be the incarnation of Scarlett. It\'s like a baseball team when one day every one gets a hit. \n \n ""It\'s a testament to the old studio system where producers were the most important factor in most cases. Selznick kept that film together. It was Selznick\'s vision more than Victor Fleming\'s. To me he is one of the greatest producers of all time."" \n \n But as Missy Schwartz, editor of the Life ""GWTW"" book and a senior editor at Entertainment Weekly, pointed out, ""you can\'t watch it without 21st century eyes. You have to address race. It\'s problematic, there is no question. It is just not the reality [of slavery]."" \n \n The conversation about ""GWTW\'s"" treatment of slavery, race and a benign antebellum South was particularly heated over the last year with the release of 2013 best picture Oscar winner ""12 Years a Slave,"" which depicted the brutality of slavery. \n \n Todd Boyd, professor of critical studies at USC\'s School of Cinematic Arts, told The Times this year that ""the entirety of the history of African Americans in Hollywood has been problematic, and I think in some ways still is. A lot of people looked at those movies as sort of an authentic representation of what African Americans were like."" \n \n Jim Crow laws were in full force in the South 75 years ago. McDaniel and the other black cast members couldn\'t attend the premiere in Atlanta on Dec. 15, 1939. Gable had threatened to boycott the premiere but was persuaded by McDaniel to attend. The Life book reveals that during production, Gable had also protested when he learned there were segregated toilets on one of the sets, promising not to return if they were still there the next day. They weren\'t. \n \n African Americans protested the film when it opened in major cities. Black playwright Carlton Moss stated in the Daily Worker found Mammy\'s love for the white family ""that has helped to keep her people enchained forever"" particularly reprehensible. \n \n Jewell noted that a lot of films from the Golden Age of Hollywood make one ""uncomfortable"" because of depictions of race and other issues. ""But they need to be screened and talked about, as a way to measure the kind of attitudes that existed at that point, which was 75 years after the end of the Civil War. These kind of stereotypical depictions of black people need to be put in a historical context so people will have a better appreciation of how far we have come."" \n \n TCM host and film historian Robert Osborne believes ""GWTW"" has endured because of its emotional resonance. \n \n ""It\'s about survival,"" he said. ""It hit the world in the \'30s when Europe was going to war and just before we went into the war. Also, everybody has had somebody in their life that they loved more than they loved them back. \n \n ""I think the brilliant thing about the story is that there are little samplings of every part of us in it. It doesn\'t matter if it was set during the Civil War. It\'s a relevant movie about emotions."" \n \n ------------ \n \n Here are events, books and collector\'s items linked to the 75th anniversary of ""Gone With the Wind."" \n \n ""The Making of Gone with the Wind: The exhibition at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin, features about 300 rare items culled from the center\'s David O. Selznick Collection, including the recently restored ""green"" dress worn by Scarlett O\'Hara and other gowns designed by Walter Plunkett.

In Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nashawaty tells the story of the film's making, which centered on producer David Selznick. He was at first reluctant to make the film, despite a glowing review of the book by one of his employees. ""I am absolutely off my nut about this book,"" Katharine Brown wrote, finally convincing him to take action. But plenty got in the way. Among the challenges: The first writer dropped out after spending months on the script. After a number of other writers tried their hand, including Selznick himself, writer Ben Hecht took it on, but there was no time for him to read Margaret Mitchell's book. So Selznick and director Victor Fleming ""stayed up all night acting out the story for him."" Clark Gable was under contract to Selznick's father-in-law, who finally ""loaned"" him to Selznick, with plenty of strings attached—and Gable wasn't thrilled about it. Original director George Cukor didn't get along with Gable and was eventually replaced by Fleming, who didn't get along with Vivien Leigh. ""Leigh hated Fleming. With a passion. Fleming hated her. Clark Gable hated David … Everybody hated David,"" an assistant said. Fleming quit before returning. Ultimately, the film required ""125 days of photography, 37 months of preparation, half a million feet of film and a budget of $4.25 million (at a time when the average feature cost less than $1 million),"" Nashawaty writes. And the trouble was far from over: Racism plagued the various premieres, with black cast members in many cases banned from attending, the Los Angeles Times reports. That prompted anger from Selznick, the AP reports; Gable, meanwhile, had already stood against segregated toilets on set, threatening to bail on the film, according to a Life magazine book cited by the Times. Ultimately, however, ""Selznick kept that film together,"" says a film scholar, and it still holds the record for domestic box-office gross, adjusted for inflation, the Times notes (and you can bet it's a lot better than the current crop of big-grossing films)."
"['While you can copyright scripts, novels, song lyrics, and many other ways of using the English language, you can’t actually copyright the English language. But what about a language that you construct out of whole cloth? Once you share it with the world, are people free to use that new language however they wish, or do you maintain control over its use? \n \n This is one of the questions at the heart of an ongoing legal battle between the creators of a Kickstarter-funded Star Trek fan film and Paramount Pictures, which says the project violates various Trek-related copyrights, including the studio’s copyright claim to the Klingon language. \n \n In Paramount’s original complaint [PDF] against the filmmakers, the studio listed a number of exclusive rights it contends it holds with regard to the Star Trek universe — “characters, themes, plots, dialogue, settings, sequences, situations, and incidents therein, and also the props, character makeup, costumes, sets, fictional language, events, and fictional history.” \n \n Klingon, as you’re likely aware, is a fictional language originally created for use in the Star Trek films and TV shows, but which is now also spoken by fans around the world, both in and outside of the context of Star Trek. \n \n Nowhere in its 1,288 compendium does the U.S. Copyright Office specifically deal with the copyrightability of constructed or fictional languages, let alone Klingon, but in filing their motion to dismiss the complaint [PDF], the filmmakers argue that, among other things, Paramount can not hold the copyright to Klingon. \n \n “The Klingon language itself is an idea or a system, and is not copyrightable,” reads that filing. “As the Supreme Court held in the context of a system of bookkeeping, although copyright protects the author’s expression of the system, it does not prevent others from using the system.” \n \n This week, Paramount fired back, arguing in its response [PDF] that the filmmakers’ claim is this argument is “absurd, since a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no Klingons with whom to communicate.” \n \n The studio says that the filmmakers’ use of the Klingon language in their movie, which has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from supporters, is “simply further evidence of their infringement of Plaintiffs’ characters, since speaking this fictitious language is an aspect of their characters.” \n \n So who is in the right on this one? As we noted above, the U.S. Copyright Office hasn’t specifically addressed the issue, and there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of case law with regard to the exact topic of copyrighting a fictional language. \n \n However, in 2014, the Harvard Journal of Law & Technology published a note [PDF] — originally written for a class by Harvard Law grad Michael Adelman — attempting to answer this very question. \n \n Adelman acknowledges that authors may be tempted to assert a copyright claim over the use of a fictional or constructed language “to prolong her control of the language’s dissemination and development,” but concludes that this sort of copyright claim is “both misguided and likely to fail.” \n \n In fact, Adelman’s note specifically cites the ways in which Paramount has previously established its authority over the use of Klingon. \n \n While linguist Marc Okrand is the creator of the Klingon language and author of subsequent official dictionaries and books about the language, Paramount remains the copyright holder on those titles. Paramount is also the copyright holder of a Klingon translation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet produced by volunteers from the Klingon Language Institute. \n \n For his various writings about Middle Earth, J.R.R. Tolkein created the Elvish language, which like Klingon, has gone on to have a life of its own beyond these works of fiction. Adelman notes that while the Tolkein estate contends that it controls the copyright for this language, it has not yet filed lawsuits specifically claiming copyright violations. However, he notes that the estate did threaten legal action against a writer who tried to publish an analysis of currently unpublished Tolkein works written in an Elvish language. \n \n “[U]ltimately, most scholars of Tolkien’s languages are making the calculated gamble that since they are publishing obscure texts to limited audiences for no money, the Tolkien Estate will not actually haul them into court,” writes Adelman. \n \n THE ARGUMENT AGAINST COPYRIGHTING A LANGUAGE \n \n To those who believe that languages — whether created by one person or the result of centuries of human interaction — can’t be copyrighted liken this idea to trying to claim copyright of a musical scale. The Copyright Office has explicitly barred scales from eligibility, because these notes are simply generative elements upon which a copyrightable work could be constructed. \n \n For example, the first movement of György Ligeti’s Musica ricercata may be primarily made up of only two notes — A and D — it is the arrangement and expression of these two notes that is copyrightable, not the notes themselves. \n \n “It is the infinitely generative capacity of a language, the ability to communicate new thoughts and ideas, that makes a set of sounds and grammatical rules into a language,” writes Adelman, acknowledges that the actual Star Trek products and the Klingon dialogue they use are deserving of copyright, “the language itself is too generative to be held within a single copyright.” \n \n Additionally, while authors may have a direct interest in attempting to protect the integrity of the language they created, that doesn’t necessarily mean they have the legal right to stop others from using it. \n \n “No one would dispute that J.R.R. Tolkien’s integrity right in The Lord of the Rings would be infringed if someone released a version identical to the original except with all references to ‘Mordor’ replaced by ‘Candyland’,” notes Adelman, adding that “Tolkien cannot hold a right to all compositions in [the Elvish language of] Quenya any more than Noah Webster of Webster’s Dictionary can hold a right to all compositions in English.” \n \n WHAT ABOUT FAIR USE? \n \n As we recently reported, many schools are now teaching proscriptive lessons on copyright: Don’t do this, don’t do that… or you’ll get sued. What’s not being taught in these cases is the Fair Use doctrine, which lays out guidelines for when it’s okay to take something you didn’t create and use it in your own work. \n \n The doctrine grants exceptions to copyright when works are used for the purpose of criticism, comment, news reporting, and education. And Adelman contends that — even if you could successfully argue that a fictional language is copyrightable — “fair use would protect most of the activities” of people who are accused of violating that copyright. \n \n But again, the problem faced here by people looking to use a constructed language would likely be cost. How much can one afford to spend on arguing the fair use of Klingon or Elvish when the financial rewards of being able to do so are likely minimal. Thus, few pursue this argument through the legal system. \n \n The debate over the copyright for Klingon is just one, small aspect of the current lawsuit filed by Paramount, so it’s possible that the court could make a decision in this case without giving full consideration to the language debate. \n \n Of course, if the copyrightable nature of the Batmobile can get inches away from being heard by the Supreme Court, it’s possible that someone willing to put in the time, money, and effort could ultimately get the court system to settle the issue of whether or not we need an author’s permission to use their made-up language. \n \n [via TorrentFreak.com]', 'THANK YOU ALL!

Why were the Constitution class ships so important to Starfleet? How did Garth of Izar come to be regarded as the greatest Starfleet Captain of his time? \n \n \n \n This Kickstarter is for Prelude to Axanar, which we will film at the beginning of May. The Kickstarter for Prelude will pay for the actors, the make-up, visual effects and actual filming costs. The resulting film will be about 20 minutes and also produce about half a dozen vignettes of the characters talking about different subjects. \n \n \n \n Prelude to Axanar will then allow us to launch into Axanar having proven our ability to deliver professional quality Star Trek. There will be a subsequent Kickstarter for the feature-length ""Axanar"". \n \n The Axanar team is determined to make the first true independent Star Trek film. \n \n THE STARS OF PRELUDE TO AXANAR \n \n Prelude to Axanar features some well known actors portraying both new and familiar characters in the Star Trek universe. \n \n Richard Hatch as Kharn, the Klingon Supreme Commander \n \n Michael Hogan As Captain Robert April \n \n JG Hertzler as Captain Samuel Travis \n \n Gary Graham as Soval, Vulcan Ambassador to the Federation \n \n THE VISUAL EFFECTS OF AXANAR \n \n Prelude to Axanar has the amazing talents of Tobias Richter, one of the top Visual Effects artists in the world. What you have seen in our videos is all Tobias and his crew. \n \n You\'ll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Those who donated $ 75 or more will get a printed 11"" x 17"" version to go with their original Juan Ortiz poster perk. \n \n $ 40,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED Everyone who has donated $ 10 or more will receive the Federation Historical Society Vinyl sticker. \n \n $ 50,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED Everyone who has donated $ 10 or more will receive the ""First to the Fight"" Starfleet fleet patch. \n \n (Please note, for those donating at $ 20 or less, there is a small shipping fee since otherwise we are not shipping anything to you as everything is digital. All other levels we will just put these stretch goal perks in what we are already shipping you!) \n \n Ares Class Development Patch \n \n Please note that for all levels below $ 25, there will be a small shipping charge for all stretch goal perks. \n \n WHERE THE MONEY GOES \n \n First, understand that generally, you get about 70% of the total money raised. 10% goes to Kickstarter and Amazon payment processing fees. Another 10% we have budgeted for Perks (the gifts you earn at different donation levels). And there is generally a 10% drop out rate (which we hope is way less!). So basically we get 70% to spend on Prelude to Axanar. \n \n The budget for Prelude to Axanar was about $ 20,000. But thanks to all your donations, we have doubled that to $ 40,000, allowing us to do everything better and more professionally. We set the Kickstarter bar low at $ 10,000 as we really didn\'t know what kind of response we would get. We could have gotten Prelude done for $ 10,000, but it would have meant deferring payment to our VFX team and others, who graciously offered to work and take payment after the main Kickstarter if needed. So now we don\'t have to do that, or cut any corners. So the first $ 40,000 goes to Prelude. So to get that $ 40,000, we need to raise about $ 57,000 (remember we only get 70%), which we have done. \n \n What does that pay for? Well, first we need about $ 10,000 for make up. That is because we need to get all the initial design, sculpting and production of Richard Hatch\'s Klingon hair and make-up and Gary Graham\'s hair and make-up done up front. The good news is that money doesn\'t then need to be spent in Axanar. We have Make Up Effects Lab, the guys who actually worked on Star Trek since the beginning of TNG working with us, so you know we are getting the best. \n \n We also need about $ 10,000 to pay the actors and their expenses (Michael Hogan and JG Hertzler do not live in LA). When you get such amazing actors as we have gotten, you have to pay them because this is how they make a living. And we want them very invested in our project and to go above and beyond. For example, Richard Hatch (who is also my acting coach) has opened up his Tuesday acting class to our production to do rehearsals and scene work in class. That is an amazing opportunity. Gary Graham said he was going to come by to work with the other actors in the class. So if you want these professionals to be invested in your production, you need to invest in them. We have expanded our cast thanks to this Kickstarter. \n \n Then, there is the Visual Effects. That is $7,500 right now. That leaves $12,500 for the shoot itself. All those numbers are pretty accurate, but you never know what pops up. So it is nice to have a cushion. \n \n So again, to get that $ 40,000, we need to raise about $ 57,000. And thank you all for helping us reach that! \n \n Limited Edition Starfleet Procurement Patch available ONLY to donors! \n \n So what about what we raise above that? Well, first it will be nice to have a cushion in case we experience any cost overruns. But mostly, anything above the $ 57,000 or so will go into our Axanar infrastructure. So here is where that money goes: \n \n Infrastructure - We are spending $ 10,000 to fund the infrastructure of Axanar Productions. This means the legal paperwork needed to create our production company and the rather expensive insurance to cover all our productions over the coming year. It allows us to set up production offices (We have gotten the space for free in some amazing offices here in Los Angeles) and start to produce Axanar. \n \n Starfleet Tunics - $ 10,000 allows us to fund the Starfleet costumes for Axanar. We have retained the services of the company that produces the TOS tunic replicas for Anovos, so you know these tunics will be top quality. With a large cast, and needing to custom manufacture top quality costumes in quantity, we need to do it right. Making the Starfleet tunics will actually take 90 days from beginning to end. \n \n VFX - $ 10,000 goes to start paying Tobias Richter and his team for the work they are doing on Axanar. Tobias has already started putting out some amazing work and has spent days and days honing the look of the 3D ship models. \n \n USS Ares \n \n So there you go! That is where your money is going. Rest assured that whatever money we raise will go towards bringing you the Star Trek you all want to see. We take our responsibility to you seriously and appreciate that you have invested with us! \n \n We take PayPal!

More problematically, what does it mean for a corporation to assert ownership of a language that has at least one native speaker (who may or may not have rated this amazing crib) and many more who speak it daily as a second conversational language, hosting learned workshops on their chosen language. \n \n Paramount also asserts a copyright in the designs of Klingon ships and ""spacedocks,"" citing a controversial 2015 ruling that held that the Batmobile was a ""character"" and subject to copyright restrictions. \n \n However, Paramount and CBS disagree (bIlughbe’*). In their reply the rightsholders call the argument absurd and among other things, they point out that the language system is not very useful if there are no real Klingons to communicate with. “This argument is absurd, since a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no Klingons with whom to communicate,” they write (full filing: pdf). “Defendants’ use of the Klingon language in their works is simply further evidence of their infringement of Plaintiffs’ characters, since speaking this fictitious language is an aspect of their characters.” \n \n PARAMOUNT: WE OWN THE KLINGON LANGUAGE [Ernesto/Torrentfreak] \n \n report this ad']",3,"– Live long and copyright many things. Thus Paramount Pictures hopes to prosper as it wages a legal battle with the makers of popular Kickstarter crowdfunded Star Trek fan film Prelude to Axanar. Paramount claims the film's use of the fictional language Klingon adds up to copyright infringement; the filmmakers contend that attempting to copyright Klingon is absurd given the language is an ""idea or a system."" For legal precedent, they cite the system of bookkeeping: ""Although copyright protects the author’s expression of the system, it does not prevent others from using the system."" But there's doesn't appear to be a quick and easy answer. The US Copyright Office doesn't specifically ""deal with the copyrightability of constructed or fictional languages, let alone Klingon,"" observes Consumerist, which was unable to dig up much in the way of case law on the matter. Paramount, which claims exclusive ownership over many Star Trek features, including characters, themes, plots, dialogue, settings, props, character makeup, costumes, sets, fictional language, and so forth, has responded to the filmmakers' plea by noting that ""a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no Klingons with whom to communicate,"" reports TorrentFreak. By allowing the characters in Prelude to speak Klingon, they assert, the film is infringing on Paramount's characters because speaking the language ""is an aspect of their characters."" The jury's still out, but Boing Boing goes so far as to call this Paramount's attempt to ""kill"" the film, and it frames Paramount's claims as ""dubious,"" in part because it borrows phonemes (from Hindi, Arabic, etc.) as well as grammar (from Japanese, Turkish, etc.)—not to mention it's spoken by many fans around the world. (Here's one wild use of Klingon in the real world.)"
"['The Colchester Zoo in England is home to a community of mandrills, the largest of the monkeys. One of these mandrills, a female named Milly, began covering her eyes with her hand when she was three. A dozen years later Milly and her zoo mates continue to perform this gesture, which appears to mean “do not disturb.” The signal is the first gesture with cultural roots reported in monkeys. \n \n Culture accounts for behavioral differences that are geo\xadgraphic, rather than genetic or environmental. Gestures—nonvocal, communicative actions—are often cultural in humans and sometimes in apes, notes Mark E. Laidre, an evolutionary biologist now at the University of California, Berkeley. Laidre observed the Colchester mandrills for a total of 100 hours during the summers of 2007 and 2008. As re\xadported in PLoS ONE in February, he found that mandrills performing the eye-covering gesture were approached and touched by other mandrills significantly less than when they were not using the gesture. “Animals who didn’t want to be bothered used it,” Laidre says. \n \n Laidre and other researchers studying mandrills have not seen the eye-covering gesture in other populations, indicating it is a local phenomenon. Laidre also ruled out alternative explanations for the gesture’s appearance. Milly does not have any medical issues with her eyes that might have prompted her to cover them, nor is the gesture more com\xad-mon on sunny days. It is also unlikely that human activity influenced the mandrills because monkeys—in contrast to apes, dolphins and dogs—do not mimic human behavior, Laidre says. All this evidence suggests that the eye-covering gesture arose naturally and that it conveys information within the mandrill community. \n \n Having brought attention to the Colchester mandrills’ gestural abilities, Laidre expects researchers will now find other monkeys using cultural gestures. If gesturing is per\xadformed more broadly among primates than previously thought, Laidre says, “the capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have existed a long time before humans came on the scene.” \n \n This article was originally published with the title A Signal for Solitude.', 'Monkeys learn to cover their eyes when they want to be left alone Monkeys at Colchester Zoo have invented a unique do not disturb sign that has amazed experts. \n \n Photo: Eastnews Press Agency']",2,"– Monkeys at a British zoo have developed a way of saying ""leave me alone"" that doesn't involve biting or flinging poop. The mandrills cover their eyes—much like in the ""see no evil"" gesture—when they desire solitude, and their fellow monkeys respect the signal, the Telegraph reports. Researchers believe that a member of the group invented the sign and other monkeys picked it up in a never-before-witnessed example of monkeys creating sign language within their own community. The researcher who observed the phenomenon says he has been observing mandrills for years and never seen the gesture used anywhere else. Further research is likely to turn up more monkey gestures invented for cultural reasons, suggesting that ""the capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have existed a long time before humans came on the scene,"" he tells Scientific American."

"['In a match made in hippie heaven, Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio will join the four living original members of The Grateful Dead for three 50th-anniversary shows July 3-5 at Soldier Field in Chicago. The Dead\'s last performance with Jerry Garcia, who died in August 1995, was at the same 55,000-seat capacity venue on July 9, 1995. \n \n Grateful Dead Q&A;: Bob Weir & Trey Anastasio on How It All Came Together \n \n The sense of closure is no \xadaccident: These shows are likely to be the finale for the ""core four,"" as the \xadsurviving members are now known: Bob Weir, 67; Phil Lesh, 74; Mickey Hart, 71; and Bill Kreutzmann, 68. ""These will be the last shows with the four of us together,"" Weir tells Billboard. \n \n ""That\'s why we\'re doing it in Chicago,"" says Peter Shapiro, 42, who\'s producing the shows in association with AEG-owned Madison House Presents. ""They\'re the great American rock\'n\'roll band returning to where it ended, 20 years later."" \n \n Anastasio is set to take the stage with the band, along with keyboardist Bruce Hornsby, a frequent player with the Dead during the \'80s and into the \'90s, and Jeff Chimenti, who plays keys with Weir\'s side project, RatDog. ""We had to sort through a number of options,"" says Weir. ""Were we going to do a festival-style event or go back to our classic mode of an evening with the band? We narrowed it down to: Let\'s just do it simple and clean."" \n \n Competition to land the coveted booking was stiff, with such players as Goldenvoice\'s Paul Tollett and Live Nation mounting efforts to reunite the Dead at venues like the Empire Polo Grounds in Indio, Calif., the site of Coachella, and Bonnaroo (the latter, according to sources, offered the band $3 million for a headlining set -- and was rejected). It helped that Shapiro has an exclusive contract with Lesh and co-owns three Brooklyn Bowl locations (Las Vegas and London opened in 2014) that are favorites of jam bands, as well as the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, N.Y., where Anastasio previously had joined Weir onstage. \n \n The Phish frontman says that accepting the invitation was a no-brainer. ""I got a really heart-warming letter from Phil saying that he and the other three guys had talked about it and hoped I would do it,"" Anastasio tells Billboard. ""I didn\'t hesitate for a second to say yes. It\'s an absolute honor to be part of this final chapter."" \n \n In the tradition of the original Grateful Dead Ticketing Service, tickets for the shows -- named Fare Thee Well for a lyric in the Garcia/Robert Hunter song ""Brokedown Palace"" -- will be available to fan club members on a first-come, first-served basis from Feb. 9 to 11. A local public presale will occur Feb. 12-13; a general public on-sale starts Feb. 14. Jerry Garcia\'s daughter Trixie Garcia will officially announce the shows on Dead50.net today (Jan. 16). \n \n Both of these iconic bands have had historic success in the live arena. During its last 10 years on the road, the Dead grossed more than $200 million from 350 shows, according to Billboard Boxscore; Phish ranks among today\'s top touring acts, grossing more than $30 million in 2014, $4 million during its four-night New Year\'s Eve run at Miami\'s American Airlines Arena alone. Melding the followings of both acts could potentially inject some $50 million into Chicago\'s local economy (in addition to marketing the 20th anniversary of the Dead\'s last show, the city was chosen for ease of travel). \n \n Still, there is substantial risk involved. Given that the Dead have no recent touring history indicating they could support a triple stadium play, producers are treating this as a true one-of-a-kind destination event, a la Led Zeppelin at the O2 in London in 2007. But for millions of fans, the significance of these gigs goes beyond the bottom line -- most considered such a pairing purely a thing of fantasy. \n \n The Grateful Dead: A Billboard Chart History \n \n Even Anastasio is giddy. ""I saw my first Dead show at the Hartford Civic Center in 1980 when I was 16,"" he says. ""After that, I went to as many shows as I could, sometimes even standing right in front of Jerry, up on the rail, a few feet away from his amplifier. I\'ve been listening, going through the history, and it has been really fun."" Adds Weir: ""Trey is schooled in what we call \'the fluid tonic\': listening intently to what\'s going on and reacting meaningfully to what other people are playing."" \n \n The connection between the Dead and Phish, who had only a few years of crossover early in Phish\'s career while Garcia was still alive, has long been viewed as a sort of passing of the baton from one generation of like-minded music fans to the next. But when it comes to the players, offers Weir, ""The comparison is just apples and oranges -- they have their flavor, we have ours."" \n \n For his part, Anastasio sees the Dead\'s place as the quintessential American band. ""I\'ve realized that it\'s no coincidence that they named their best album ever American Beauty,"" he says. ""Jerry Garcia was a great American master and the Grateful Dead are not just a genuine piece of musical history, but also an important part of American history. This is a band, born right at the beginning of electric rock, that took the American tradition and moved it forward. They really embodied the American concept of freedom, rolling around the country with a ginormous gang of people and the mindset that \'you can come if you want, you can leave if you want. We don\'t know what\'s going to happen. All we know is we\'re not looking back.\' What could be more American?"" \n \n Grateful Dead Documentary in the Works With Martin Scorsese \n \n Anastasio\'s enthusiasm is shared by the Dead\'s members. ""The Grateful Dead lived an incredible musical story and now we get to write a whole new chapter,"" said Kreutzmann in an announcement issued on Friday. \n \n Added Lesh: ""It is with respect and gratitude that we reconvene the Dead one last time to celebrate - not merely the band\'s legacy, but also the community that we\'ve been playing to, and with, for fifty years."" \n \n ""I have a feeling this will come out just right,"" offered Mickey Hart. ""Can\'t wait to find out…HERE WE GO!"" \n \n The one remaining burning question: will the Core Four return to touring as the Grateful Dead? Weir says it\'s unlikely that the Chicago bow will be part of a longer run, it\'s by no means the end of the road. ""I know we\'ll all continue playing this music forever in our own ways,"" he says. ""I\'ve got some miles left in me."" \n \n With reporting by Ray Waddell \n \n An edited version of this article first appeared in the Jan. 24 issue of Billboard.', 'There is still time to rock and revel in celebration of America\'s greatest rock band, the Grateful Dead. \n \n MLBAM is giving fans an exclusive offer to purchase all five nights of ""Fare Thee Well"" on-demand for $49.95.

He’d had five children already by his first wife (though four had died in infancy), and fatherhood was not on his mind. “Before six beats of the pulse had intervened,” as he later wrote to the Royal Society of London, Leeuwenhoek was examining his perishable sample through a tiny magnifying glass. Its lens, no bigger than a small raindrop, magnified objects hundreds of times. Leeuwenhoek had made it himself; nobody else had one so powerful. The learned men in London were still trying to verify Leeuwenhoek’s earlier claims that unseen “animalcules” lived by the millions in a single drop of lake water and even in French wine. Now he had something more delicate to report: Human semen contained animalcules too. “Sometimes more than a thousand,” he wrote, “in an amount of material the size of a grain of sand.” Pressing the glass to his eye like a jeweler, Leeuwenhoek watched his own animalcules swim about, lashing their long tails. One imagines sunlight falling through leaded windows on a face lost in contemplation, as in the Vermeers. One feels for his wife. \n \n Leeuwenhoek became a bit obsessed after that. Though his tiny peephole gave him privileged access to a never-before-seen microscopic universe, he spent an enormous amount of time looking at spermatozoa, as they’re now called. Oddly enough, it was the milt he squeezed from a cod one day that inspired him to estimate, almost casually, just how many people might live on Earth. \n \n Nobody then really had any idea; there were few censuses. Leeuwenhoek started with an estimate that around a million people lived in Holland. Using maps and a little spherical geometry, he calculated that the inhabited land area of the planet was 13,385 times as large as Holland. It was hard to imagine the whole planet being as densely peopled as Holland, which seemed crowded even then. Thus, Leeuwenhoek concluded triumphantly, there couldn’t be more than 13.385 billion people on Earth—a small number indeed compared with the 150 billion sperm cells of a single codfish! This cheerful little calculation, writes population biologist Joel Cohen in his book How Many People Can the Earth Support?, may have been the first attempt to give a quantitative answer to a question that has become far more pressing now than it was in the 17th century. Most answers these days are far from cheerful. \n \n Historians now estimate that in Leeuwenhoek’s day there were only half a billion or so humans on Earth. After rising very slowly for millennia, the number was just starting to take off. A century and a half later, when another scientist reported the discovery of human egg cells, the world’s population had doubled to more than a billion. A century after that, around 1930, it had doubled again to two billion. The acceleration since then has been astounding. Before the 20th century, no human had lived through a doubling of the human population, but there are people alive today who have seen it triple. Sometime in late 2011, according to the UN Population Division, there will be seven billion of us. (Pictures: Population 7 Billion.) \n \n And the explosion, though it is slowing, is far from over. Not only are people living longer, but so many women across the world are now in their childbearing years—1.8 billion—that the global population will keep growing for another few decades at least, even though each woman is having fewer children than she would have had a generation ago. By 2050 the total number could reach 10.5 billion, or it could stop at eight billion—the difference is about one child per woman. UN demographers consider the middle road their best estimate: They now project that the population may reach nine billion before 2050—in 2045. The eventual tally will depend on the choices individual couples make when they engage in that most intimate of human acts, the one Leeuwenhoek interrupted so carelessly for the sake of science. \n \n With the population still growing by about 80 million each year, it’s hard not to be alarmed. Right now on Earth, water tables are falling, soil is eroding, glaciers are melting, and fish stocks are vanishing. Close to a billion people go hungry each day. Decades from now, there will likely be two billion more mouths to feed, mostly in poor countries. There will be billions more people wanting and deserving to boost themselves out of poverty. If they follow the path blazed by wealthy countries—clearing forests, burning coal and oil, freely scattering fertilizers and pesticides—they too will be stepping hard on the planet’s natural resources. How exactly is this going to work? \n \n THERE MAY BE SOME COMFORT in knowing that people have long been alarmed about population. From the beginning, says French demographer Hervé Le Bras, demography has been steeped in talk of the apocalypse. Some of the field’s founding papers were written just a few years after Leeuwenhoek’s discovery by Sir William Petty, a founder of the Royal Society. He estimated that world population would double six times by the Last Judgment, which was expected in about 2,000 years. At that point it would exceed 20 billion people—more, Petty thought, than the planet could feed. “And then, according to the prediction of the Scriptures, there must be wars, and great slaughter, &c.;,” he wrote. \n \n As religious forecasts of the world’s end receded, Le Bras argues, population growth itself provided an ersatz mechanism of apocalypse. “It crystallized the ancient fear, and perhaps the ancient hope, of the end of days,” he writes. In 1798 Thomas Malthus, an English priest and economist, enunciated his general law of population: that it necessarily grows faster than the food supply, until war, disease, and famine arrive to reduce the number of people. As it turned out, the last plagues great enough to put a dent in global population had already happened when Malthus wrote. World population hasn’t fallen, historians think, since the Black Death of the 14th century. \n \n In the two centuries after Malthus declared that population couldn’t continue to soar, that’s exactly what it did. The process started in what we now call the developed countries, which were then still developing. The spread of New World crops like corn and the potato, along with the discovery of chemical fertilizers, helped banish starvation in Europe. Growing cities remained cesspools of disease at first, but from the mid-19th century on, sewers began to channel human waste away from drinking water, which was then filtered and chlorinated; that dramatically reduced the spread of cholera and typhus. \n \n Moreover in 1798, the same year that Malthus published his dyspeptic tract, his compatriot Edward Jenner described a vaccine for smallpox—the first and most important in a series of vaccines and antibiotics that, along with better nutrition and sanitation, would double life expectancy in the industrializing countries, from 35 years to 77 today. It would take a cranky person to see that trend as gloomy: “The development of medical science was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” wrote Stanford population biologist Paul Ehrlich in 1968. \n \n Ehrlich’s book, The Population Bomb, made him the most famous of modern Malthusians. In the 1970s, Ehrlich predicted, “hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death,” and it was too late to do anything about it. “The cancer of population growth … must be cut out,” Ehrlich wrote, “by compulsion if voluntary methods fail.” The very future of the United States was at risk. In spite or perhaps because of such language, the book was a best seller, as Malthus’s had been. And this time too the bomb proved a dud. The green revolution—a combination of high-yield seeds, irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers that enabled grain production to double—was already under way. Today many people are undernourished, but mass starvation is rare. \n \n Ehrlich was right, though, that population would surge as medical science spared many lives. After World War II the developing countries got a sudden transfusion of preventive care, with the help of institutions like the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Penicillin, the smallpox vaccine, DDT (which, though later controversial, saved millions from dying of malaria)—all arrived at once. In India life expectancy went from 38 years in 1952 to 64 today; in China, from 41 to 73. Millions of people in developing countries who would have died in childhood survived to have children themselves. That’s why the population explosion spread around the planet: because a great many people were saved from dying. \n \n And because, for a time, women kept giving birth at a high rate. In 18th-century Europe or early 20th-century Asia, when the average woman had six children, she was doing what it took to replace herself and her mate, because most of those children never reached adulthood. When child mortality declines, couples eventually have fewer children—but that transition usually takes a generation at the very least. Today in developed countries, an average of 2.1 births per woman would maintain a steady population; in the developing world, “replacement fertility” is somewhat higher. In the time it takes for the birthrate to settle into that new balance with the death rate, population explodes. \n \n Demographers call this evolution the demographic transition. All countries go through it in their own time. It’s a hallmark of human progress: In a country that has completed the transition, people have wrested from nature at least some control over death and birth. The global population explosion is an inevitable side effect, a huge one that some people are not sure our civilization can survive. But the growth rate was actually at its peak just as Ehrlich was sounding his alarm. By the early 1970s, fertility rates around the world had begun dropping faster than anyone had anticipated. Since then, the population growth rate has fallen by more than 40 percent. \n \n THE FERTILITY DECLINE that is now sweeping the planet started at different times in different countries. France was one of the first. By the early 18th century, noblewomen at the French court were knowing carnal pleasures without bearing more than two children. They often relied on the same method Leeuwenhoek used for his studies: withdrawal, or coitus interruptus. Village parish records show the trend had spread to the peasantry by the late 18th century; by the end of the 19th, fertility in France had fallen to three children per woman—without the help of modern contraceptives. The key innovation was conceptual, not contraceptive, says Gilles Pison of the National Institute for Demographic Studies in Paris. Until the Enlightenment, “the number of children you had, it was God who decided. People couldn’t fathom that it might be up to them.” \n \n Other countries in the West eventually followed France’s lead. By the onset of World War II, fertility had fallen close to the replacement level in parts of Europe and the U.S. Then, after the surprising blip known as the baby boom, came the bust, again catching demographers off guard. They assumed some instinct would lead women to keep having enough children to ensure the survival of the species. Instead, in country after developed country, the fertility rate fell below replacement level. In the late 1990s in Europe it fell to 1.4. “The evidence I’m familiar with, which is anecdotal, is that women couldn’t care less about replacing the species,” Joel Cohen says. \n \n The end of a baby boom can have two big economic effects on a country. The first is the “demographic dividend”—a blissful few decades when the boomers swell the labor force and the number of young and old dependents is relatively small, and there is thus a lot of money for other things. Then the second effect kicks in: The boomers start to retire. What had been considered the enduring demographic order is revealed to be a party that has to end. The sharpening American debate over Social Security and last year’s strikes in France over increasing the retirement age are responses to a problem that exists throughout the developed world: how to support an aging population. “In 2050 will there be enough people working to pay for pensions?” asks Frans Willekens, director of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute in The Hague. “The answer is no.” \n \n In industrialized countries it took generations for fertility to fall to the replacement level or below. As that same transition takes place in the rest of the world, what has astonished demographers is how much faster it is happening there. Though its population continues to grow, China, home to a fifth of the world’s people, is already below replacement fertility and has been for nearly 20 years, thanks in part to the coercive one-child policy implemented in 1979; Chinese women, who were bearing an average of six children each as recently as 1965, are now having around 1.5. In Iran, with the support of the Islamic regime, fertility has fallen more than 70 percent since the early ’80s. In Catholic and democratic Brazil, women have reduced their fertility rate by half over the same quarter century. “We still don’t understand why fertility has gone down so fast in so many societies, so many cultures and religions. It’s just mind-boggling,” says Hania Zlotnik, director of the UN Population Division. \n \n “At this moment, much as I want to say there’s still a problem of high fertility rates, it’s only about 16 percent of the world population, mostly in Africa,” says Zlotnik. South of the Sahara, fertility is still five children per woman; in Niger it is seven. But then, 17 of the countries in the region still have life expectancies of 50 or less; they have just begun the demographic transition. In most of the world, however, family size has shrunk dramatically. The UN projects that the world will reach replacement fertility by 2030. “The population as a whole is on a path toward nonexplosion—which is good news,” Zlotnik says. \n \n The bad news is that 2030 is two decades away and that the largest generation of adolescents in history will then be entering their childbearing years. Even if each of those women has only two children, population will coast upward under its own momentum for another quarter century. Is a train wreck in the offing, or will people then be able to live humanely and in a way that doesn’t destroy their environment? One thing is certain: Close to one in six of them will live in India. \n \n I have understood the population explosion intellectually for a long time. I came to understand it emotionally one stinking hot night in Delhi a couple of years ago… The temperature was well over 100, and the air was a haze of dust and smoke. The streets seemed alive with people. People eating, people washing, people sleeping. People visiting, arguing, and screaming. People thrusting their hands through the taxi window, begging. People defecating and urinating. People clinging to buses. People herding animals. People, people, people, people. —Paul Ehrlich \n \n In 1966, when Ehrlich took that taxi ride, there were around half a billion Indians. There are 1.2 billion now. Delhi’s population has increased even faster, to around 22 million, as people have flooded in from small towns and villages and crowded into sprawling shantytowns. Early last June in the stinking hot city, the summer monsoon had not yet arrived to wash the dust from the innumerable construction sites, which only added to the dust that blows in from the deserts of Rajasthan. On the new divided highways that funnel people into the unplanned city, oxcarts were heading the wrong way in the fast lane. Families of four cruised on motorbikes, the women’s scarves flapping like vivid pennants, toddlers dangling from their arms. Families of a dozen or more sardined themselves into buzzing, bumblebee-colored auto rickshaws designed for two passengers. In the stalled traffic, amputees and wasted little children cried for alms. Delhi today is boomingly different from the city Ehrlich visited, and it is also very much the same.', 'Some time late in 2011—at least according to the people-crunchers at the U.N. Population Reference Bureau—humanity will reach a new demographic milestone with the birth of the 7th billion living person. (As a measure of just how fast global population is growing, the 6th billionth living person—Bosnian Adnan Nevic—is only 11.) You can expect the event to be marked by the usual Malthusian worries—can the planet Earth really support 7 billion people, especially with the population expected to top 9 billion by mid-century? With some 1.5 billion people already living on less than $1.25 a day, nearly 1 billion people hungry and the natural world already heavily damaged, are we on the path to destruction? \n \n That’s the question the environment writer Robert Kunzig tackles in a cover story on population for National Geographic magazine. (I’ll excerpt a bit below, but it’s a great piece and worth reading in its entirety—in fact, consider picking up the issue, which tackles the 7 billion question with photos, articles and graphics.) Kunzig notes that global population has grown astoundingly fast during most of our lifetimes—while it took all of human history to around 1800 for the global population to reach 1 billion (a little Black Death here and there didn’t help), it will take a little more than 50 years for the world’s numbers to grow from 3 billion to 7 billion. A U.N. graph shows how fast population has grown, and where it might be headed: \n \n That rapid increase is due to the demographic transition—and on the surface, it’s a sign of human progress. In the past, high fertility rates were the norm around the world, as women had to have large number of children to ensure that at least a few them would survive into adulthood. (That’s often still the case in extremely poor, heavily rural countries like Niger, where the average woman has seven children.) Eventually, though, child mortality declined thanks to advances in medicine and sanitation. As women adjusted to the new reality—and as families moved from farms to cities, where additional children were more of an economic burden than a boon—the fertility rate dropped, but that took a generation or so, and in the meantime population exploded. (Suddenly there were lots more surviving children who could then go and reproduce themselves.) The U.S., Europe and other rich countries have already gone through the transition—in most well-off countries fertility is around or even well below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman—and it’s begun to happen in all but the poorest developing countries as well. (China, thanks to the one-child policy, put itself through an accelerated demographic transition.) But the transition will take a while to play itself out, and global population will keep growing rapidly, albeit unevenly—for the next several decades, eventually reaching a level as high as nearly 11 billion or 8 billion by 2050, depending on how fertility rates change in the years ahead. \n \n Either way that seems to be a lot of people—and most of them will be born in poor developing nations, to parents already struggling to support themselves. If you’ve ever visited the urban slums outside growing megacities like Bombay or Lagos you might wonder how they could take any more people—yet they’ll continue to proliferate like bacterial cultures. Those teeming slums seem to provoke a visceral disgust among the thinkers who worry most about population—like Paul Ehrlich, the author of The Population Bomb, whom Kunzig quotes: \n \n I have understood the population explosion intellectually for a long time. I came to understand it emotionally one stinking hot night in Delhi a couple of years ago… The temperature was well over 100, and the air was a haze of dust and smoke. The streets seemed alive with people. People eating, people washing, people sleeping. People visiting, arguing, and screaming. People thrusting their hands through the taxi window, begging. People defecating and urinating. People clinging to buses. People herding animals. People, people, people, people. \n \n As Kunzig notes, that was written in 1966, when India only had 500 million people—today it has 1.2 billion, and it is projected to have over 1.7 billion by mid-century, which would make it the most heavily populated nation on Earth. But the question isn’t whether we will literally have enough space for more people—Kunzig points out that if 9 billion people were spread out around the habitable parts of the planet, the entire Earth would still have only half the population density of France. The fear—from Malthus to Ehrlich—is that we won’t be able to support ourselves, that there won’t be enough food, water or energy to go around, as Kunzig wonders: \n \n Many people are justifiably worried that Malthus will finally be proved right on a global scale—that the planet won’t be able to feed nine billion people. Lester Brown, founder of Worldwatch Institute and now head of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington, believes food shortages could cause a collapse of global civilization. Human beings are living off natural capital, Brown argues, eroding soil and depleting groundwater faster than they can be replenished. All of that will soon be cramping food production. Brown’s Plan B to save civilization would put the whole world on a wartime footing, like the U.S. after Pearl Harbor, to stabilize climate and repair the ecological damage. “Filling the family planning gap may be the most urgent item on the global agenda,” he writes, so if we don’t hold the world’s population to eight billion by reducing fertility, the death rate may increase instead. Eight billion corresponds to the UN’s lowest projection for 2050. In that optimistic scenario, Bangladesh has a fertility rate of 1.35 in 2050, but it still has 25 million more people than it does today. Rwanda’s fertility rate also falls below the replacement level, but its population still rises to well over twice what it was before the genocide. If that’s the optimistic scenario, one might argue, the future is indeed bleak. \n \n I wrote earlier this week about the debate between Malthusians and Cornucopians—the economists who believe that human ingenuity, responding to human need, always prevails to find new resources to match rising populations. It’s an open question for the future, though so far the Cornucopians have been proven right. It’s worth noting that while we worry about the effects of overpopulation in the future, humanity was far worse off by every material standard in the centuries before the Industrial Revolution, when the global population was a fraction of what it is today. As Kunzig writes, the future of humanity—and of the planet we live on—will have less to do with absolute numbers that it will with how we choose to live: \n \n For centuries population pessimists have hurled apocalyptic warnings at the congenital optimists, who believe in their bones that humanity will find ways to cope and even improve its lot. History, on the whole, has so far favored the optimists, but history is no certain guide to the future. Neither is science. It cannot predict the outcome of People v. Planet, because all the facts of the case—how many of us there will be and how we will live—depend on choices we have yet to make and ideas we have yet to have. We may, for example, says [population biologist Joel] Cohen, “see to it that all children are nourished well enough to learn in school and are educated well enough to solve the problems they will face as adults.” That would change the future significantly. \n \n Indeed, growing populations won’t be the only demographic challenge the world faces in the decades to come. Remember how I said that population was growing globally but unevenly? Even as a country like India will likely need to cope with 500 million new people between now and mid-century, most rich nations—where the fertility rate is below replacement level and people live longer and longer—will need to cope with extreme aging. As the 2010 World Population fact sheet shows (download a PDF here), in Japan, Italy and Germany there are already only 3 working people to support every 1 pensioner. Compare that to sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, where the ratio is closer to 25 to 1. That disparity will only grow in the future, exacerbating budget headaches and skewing economies. In the U.S., for example, spending on Social Security and Medicare is expected to rise from 8.4% of GDP today to 14.5% by mid-century. \n \n So here’s the planet we could have in 2050: an overpopulated, overstressed developing world and an aging, economically stagnant developed world, with inequality even larger than it is today. Is there any way to escape that fate? While development and education will be incredibly important (especially for women—literacy is one of the best ways to reduce fertility), the answer may end up being immigration. Think about it—in the future the developed world will lack young workers, and the developing world will have an excess of that resource. Immigration could be a way to balance demographics and economics—alleviating population pressure in the poorer parts of the world while jump starting aging developed nations. The U.S. already does this—immigration will provide most of American population growth. It would be a radical solution, given the political resistance to increased immigration in much of the rich world. (If you think it’s a hot topic in the U.S., try Japan, which steadfastly resists assimilating foreigners, despite the dire threat posed by an aging population.) But it might be the only way to save our overpopulated planet. \n \n More from TIME on population: \n \n What Condoms Have to Do With Climate Change \n \n Population: The Numbers Game']",2,"– Things to look forward to in 2011: all-natural Frito-Lay chips, a bunch of truly unnecessary movie sequels, and … the world’s 7 billionth living person. That lucky baby will arrive sometime next year, according to the UN Population Reference Bureau, writes Bryan Walsh for Time. The world’s 6 billionth living person was born just 11 years ago in Bosnia, and the population is expected to exceed 9 billion by the middle of the century. Can the planet really handle that? Robert Kunzig attempts to take on that question in a very lengthy National Geographic cover story (worth a read). Walsh picks out a few highlights: Kunzig calls out attention to the fact that it took nearly all of human history to get us to the 1 billion mark, but we're set to explode from 3 billion to 7 billion in about 50 years. By 2050, we'll be somewhere between 8 billion and 10.5 billion, according to the UN. Space isn't the issue. Kunzig notes that if 9 billion people were spread throughout Earth's habitable regions, the population density would be half of that in France. The potential problems: Not enough food, water, energy. And a lot of aging people. Writes Kunzig, ""Fixating on population numbers is not the best way to confront the future. The number of people does matter, of course. But how people consume resources matters a lot more ... It’s too late to keep the new middle class of 2030 from being born; it’s not too late to change how they and the rest of us will produce and consume food and energy."""
"['The producer Dino De Laurentiis, a loopy genius who knew a thing or two about big-screen great apes, once said of his own 1976 King Kong star, ""When the monkey die, people gonna cry."" Fortunately, the monkey in Jordan Vogt-Roberts\' exhilarating and pleasingly strange fantasy-adventure Kong: Skull Island doesn\'t suffer the same fate. Instead, this Kong looms large as a protector of the weak and a steward of the natural world. He\'s the king of all he surveys. As in the original, that\'s a mysterious, lost-in-time island, one that an ambitious explorer--played by John Goodman, in full wheeling-dealing mode--is hell-bent on exposing to the world. \n \n Tagging along are valiant combat photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson , radiant in that 1970s Bonne Bell no-makeup way) and studly-but-elegant soldier of fortune James Conrad (played by studly-but-elegant Tom Hiddleston ). There\'s also a military escort, led by an army officer spoiling for a fight, played by Samuel L. Jackson--it\'s 1973, in the waning days of the Vietnam conflict, and he\'s still smarting from the effects of a war that couldn\'t be won. His bad attitude spells trouble, especially when he crosses a certain beast of distinction. \n \n MORE 5 Photos That Show How King Kong Revolutionized Movie Special Effects \n \n Kong: Skull Island isn\'t a remake of an earlier King Kong movie, but more of a reimagining. If this Kong has one problem, it\'s this: there are too many humans. The sprawling ensemble includes a duo of science types (Corey Hawkins and Jing Tian) and a gaggle of soldiers, the most distinctive among them played by Toby Kebbell. (Kebbell portrayed a motion-capture primate in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes --he contributed a few facial expressions to Kong\'s repertoire in this film, but the character is played chiefly by movement coach Terry Notary.) \n \n Kong: Skull Island is still great fun, if occasionally in a slightly sadistic way. Some scenes, featuring prehistoric-type critters chomping on humans, may be too intense for really little kids. But for big kids, why not? Vogt-Roberts--who has worked extensively in TV, on shows like You\'re the Worst and Single Dads --has both a sense of humor and an understanding of what we want from a creature feature. The picture is grand and nutty and visually splendid: Vogt-Roberts knows he\'s gotta go big or go home, so he treads boldly, even channeling an Apocalypse Now vibe when military choppers whirl, with ill intent, over Kong\'s tropical paradise. \n \n Vogt-Roberts knows what to do with actors too. John C. Reilly is wonderful as Hank Marlow, a World War II pilot who\'s been stranded on the island for years, living contentedly but somewhat forlornly among its natives, a tribe of sober, generous, silent people. (Vogt-Roberts gives them a resplendent entrance: their painted faces and bodies emerge, trompe l\'oeil--style, from a formation of similarly decorated rocks.) Marlow is only slightly off his rocker; mostly he\'s a whiskery, mellow charmer. When he gets a gander at pretty photographer Mason, he tells her, solemnly, ""You are more beautiful than a hot dog and a can of beer at Wrigley Field on opening day,"" his eyes glowing like state-fair pinwheels. \n \n But there can be only one king of Kong: Skull Island , and you already know who that is. This Kong protects the humans of his island--the deserving ones, that is--from its many dangers. Striding through this neverland\'s lush dream-world foliage, he\'s the principal dancer in his own primeval ballet, leathery of chest and furry of butt. His brow is broad, flat and noble. His eyes hold both the warmth and sadness of a million suns, or maybe just the memory of the giant banana he may have eaten for breakfast--but no matter what, he\'s the movie\'s soulful center. Kong lives. But he still might make you cry.', '‘Kong: Skull Island’ a fun return to the ape’s stomping ground \n \n We just won’t leave Kong enough alone, will we? \n \n For some 80 years now, through movie after movie after movie, the giant ape has been minding his own giant ape business on Skull Island. But then some pesky humans show up and try to capture him or tame him or kill him or otherwise mess with him, and the next thing you know the big guy is swatting away aircraft, roaring up a storm and defending his turf while developing a real resentment for the little pests in clothes — with the exception of the occasional sympathetic blonde who catches his eye, of course. \n \n “Kong: Skull Island” plays like a mash-up of “Apocalypse Now,” “Hamburger Hill,” “Congo,” “Jurassic Park,” even “The African Queen” — with a couple of elements so ridiculous they could have been borrowed from a “Gilligan’s Island” episode. \n \n It’s wildly entertaining and it has a sense of humor about itself — and it doesn’t hurt when a great big monster movie features an A-list cast including John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston and John C. Reilly. They’re all in a really expensive B-movie and it seems like they’re having a heckuva time fighting the good green-screen fight against all manner of lethal creatures on Skull Island. \n \n Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and the team of screenwriters set this version of “Kong” in the summer of 1973, just as direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War is coming to end. This isn’t just some arbitrary device; the war and how it affected those who fought it (and those who fought against it) is a constant theme in “Skull Island.” \n \n The opening half hour or so feels like more like a Vietnam film than a monster movie, with the soundtrack blasting classic rock staples such as “White Rabbit,” “Run Through the Jungle,” “Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress” and “Paranoid,” as the main characters are introduced and the mission to Skull Island is set in motion. \n \n John Goodman’s Bill Randa is an old-school secret ops conspiracy theorist near the end of his career. With anti-war protests raging in the streets of the capital, Randa remarks to an associate, “Mark my words, there’ll never be a more screwed-up time in Washington,” and yes, that line is destined to elicit big-time laughs. \n \n Randa secures funding for a fact-finding mission to the mysterious Skull Island. The team includes a military escort led by Lt. Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), who is still seething with anger over the U.S. pulling out of Vietnam; Capt. Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), the obligatory former black ops legend now working for himself, and combat photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), who is along for the ride because, hey, we need Brie Larson along for this ride. \n \n Director Vogt-Roberts, cinematographer Larry Fong and the special-effects wizards produce some remarkable visuals during the arrival at Skull Island, with helicopters swooping in formation, attention-grabbing slow-motion moments, and perfectly timed moments of comedic relief followed by the shocking (and pretty rough for PG-13) violence. It’s great stuff. \n \n Oddly enough, once we settle in for the Kong part of the movie, “Skull Island” isn’t quite as entertaining or edgy. It turns into a full-fledged monster movie, as the exploration team quickly learns the enormous monkey is just one of the astonishing and deadly creatures inhabiting the island. Relax for a second, and you could be consumed or crushed by a huge spider or a gigantic lizard thingy or a squid the size of a ship — or maybe you’ll be plucked off the ground and torn apart by a flock of prehistoric-looking birds! \n \n As Col. Packard starts going full Col. Kurtz, obsessed with his mission against all odds and logic, Capt. Conrad and Mason the Photographer and a few others stumble upon one Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a World War II pilot from Chicago who has been stranded on Skull Island for nearly 30 years. (“Have the Cubs won the World Series yet?” asks Hank.) \n \n The stuff with Hank is beyond goofy — but Reilly plays the comic relief role to the hilt, firing off a few terrific one-liners. By that point, “Skull Island” has lost its sense of menace and has gone a little soft, even as a few supporting characters meet some pretty grisly deaths. (As usual, the MPAA’s ratings board is much more forgiving about multiple gruesome killings than language or nudity when it comes to handing out a PG-13.) \n \n Hiddleston is solid as an old-fashioned, dashing leading man. Larson is wonderful as the plucky Mason. Jackson and Goodman are as reliable as Jackson and Goodman always are, in just about any genre. \n \n As for King Kong: he might have to look for another address, because for being so mysterious and secretive and elusive, Skull Island sure brings in a lot of nosy tourists. \n \n ★★★ \n \n Warner Brothers presents a film directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts and written by Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly. Rated PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for brief strong language). Running time: 118 minutes. Opens Friday at local theaters.', 'Kong: Skull Island is, reportedly, a reboot of the original King Kong from 1933. At the same time, it features a ton of dinosaurs and prehistoric creepy-crawlies in a not-so-subtle nod to Jurassic Park (1993). The presence of helicopters, napalm, psychedelic rock and two characters named Conrad and Marlow mean you might equally consider it a remix of Apocalypse Now (1979) or its source material, Heart of Darkness. I also caught trace elements of Flight of the Phoenix (2004) and Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). The resulting film bears some relation to the menu at my local Chinese restaurant, which lists “soup with sweetcorn,” “soup with noodles” and “soup with egg drop"" before reaching—with an air of summary exasperation or exhaustion—“soup with everything.” That’s pretty much what we get here: soup with everything. \n \n We start in Washington, D.C., where a bearish conspiracy nut (John Goodman, naturally) is petitioning his senator for money to explore an island in the South Pacific with his team of geologists. He is granted the protection of a full Army helicopter squadron, loaded to the gills with napalm and machine guns, led by an irascible lieutenant (Samuel L. Jackson) fresh from the fields of Vietnam. The whole movie is set in 1973, quite possibly because the filmmakers judged it to be the one period so whacked-out on drugs that nobody would raise any objection to the plot. Also along for the ride are a British Special Air Service officer and jungle survival expert (Tom Hiddleston) and a magazine photographer (Brie Larson). “Isn’t this a little small for a Time photographer?” Hiddleston asks her. “How did British special forces get dragged into this?” Larson asks him. When half your characters devote most of their screen time to exploring the motivations of the other half, you know something is amiss. \n \n How difficult can it be to get people to go to explore an island? But then the film, which was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts from a script by Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein, is driven less by curiosity about exploring the great unknown than by an urgent need to have everyone arrive at the threshold of the great unknown, guns drawn, and start blasting. The film begins where most Kong movies end: with the giant ape swatting aircraft from the skies as if they were flies. \n \n And so the team is stranded, as Goodman puts it, on Skull Island, “a place where myth and science meet.” Or as I came to think of it, the land where backstory goes to die. Everyone has to fight through great thickets of prehistory, and not just the dinosaurs. Equally Jurassic is the wild-eyed, shaggy-bearded pilot (John C. Reilly) whom the team discovers in the jungle, where he’s been lurking since World War II . Then there is Kong himself, orphaned at a young age after giant lizards eat his parents, engaged ever since in a prolonged but unsuccessful battle with his rage issues. What he should really do is book himself a ticket to New York, head for the Upper West Side and find himself a good therapist, but as its title suggests, Kong: Skull Island is as hung up on Kong’s island as on the great ape himself. We get a full flora and fauna report, including ants, spiders, lizards and squid. It’s like a version of Superman that can’t work up the puff to get out of Smallville. \n \n The original was a fable about American colonialism, as well as a Beauty and the Beast love story about the ultimate romantic martyr, but Larson snatches just one brief, swoony moment with Kong. This is a combat picture, pure and simple, led from the front by Jackson, who glimpses his nemesis through great plumes of fire, clenches his teeth and vows, “This is one war we’re not going to lose.” The visuals have a high ick factor (intestines pulled through mouths, vomited skulls) but sometimes attain a nutty pop grandeur: I loved the sight of Hiddleston wearing a gas mask, using a samurai sword to slice his way through a flock of pterodactyls in a purple haze. Far out. Jimi Hendrix would dig it. \n \n It’s the usual story: a lopsided mixture of mega-blast effects and a script that hasn\'t worked out what opposable thumbs are for. “This is beyond us,” says Reilly, stealing every scene in sight with daffy riffs about gods and monsters, like Dennis Hopper’s gadfly photographer in Apocalypse Now. You’d say he was the comic relief, except Kong: Skull Island can’t seem to manage seriousness in the first place. Quit monkeying around.']",3,"– A team sets out to explore a mysterious island in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and soon discovers the fist of a massive monkey in Kong: Skull Island. It might be a familiar story, but critics are mostly applauding Jordan Vogt-Roberts' telling. Here's what they’re saying: Richard Roeper calls it a ""wildly entertaining"" B-movie with an A-list cast. Among its best qualities are ""remarkable visuals"" and ""perfectly timed moments of comedic relief,"" he writes at the Chicago Sun-Times. For those who want it, there's ""shocking violence,"" too, yet the film also ""has a sense of humor about itself,"" Roeper says. ""It's great stuff."" For a film that takes inspiration from Apocalypse Now, Kong: Skull Island is ""surprisingly fun and fresh,"" writes Katie Walsh at the Tribune News Service. But though ""never boring,"" it also ""never sits still,"" a fault Walsh blames on too many characters. Samuel L. Jackson's Col. Packard isn't one she'd be willing to lose, though. He's ""riveting."" Tom Shone was not on the same page. Here's ""the usual story: a lopsided mixture of mega-blast effects and a script that hasn't worked out what opposable thumbs are for,"" he writes at Newsweek. Thank goodness for John C. Reilly ""stealing every scene,"" he adds. ""You'd say he was the comic relief, except Kong: Skull Island can't seem to manage seriousness in the first place. Quit monkeying around."" Stephanie Zacharek agrees Reilly is ""wonderful,"" but that's not all she has to admire. ""Vogt-Roberts knows he's gotta go big or go home, so he treads boldly."" The result is a film that's ""great fun"" as well as ""grand and nutty and visually splendid,"" she writes at Time. The real star, however, is Kong. ""He's the movie's soulful center"" and might even ""make you cry."""
"['Syria Red Crescent bid to rescue Homs journalists fails \n \n Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. \n \n Fresh attempts to evacuate two wounded Western journalists from Homs in Syria have failed, the Red Cross says. \n \n Vehicles from the Syrian Red Crescent reached the besieged suburb of Baba Amr, but left without them. \n \n Frenchwoman Edith Bouvier would not board vehicles, reports said, and other evacuees, including UK photographer Paul Conroy, stayed in solidarity. \n \n Earlier, Syrian forces launched fresh attacks on a number of towns, reports say, with dozens more people killed. \n \n The Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), an activists\' group which organises and documents protests, said a total of 125 people had died across Syria, many of them in a single incident at a checkpoint in Homs - although there has been no independent verification of this. \n \n Broken leg \n \n Reports on Monday evening said the Syrian Red Crescent had managed to regain access to Baba Amr but officials later confirmed they had left without the journalists. \n \n Three Syrians, including a pregnant Syrian woman, her husband, and an elderly female patient, were moved to safety. \n \n Continue reading the main story At the scene The bombardment has started in Binnish, which for the past week has been under the control of the opposition. The Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Liberation Army are based in this town. We know that a government offensive has been taking place in the nearby city of Idlib. The townspeople have become increasingly concerned that the troops would then turn their attention to Binnish. That is what has happened this morning. We were woken to the sound of artillery bombardment. There is gunfire in the distance. We believe they are using anti-aircraft weapons against the town, and also setting up mortar positions. This is a town of about 40,000 people and although there are militiamen belonging to the Free Syrian Army and other groups, this has not been a military situation. From what we can tell, the bombardment is entirely random and is not targeting specific individuals. This seems to be part of a wider government offensive that is taking place in the north of the country, to regain control of opposition areas. \n \n Ms Bouvier suffered a broken leg and Mr Conroy was hit by shrapnel in the leg and stomach in an attack last Wednesday that claimed the lives of American Sunday Times journalist Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik. \n \n It had been hoped that the bodies of the two dead journalists would be brought out during the same mission, but this also failed. \n \n The BBC\'s Jim Muir reports from neighbouring Beirut that Ms Bouvier refused to board the Red Crescent vehicles, and the others stayed behind out of solidarity. \n \n Paul Conroy\'s wife said on Sunday that her husband had rejected an earlier opportunity to leave Homs with the Syrian Red Crescent as the photographer had been advised that they were ""not to be trusted"". \n \n And the UK\'s International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell told the BBC there was evidence of people on the ground ""infiltrating the Syrian Red Crescent"" and ""posing an additional danger"" to injured people seeking to leave Homs. \n \n Meanwhile, the LCC said 15 people had been killed in the Idlib area, nine in the Aleppo area, and several in the suburbs of Damascus. \n \n Several towns in Idlib came under army assault for the first time, reports said. \n \n BBC correspondent Ian Pannell, who is in northern Syria, says troops fired artillery, mortars and anti-aircraft guns at Binnish and other towns on Monday. \n \n Binnish has been under the control of the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Liberation Army for the past week. \n \n Our correspondent says the bombardment, which began in the early morning, appeared to be entirely random, hitting civilian areas rather than targeting rebel positions. \n \n The towns of Sarmin and Maarat al-Numan were also hit, reports said, along with the town of Qusayr, nine miles (15km) outside Homs. \n \n Weapons call \n \n As the crackdown intensified, the European Union imposed further sanctions on Syria. \n \n They include: \n \n a freeze on the European-held assets of the Syrian central bank \n \n travel bans on seven close associates of President Bashar al-Assad \n \n a ban on cargo flights from Syria into the EU \n \n restrictions on the trade in gold and precious metals \n \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the fresh sanctions. \n \n ""We will continue working closely with our EU partners to support the Arab League and its plan to end the violence in Syria and bring about a Syrian-led transition to a peaceful and more open political system,"" he said. \n \n Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. \n \n Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani said the international community should do ""whatever necessary"" to help the Syrian opposition, ""including giving them weapons to defend themselves"". \n \n ""I think they\'re right to defend themselves with weapons and I think we should help these people by all means,"" he added. \n \n Syrian state television has meanwhile announced the results of a referendum on a new constitution, which was dismissed by opposition activists and the West as a sham. \n \n The poll showed around 89% support for the proposal, the report said, on a turnout of just over 57%.', 'Are you there? Send us your images or video. \n \n (CNN) -- As the death toll from Syria\'s almost year-long uprising continues to climb, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem vowed to defend his country\'s ""independence."" \n \n ""We are not happy to see brothers killing each other. But this is our country. But we will defend our sovereignty and independence,"" he told reporters. \n \n The minister said no one is dying in Syria because of hunger or sickness and that despite the ""economic international boycott,"" his government is providing all necessary services. \n \n ""Do you think there is a government in this world ... (that cares) about Syrian people welfare more than the Syrian government? I don\'t see this logic,"" Moallem said. \n \n As day broke on Tuesday, four people were killed across Syria, opposition activists said. At least 144 people were reported killed Monday, including 64 who died in a ""horrifying massacre"" at a checkpoint in Homs province. \n \n Those killed at a checkpoint in the Abel area were attempting to flee shelling in the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. \n \n ""Reports said security members and thugs kidnapped the women among them,"" the network said in a statement. Residents found 47 corpses in one area and 17 in a second one, it said. \n \n A total of 68 corpses were found in the area, in farmland in western Homs province, said the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, apparently referencing the same incident. The bodies were found after an injured survivor reported the attack, the group said. All the bodies had been either shot or stabbed. \n \n In all, 104 people were killed Monday in Homs, an opposition stronghold, according to the LCC. They included four defected soldiers, three woman and three children. \n \n The deaths came on a day when Syrian officials announced that the nation\'s new draft constitution received approval and the European Union imposed new sanctions on the country amid ongoing clashes. \n \n The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said earlier explosions rocked Homs and shelling was occurring in Baba Amr. Twenty people were wounded when a large shell struck an anti-government gathering in Homs, the group said. \n \n Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar announced that 89.4% of voters approved the draft constitution, and 57.4% of eligible voters cast ballots. President Bashar al-Assad\'s regime has touted the constitutional referendum as a move toward reform. \n \n Syria announced the referendum amid intense international cries to stop the bloodshed and open its regime to change. But analysts and protesters widely describe the effort as a farce, a superficial attempt to pacify al-Assad\'s critics. \n \n ""We dismiss it as absolutely cynical. ... Essentially, what he\'s done here is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said of the referendum and al-Assad. \n \n She cited the ongoing violence in such cities as Homs and Hama and asked: ""How could you possibly have any kind of a democratic process in conditions like that?"" \n \n Aid efforts were under way in the midst of the violence. \n \n The Syrian Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross entered the province of Hama on Monday to provide aid to civilians, said Simon Schorno, spokesman for the Red Cross. A one-month supply of food, along with blankets and hygiene kits, were distributed to 12,000 people, he said. \n \n Beatrice Megevand-Roggo, the Red Cross\' head of operations for the Middle East, said a handful of aid workers were also able to go into Baba Amr. \n \n ""There were four ambulances that entered Baba Amr, belonging to the Syrian Red Crescent. They were loaded with medical goods. They indeed were not able to evacuate the two foreign journalists. I don\'t have the reasons why. They could evacuate an elderly woman, a pregnant woman with her husband,"" she said. \n \n The two journalists Megevand-Roggo was referencing were British photographer Paul Conroy and French reporter Edith Bouvier. Both were wounded in shelling. \n \n Red Cross spokesman Hicham Hassan said aid workers were also not able Monday to recover and evacuate the bodies of two journalists killed in Baba Amr last week. \n \n Marie Colvin, an American journalist who worked for London\'s Sunday Times, was killed in a shelling attack, along with French journalist Remi Ochlik. Colvin\'s mother, Rosemarie, said Sunday that aid workers have been trying for days to remove her daughter\'s body. \n \n CNN and other media outlets cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because Syria has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. But the vast majority of reports from the ground indicate that government forces are massacring citizens in an attempt to wipe out civilians seeking al-Assad\'s ouster. \n \n No attempts at getting al-Assad to stop his regime\'s crackdown on dissidents have stopped the onslaught. \n \n The Council of the European Union agreed Monday on new sanctions regarding Syria after foreign ministers met in Brussels, Belgium, said spokeswoman Susanne Kiefer. \n \n Seven ministers of the al-Assad regime will have their EU assets frozen and will be denied entry into the EU, Kiefer said. In addition, assets of the Syrian Central Bank in the EU will be frozen. Legitimate trade will be allowed to continue, she said, but must be authorized first. \n \n ""Today\'s decisions will put further pressure on those who are responsible for the ruthless campaign of repression in Syria,"" Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, said in a statement. ""The measures target the regime and its ability to conduct the appalling violence against civilians. As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep imposing sanctions."" \n \n Elsewhere in Syria on Monday, two people were killed and eight wounded by government shelling on the village of Sarmeen in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. \n \n The shelling began Sunday night, and Syrian troops have entered Sarmeen, said Abu Mustafa al-Sayed, a Syrian opposition and community leader in the town of Binnish, also in Idlib province. The Syrian army has Sarmeen surrounded, and communications with the residents have been cut off, he said. \n \n And in Damascus, security forces fired on mourners at a funeral, according to the Local Coordination Committees. Clashes were also occurring in Deir Ezzor, the group said, and 14 students were arrested during a protest at Aleppo University. \n \n The opposition network estimates that 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown in March. The Syrian government says that more than 2,000 members of its security forces have been killed by ""terrorists"" during that same period. \n \n Asked Monday whether Syria would be referred to the International Criminal Court, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said, ""I hope the international community reflects on the conditions of referral. ... It\'s a difficult issue. Syria is not a participating state, so it\'s up to the Security Council to address this question. They must therefore continue to gather the elements that would permit an eventual referral."" \n \n CNN\'s Jo Shelley, Per Nyberg, Salma Abdelaziz, Jack Maddox, Hamdi Alkshali and Kareem Khadder and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.', 'Image caption Paul Conroy was smuggled across the border into Lebanon and is said to be in good spirits. \n \n Injured British journalist Paul Conroy has been rescued from the Syrian city of Homs, but the whereabouts of French reporter Edith Bouvier remain unclear. \n \n French President Nicolas Sarkozy has withdrawn an earlier statement that she was also safely in Lebanon. \n \n The severely-injured Ms Bouvier is believed to have left Homs with Mr Conroy, but there are reports the rescue convoy was shelled. \n \n The UN meanwhile says more than 7,500 people have now died in the crackdown. \n \n UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said atrocities against civilians were being committed, and she had received reports that ""massive campaigns of arrests"" by Syrian troops against rebels had deprived many civilians of food, water and medical supplies. \n \n Her comments came at an emergency meeting of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, which renewed calls for a humanitarian ceasefire. \n \n Syria\'s representative to the UN, Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui, stormed out of the session, accusing countries of ""inciting sectarianism and providing arms"". \n \n Analysis The confusion surrounding the whereabouts of the wounded French reporter Edith Bouvier - and President Sarkozy\'s embarrassing admission that he had got it wrong in saying she had crossed safely into Lebanon - illustrate both the complications and the extreme dangers surrounding efforts to bring the trapped western journalists to safety. Necessarily, any attempt to extricate them has to be surrounded with secrecy, especially if it involves smuggling them across the Baba Amr battlefront and then the tense and dangerous terrain between Homs and the Lebanese border. From several accounts, the four journalists - Paul Conroy, Edith Bouvier, William Daniels and Javier Espinosa - came under shellfire as they were trying to escape, and the group got broken up. The one certain thing is that Paul Conroy managed to make it across the border, with the help of the activists guiding him. The Avaaz group, which played a role in the operation, said many activists died while escorting the journalists, who will clearly have their own dramatic story to tell. The whereabouts of the missing three journalists remains unclear, though some relatives and other sources believe they may still be trapped in Baba Amr under shellfire. \n \n Reports on Tuesday said Homs had come under some of its heaviest bombardment yet, with the government sending in units of an elite armoured division into rebel-held districts. \n \n President Sarkozy\'s statement on the campaign trail that Ms Bouvier had reached safety came after nearly 24 hours of confusion over the journalist\'s fate. He later withdrew the statement, describing the situation as unclear and complex. \n \n ""It has not been confirmed that she is in safety in Lebanon,"" he told journalists in Montpellier. ""Communications with Homs are very difficult."" \n \n The BBC\'s Jim Muir in Beirut says confusion remains over Ms Bouvier\'s location. \n \n Campaign group Avaaz said it had co-ordinated an operation to free the wounded journalists and two trapped colleagues, and some of the activists involved had died in the process. \n \n Avaaz executive director Ricken Patel said the rescue group had been split in two by shelling after leaving Homs, and only Mr Conroy\'s group had been able to move forward. \n \n Avaaz described the three other journalists - Ms Bouvier, Javier Espinosa from Spain and Frenchman William Daniels - as ""unaccounted for"". \n \n Mr Conroy was apparently able to walk across the border into Lebanon during the night, but our correspondent adds that the more seriously wounded Ms Bouvier would have had to be carried on a stretcher. \n \n Both journalists were hurt in the attack in which journalists Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik died. There has been no word on what has happened to their bodies. \n \n Mr Conroy\'s brother Alan said the family still did not know where he was. \n \n ""When we\'ve heard him on the phone or he turns up on the doorstep, then we\'ll be very happy,"" he said. ""He\'s a very strong character anyway. He\'ll cope."" \n \n \'War criminal\' \n \n In Washington, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that President Bashar al-Assad fits the definition of a war criminal. \n \n Campaign group Avaaz in Syria Says it co-ordinated rescue attempt of Paul Conroy, Edith Bouvier and two other journalists from Homs \n \n Has set up a network of citizen journalists and smuggled in foreign journalists \n \n Claims to have delivered more than $1.8m of medical equipment to the worst-hit areas \n \n Has helped collect and verify information on the scale of the crackdown on dissent \n \n She told a Senate hearing that an argument could be made for declaring the Syrian leader a war criminal. \n \n Mrs Clinton added that such an action would complicate the chances of finding a solution to the violence - and tended to make it harder to persuade a leader to stand down. \n \n As many as 125 people died across Syria on Monday, many of them in a single incident at a checkpoint in Homs, the activists\' network the LCC said. \n \n Sixty-five more were killed on Tuesday, it said. Death tolls remain very hard to verify as media access across the country is tightly restricted. \n \n The emergency session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) discussed a confidential report delivered by a UN panel of experts that lists Syrian army officers and government officials who could be investigated for crimes against humanity. \n \n French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has urged the 47 nations in the council to be prepared to submit a complaint against Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. \n \n ""The task of the council is to express the disgust of the entire world at the odious crimes that the Syrian state is committing against its people,"" he said. \n \n But the meeting is unlikely to bring about any change from the government in Damascus which is currently fighting for its survival, says the BBC\'s Jim Muir, in Beirut. \n \n It is more likely to put pressure on countries such as Russia and China, which have opposed any international action against Syria, he adds.']",3,"– At least 144 people were killed yesterday in the latest Syrian violence, including some 64 slaughtered in a ""horrifying massacre"" at a single checkpoint in Homs province, according to witnesses. But the government has no plans to end its attacks on citizens. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem vowed to ""defend"" his country. ""We are not happy to see brothers killing each other,"" he said. ""This is our country. But we will defend our sovereignty and independence,"" he told reporters. The scores killed at the checkpoint were attempting to flee shelling in the city of Homs. Security forces and thugs kidnapped the women among them, and killed the men, sources told CNN. They were either shot or stabbed to death. The killings occurred as Syrian officials announced that the nation's new draft constitution was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and the European Union imposed new sanctions. US officials dismiss the constitution vote ""as absolutely cynical,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. What Basahr al-Assad has done ""is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control."" In other Syrian news, the BBC earlier reported that French reporter Edith Bouvier refused to board a Red Cross vehicle that managed to enter besieged Baba Amr, and UK photographer Paul Conroy stayed behind in solidarity. But the BBC now reports that Conroy has indeed been smuggled out of the country; Bouvier's whereabouts are unknown."

"['OTTAWA -- Liberal MP Mauril Belanger is losing his own singing voice but that\'s not stopping him from trying -- for a second time -- to change the English lyrics to O Canada to make the national anthem more gender neutral. \n \n The veteran Ottawa MP, whose vocal cords have been weakened by Lou Gehrig\'s disease, is determined to end the song\'s inference that patriotism is something felt exclusively by men. \n \n Hence, soon after Parliament resumes work today, he intends to table a private member\'s bill that would alter two words, changing the second line of the anthem from true patriot love ""in all thy sons command"" to ""in all of us command."" \n \n Belanger introduced an identical bill in the last session of Parliament; it was defeated at second reading last April by a close vote of 144-127. \n \n At the time, MPs from all the opposition parties supported the change but almost all Conservative MPs voted against it. \n \n With the Liberals now in the majority, Belanger should have little trouble finally ensuring that women feel equally included in the national anthem. \n \n Passage of the bill would be a fitting legacy for Belanger, who was diagnosed just a month after the Oct. 19 federal election with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig\'s disease. It is an incurable, progressive, neurodegenerative disease that causes muscle weakness, paralysis and, eventually, respiratory failure. \n \n ""I remain committed to proposing this legislative initiative,"" Belanger said in a recent posting on his Facebook page. \n \n ""I intend to table my bill when the House of Commons resumes in late January 2016 and can expect to initiate the debate on the bill around April."" \n \n Belanger said the objective of the bill is to ""pay tribute to all the women who have worked and fought to build and shape the Canada that we know today ... to at long last honour their sacrifices and contributions."" \n \n O Canada was originally composed by Calixa Lavallee in 1880, with French lyrics by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. \n \n It took about 20 years for the song to surface in English Canada, where various versions of the lyrics were tried out. \n \n Belanger has noted that his proposed change would actually return the lyrics closer to one of the versions most widely used in the early 1900s: ""True patriot love thou dost in us command."" That line was changed to ""in all thy sons command"" at the time of the First World War, presumably to honour men in the armed forces, according to The Canadian Encyclopedia. \n \n The last time the English lyrics were changed was in 1980, when O Canada was officially adopted as the national anthem. At that time, repetitive phrases were replaced with ""From far and wide, O Canada"" and ""God keep our land, glorious and free."" \n \n Since then, there have been at least 10 attempts to change the second line to include women -- all of which have failed. \n \n Stephen Harper\'s Conservative government broached the idea in a 2010 throne speech, but abandoned it just two days later amid an angry backlash among core Tory party supporters. \n \n In a bid to persuade Conservatives that Canadians are not averse to modernizing the anthem, Belanger last spring commissioned his own poll which suggested almost 60 per cent favour his proposed wording. All but five Conservative MPs voted against his bill anyway.', 'Justin Trudeau’s newly elected Liberal government has been praised for overhauling Canada’s approach to immigration, the environment and relations with the First Nations. \n \n Now it is seeking to change the country’s national anthem – but just by four words. \n \n Liberal MP Mauril Bélanger introduced a bill on Wednesday to change two words of O Canada so it recognises the country’s women as well as its men. \n \n If passed, the third line of the anthem will change from “True patriot love in all thy sons command” – to “all of us command”. \n \n “With my bill, I want to pay tribute to all the women who have worked and fought to build and shape the Canada that we know today,” Bélanger said in a statement. “I want to at long last honour their sacrifices and contribution.” \n \n Bélanger, who was recently diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease and can no longer speak, introduced the bill using an iPad speech app. “By the way Mr Speaker, it is 2016,” he said in closing. \n \n Women’s groups have been trying to change O Canada ever since it replaced God Save the Queen as the country’s official anthem in 1980. Ten previous legislative attempts have all failed after opposition from conservatives who have variously called the move “grammatically unnecessary” or pointed out that most Canadian soldiers are male. \n \n In 2010 the change appeared in the government’s legislative programme at the time but was dropped after backlash despite support from prominent figures, including novelist Margaret Atwood. \n \n If the change goes ahead, it will actually be a return to the original English wording: the lyrics were only changed to focus on “sons” in 1914 as a show of support for soldiers fighting in the first world war. \n \n The French version of the anthem does not have a similar problem, instead focusing on how the country’s “brow is wreathed with a glorious garland of flowers”. \n \n Nancy Ruth, a Conservative senator, has long advocated a change. “For women, this will means we are included and valued for our labours in building this country. It means this for all Canadians,” she said. \n \n Beth Atcheson of the Sing All of Us campaign urged parliament to “make the very simple and straightforward change to address a historical anomaly and ensure a gender inclusive anthem before 2017, when Canada celebrates the 150th anniversary of its founding.” \n \n Canada is not the first country to seek to make its anthem more inclusive. In 2012, Austria changed its anthem to recognise its women, while last year Switzerland ran a contest seeking more modern lyrics for its national song. \n \n \n \n David Kendall, a Canadian anthem expert who runs the nationalanthems.info website, said he expected the bill to pass, thanks to the Liberal Party’s majority in parliament. “There’s a small number of people here who really want it changed and a small number who don’t,” he said. “But most don’t mind what it says as long as they get to sing it at the hockey.”', 'A renewed attempt to make the lyrics of O Canada more gender-neutral won\'t be supported by a newly elected Conservative MP in southwestern Ontario. \n \n Karen Vecchio, who became the MP for Elgin-Middlesex-London last October, said she will oppose Liberal MP Mauril Bélanger\'s second attempt to change some of the words in the national anthem. \n \n ""I think it just opens up a can of worms that we can look at each and every line of that national anthem,"" Vecchio said in an interview with CBC News. \n \n Tory MP Karen Vecchio says she will oppose Liberal MP Mauril Belanger\'s bid to change the lyrics of O Canada. (parl.gc.ca) \n \n ""We will be changing the entire national anthem into something that we don\'t even recognize,"" said Vecchio. \n \n In the previous Parliament, Bélanger put forth a private member\'s bill seeking to change the words ""in all thy sons command"" to ""in all of us command."" \n \n The bill was defeated at that time, but it was then supported by opposition MPs. The Liberals now have a majority government, which Bélanger is a part of. \n \n Earlier this week, Bélanger said he would reintroduce that bill this month. He did so on Wednesday afternoon. \n \n Vecchio said she views the anthem as a tradition that should be maintained. \n \n ""This is our national anthem, this is something that we\'ve had for decades,"" she said.']",3,"– A Canadian politician is on a crusade to change the lyrics of O Canada—the Canadian national anthem—to give equal shrift to both genders, the Guardian reports. The third line of O Canada currently reads ""True patriot love in all thy sons command."" A bill introduced by liberal member of parliament Mauril Bélanger this week would change that to ""in all of us command."" ""I want to pay tribute to all the women who have worked and fought to build and shape the Canada that we know today,” Bélanger says in a statement. “I want to at long last honor their sacrifices and contribution.” Who could oppose that? ""I think it just opens up a can of worms that we can look at each and every line of that national anthem,"" conservative member of parliament Karen Vecchio tells CBC. ""This is our national anthem, this is something that we've had for decades,"" Vecchio tells CBC. O Canada was composed in 1880 with French lyrics that didn't mention ""thy sons,"" the Toronto Sun reports. When English speakers finally started singing it around 1900, the most common lyrics were ""thou dost in us,"" highly similar to the proposed change. According to the Guardian, the lyrics weren't changed to ""thy sons"" until 1914. And other lyrics were changed to make them less repetitive when O Canada became the national anthem in 1980, the Sun reports. There have been 10 failed attempts to change ""thy sons"" since 1980. Bélanger himself introduced the same bill only to have it fail last April. But CBC reports it could fare better in Canada's new liberal government."

He was the second Wayne State officer to be shot while on duty. \n \n “I am saddened to report that a short time ago, Wayne State University Officer Collin Rose died from the gunshot wound he suffered while working in the line of duty yesterday evening,” Wayne State University President M. Roy Wilson said in a message to the campus community at 6 p.m. Wednesday. “This is a tragedy felt by all of us — Collin and his family and friends, his fiancée, and our campus and community. Please keep Collin and his fiancée and family in your thoughts and prayers. Collin served Wayne State with distinction, and we owe those he left behind our deepest sympathies and our strong support. \n \n ► Related: Echoes of the last Wayne State officer to be shot -- Thanksgiving 1977 \n \n ► Related: Wayne State suspect has history of assaulting cops \n \n ► Related: Suspect arrested, officer ID\'d in Wayne State police shooting \n \n “Please keep all our police officers in your thoughts as well. Collin is the first and only Wayne State officer ever to fall in the line of duty. Our officers mourn with us, but these dedicated, professional men and women continue to serve us courageously, every day. We can honor Collin’s memory best with our ongoing gratitude and support for all of our officers.” \n \n The 29-year-old police officer was shot in the head Tuesday evening while patrolling an area a few blocks off campus, near Martin Luther King Boulevard and Trumbull, in Detroit\'s Woodbridge neighborhood when he stopped to investigate a man. \n \n Rose was alone in the car with his two dogs. It\'s standard policy for officers to patrol alone, police said, It\'s also standard policy not to get the dogs — which are trained for narcotics and bomb sniffing — out and to use them to control a subject. \n \n It is unclear why Rose was in the area, which is off campus. Wayne State police are also sworn Detroit police officers and patrol the area around campus. \n \n Police have not said whether Rose was responding to a 911 call, which Lincoln Apartments manager, Betty Evans, said she made. She said she argued with a man on a bicycle, who didn\'t live there, and called 911 when he wouldn\'t leave the area. She looked outside as an officer arrived to confront the man on the bike. \n \n ""He was outside, in front. The officer was trying to get his hands behind his back. We heard a shot and the officer went down, and we heard two more shots,"" Evans said. \n \n ""I feel sorry for the officer. I hate the crime that\'s going on in the city."" \n \n There also had been a rash of car break-ins in the area the day before. Wayne State University police Chief Tony Holt said he didn\'t know how that factored into Rose\'s decision to stop the suspect. The suspect, who is not being named by the Free Press because he has not been formally charged, was arrested late Tuesday night. \n \n The suspect is known to the Wayne State police and other area departments. In 2011, he was charged with two counts of felony assault involving a police officer, one causing injury, and pleaded guilty, resulting in a 53-day jail sentence, records show. There also was an incident in 2014, Holt said, although he didn\'t have details of that. \n \n The shooting is hitting the 65-member police department hard, Wilson said at a Wednesday news conference. Many Wayne State officers, visibly shaken, gathered in the back at the news conference and exchanged long hugs with each other. \n \n Officials painted a picture of a dedicated officer when talking about Rose. \n \n He was a 2010 graduate of Ferris State University and was one credit short of completing his master\'s degree in police administration at Wayne State. His first job was with the Richland police department in western Michigan. \n \n “Collin is a 2010 FSU Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement Academy graduate,” Ferris State President David Eisler said in a statement. “We ask that you keep his family in your thoughts and prayers.” \n \n Gov. Rick Snyder\'s office issued a statement late Wednesday, saying Rose was committed to serving others. \n \n ""May he rest in peace knowing that Michiganders are collectively mourning his loss and that we will support his family, friends and colleagues to the best of our ability while they grieve,"" Sndyer said. \n \n Rose had worked and conducted training all over the state, Holt said. He was also heavily involved in organizing memorials for other slain police officers in the area. Members of many Detroit-area police departments showed up at the hospital following the shooting. \n \n People who live near the scene where Rose was shot said the suspect is a regular recipient of meals handed out three evenings per week from the I Am My Brother\'s Keeper Ministry about a block away. \n \n ""He\'d just eat his food and took off,"" said a man who identified himself as Angelo L. ""(He would) go outside, smoke a cigarette and just vanish. That was it, just like everybody else that comes down there to eat."" \n \n He said he\'d seen the man in the area regularly for the past five to six years. \n \n Angelo L. said he was familiar with Rose, who would regularly speak with and help people in the neighborhood, and that he feels ""very, very bad for him."" \n \n Annette Covington, who was sitting in a vehicle with Angelo L., lives near the scene and said the police broke down her door and raided the home, making a mess and tossing her TV and heater on her bed. She said they don\'t associate with the suspect, but that ""we feed and help everybody in this neighborhood."" \n \n A man who identified himself as Thad L. said the suspect had been homeless and living in a nearby park. He said he declined to give his full name because he was concerned people associated with the suspect would come after him. \n \n Contact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com.

(AP... (Associated Press) \n \n Security officials quickly pulled the man away as he tried to hide under Ferrera\'s voluminous gown before the Friday premiere of ""How to Train Your Dragon 2."" \n \n It was a bizarre incident on a red carpet renowned for its strict decorum. The man was later identified as Vitalii Sediuk, a Ukrainian prankster known for such stunts. \n \n Yet Ferrera didn\'t seem ruffled on the carpet and was in good spirits at the movie\'s after-party, laughing with guests and taking pictures. \n \n She declined comment on the incident, however, and festival organizers didn\'t immediately return messages about the matter. \n \n The former ""Ugly Betty"" star was on her way into the Palais des Festivals for the world premiere of the DreamWorks animated sequel.', 'The weirdest part of a story the New York Post just published about an incident on the red carpet at Cannes is not that it happened at all. Sadly, the news that a man tried to get under America Ferrera’s dress is not actually shocking in a media moment where paparazzi regularly take, and sell, crotch shots of female celebrities. It is that the Post is referring to the guy who did this, Ukranian Vitalii Sediuk, as a journalist, saying “a reputation for putting celebrities in comprising positions as part of his shtick.” \n \n A man dressed as Charlie Chaplin walks on the beach during the 67th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes on May 15. (REUTERS/Eric Gaillard) \n \n It is true that Sediuk’s career — or at least, his place in the headlines — mostly consists of sexually harassing celebrities, male and female alike. Just because some people think that Will Smith is gay and closeted does not mean that it is in any way reportage to try to plant a kiss on him at a movie premiere. And I have no idea what it is supposed to be when Sediuk puts his face on Bradley Cooper’s crotch on the red carpet. \n \n These are not only totally unrevealing stunts, if that is what they are supposed to be. They are assault. Just because they happen to men as well as well as women does not mean they should be treated as examples of puckishness or pranksterism. \n \n It is true that much of the time, Sediuk is crashing the events where he causes a scene. He apparently had a credentials pass in Cannes, though it is not yet clear if any organization actually granted it to him directly, or if Sediuk got his hands on someone else’s badge. When he tried to ruin Adele’s Grammy’s acceptance speech, it was just as a crasher. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences took steps to legally bar him from the 2013 ceremony. \n \n It is not particularly clear who Sediuk is working for at any given time. In 2012, he was affiliated with Russia Life News. In 2013, he was apparently presenting himself as a Eurovision correspondent. At other times, he has apparently worked for 1+1, based in Ukraine. That rotating roster of employers, or at least of assignments, seems in keeping with Sediuk’s actual professional seriousness. But it gets at a larger problem for entertainment journalism. \n \n It is a wonderful thing that there is a global market for American movies, and the global press attention for American actors that comes with it. That interest, coupled with the founding of a dizzying number of Web-based publications, creates both opportunities and dilemmas for American networks, studios, and entertainment festivals and conferences. \n \n This means that the entertainment industry can prioritize smaller friendly outlets, giving them opportunities and denying them to more established, and critical, organizations. It also means studios and networks have to pay more attention to foreign journalists who help ensure an ever-bigger part of their box office or advertising. These pressures are one of the reasons the Golden Globe Awards, the ceremony run by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, is such a big draw despite the often-odd choices made by its voting pool. The lines between reporting and stenography can get blurred, given these pressures — as can the lines between reporting and pranksterism. \n \n Big organizations like the Academy and the Grammys seem to have figured out that Sediuk, at least, is not a journalist, refusing him credentials and alerting security to his tactics, even if those briefings are not always successful. Outlets like the Post and the Hollywood Reporter, which has emerged as both buzzy and serious under the leadership of Janice Min, should make the same call, naming Sediuk for what he is. \n \n The entertainment industry and the journalists who cover it are not always going to be on the same page about who should get credentials and what constitutes reporting. Journalists, who have a range of assignments, will not always agree on these questions either. But I hope we can reach a basic consensus that Vitalii Sediuk does not deserve the title that still gets attached to him, and that harassing and assaulting stars may be vigorous, but it is not reporting.', 'The ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" actress was accosted by infamous prankster Vitalii Sediuk who stuck his head under her skirt at the premiere. \n \n CANNES -- American Ferrera\'s first appearance at the Cannes Film Festival was interrupted when infamous prankster Vitalii Sediuk rushed the carpet and stuck his head under her stunning white Georges Hobeika Couture gown. \n \n While walking the carpet for the premiere of DreamWorks\' How to Train Your Dragon 2, Ferrera didn\'t even realize at first what was happening.

(WANE) The Fort Wayne mother accused of killing her two children in the backseat of a stolen car in late September said she was spurred to action when she heard the Amber Alert issued to find her on the radio. “That’s when I went straight to Elkhart and that’s when I killed my kids,” said Pasztor. When asked why the Amber Alert was the impetus to smother her children Pasztor replied, “because I knew the police was gonna get us. And with me behind bars and my kids out here with all my problems; no. Sorry. No. I’m not that selfish. I’m not a coward.” \n \n Pasztor refused to offer details, but claimed she felt someone was going to harm her kids. She believed the only solution was to usher them on to heaven. She told NewsChannel 15 she didn’t have the heart to shoot them, so she smothered them. \n \n In an exclusive interview with NewsChannel 15’s Brett Thomas over video chat from the Elkhart County Jail on Monday, Amber Pasztor admitted to smothering her two children to death, one by one.

She said she dumped the gun in a Michigan river.', 'Amber Pasztor, the woman who killed her two children after abducting them from their grandparents house last Monday, was scheduled for a hearing the day she killed her children. \n \n WANE reports that Amber Pasztor was charged with criminal trespassing back in late July. On August 1, she was found guilty of the criminal trespassing charges and was sentenced to one year in jail. \n \n When Pasztor was able to get the sentence changed, she ended up spending no time in jail, and instead was ordered to stay away from the residence and complete 20 hours of community service. \n \n At the beginning of this month, Pasztor was said to be non-compliant with her sentence and was ordered back to court, which was scheduled for the day she kidnapped her two children, Liliana Hernandez and Rene Pasztor. \n \n Further, WANE revealed that shocking information has been found in regards to Liliana’s and Rene’s father, Rene Hernandez. Back in 2010, Rene Hernandez’s bisected body was located in a wooded area. According to the Whitley County Sheriff’s Office, the crime was never solved. \n \n The Whitley County Sheriff’s Office did say they spoke with Amber Pasztor after his body was discovered, and at the time she had one child with Hernandez and was pregnant with another, the same children allegedly abducted and killed by Amber just last week. \n \n Elkhart Co. coroner: Autopsies show Liliana Hernandez and Rene Pasztor died of asphyxiation, both ruled homicides. https://t.co/2j8OR7eCSA — Holly Hays (@hollyvhays) September 27, 2016 \n \n Whitley County Sheriff Marcus Gatton told reporters that Amber was never connected to Rene Hernandez’s death, but said it is likely they will be revisiting this case, Kokomo Tribune reports. \n \n “I’m sure we will be visiting her again.” \n \n Many are questioning whether Amber Pasztor is a female serial killer. When Amber abducted her children, she was with a neighbor, Frank Macomber, and was driving his car. \n \n Frank was reported missing that day and the amber alert went out for the children. Police eventually found Frank’s body the following day in a wooded area. Reports revealed that Frank had been shot to death. \n \n Investigators believe that the two cases are connected and say they think that Frank was killed before the children were kidnapped. \n \n Michelle Troye, Frank’s daughter, knew that something was very wrong when he went missing that day. She was convinced that not only would her father not be connected to the kidnapping, but that he was in grave danger. \n \n “I am 100 percent certain that he is not involved in this situation because he wouldn’t hurt anybody, especially children.” \n \n Frank and Amber had some sort of relationship and were neighbors, but the type of relationship between the two was unknown. Frank would sometimes help Amber, whether it was giving her cash or giving her rides. Troye was very non-accepting of her father’s relationship with Amber. \n \n “We were very persistent and telling him we do not want her around you, you do not need to have her around you, she is not right. He did not listen.” \n \n Troye kept hope that maybe her father would return home and be just fine, but all her hopes faded when she found out that the two children were found dead. \n \n “If those kids were alive, maybe she changed her mind about hurting anybody and there was still hope for my dad, but after hearing that, I lost all hope.” \n \n According to State Laws, there is no statute of limitation for murder in the state of Indiana. A murder case in the state of Indiana can be re-opened at any time, as many times as they feel necessary. Should they find it likely to re-open Rene Hernandez’s murder case, investigators have made it clear that they will likely be in contact with Amber Pasztor. \n \n Will Amber Pasztor be the next serial killer recognized in the state of Indiana? Only time will tell. Updates will be provided as they become available. \n \n [Featured Image by Bits and Splits/AP Images]', 'Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The discovery of two slain Indiana children, just hours after an Amber Alert was issued in their disappearance, was called a ""senseless tragedy"" by one of the prosecutors in the case.

She later drove a stolen car to the Elkhart Police Department, where she flagged down an officer and told him her children were dead in the back seat. \n \n She said she was in Michigan when she first heard the Amber Alert had been issued, she said in the interview. That\'s when she made the decision to kill her children. \n \n She told WANE she ""didn\'t have the heart"" to shoot them, so she smothered them instead. She previously revealed to Elkhart police how she used her hands to smother them, demonstrating how she covered their mouths and noses until they stopped breathing. \n \n They made the ""choice,"" she said, but still they fought back as she smothered them. \n \n The children died of asphyxiation, according to the Elkhart County coroner, and their deaths were ruled homicides. Pasztor faces two charges of murder. \n \n In the interview, she revealed how she pushed open the door of her father\'s home, took the children and started driving in the car she had stolen from her neighbor, Frank Macomber. \n \n Macomber, 65, was found fatally shot in a wooded area in Fort Wayne the day after Pasztor was arrested. She admitted to WANE that she also had killed him, but she has not been charged in connection with his death. \n \n Pasztor told WANE she had come up with the plan days before, when she planned to go camping and have sex with Macomber. She admitted to shooting him once with his own gun before stealing his car. She said she got rid of the gun in a river in Michigan. \n \n Pasztor told WANE she killed her children to keep them safe. \n \n “They were in good hands, but I don’t think they were safe,” she said. “My kids are in a better place ... they’re in heaven now.

She was in Michigan when she learned an Amber Alert had been issued for the children, and that was the point at which she decided to murder them, she says.

She says she smothered them because she couldn't bring herself to shoot them. She did, however, admit to shooting and killing her 66-year-old neighbor, Frank Macomber, the man whose car she allegedly stole and used to take her children. She has not yet been charged in his death, but is charged with two counts of murder for Rene and Liliana.

"['Ashake Banks said she opened a candy stand on the street of her North Austin block two weeks ago to keep kids close to their homes and maybe away from gang crossfire. \n \n \n \n Late Wednesday night, Banks\' 7-year-old daughter Heaven Sutton was sitting next to Banks as she sold snacks and snow cones when someone opened fire down the street around 10:45 p.m. A stray bullet hit the little girl as she ran back to her house in the 1700 block of North Luna Avenue, police and family say. \n \n Heaven was shot in the back and died half an hour later. \n \n \n \n ""I opened up the candy store for the kids so they wouldn\'t have to be pulled back and forth on the block because there\'s been so much shooting,"" Banks said this morning. ""I figured they (gang members) know us, they wouldn\'t come to the neighborhood and start shooting, but they really didn\'t even care. \n \n \n \n ""She looked forward every day to opening up the candy store, and for somebody just to come take her life, it\'s not right,"" Banks said. \n \n \n \n She said the block was filled with children playing when two men came out out a gangway and one of them started shooting at a group of people standing on the sidewalk near the candy stand. ""We\'re just sitting out here, normal, she\'s sitting next to me and I just heard shooting,"" Banks told WGN-TV. \n \n \n \n Banks said she threw herself to the ground while her daughter ran for the family\'s home. Moments later, Banks said she found her daughter unconscious inside a hallway. \n \n \n \n ""I\'m lost for words. That was my pride and joy,"" Banks said. The little girl had been looking forward to going to Disney World next month. ""She just got her hair done, she was going to Disney World."" \n \n \n \n A 19-year-old man, described by police as a gang member, was wounded in the ankle and taken to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, police said. The girl was pronounced dead there at 11:16 p.m., according to the Cook County medical examiner\'s office. \n \n \n \n Heaven is the 20th person under the age of 17 to be killed by gunfire in Chicago this year, according to a Tribune crime analysis. \n \n \n \n Police recently released statistics showing the number of Chicago Public School students shot this past school year -- 319 -- was the highest in four years. The toll from last weekend\'s gun violence in the city included the deaths of two boys, 13 and 14. \n \n \n \n The Austin community, which includes the North Austin neighborhood, has seen 16 homicides so far this year -- four in the last week. \n \n \n \n Banks said her daughter was frightened by all the violence around her home and had pleaded with her to move out. ""She would say, \'Mom, let\'s move.\' "" \n \n \n \n Banks had a message for the gangs in her neighborhood. ""You all cannot just get away with killing my baby,"" she said. ""You all took her life."" \n \n The slaying comes just days before state funding will run out for all five workers from the anti-violence group CeaseFire who mediate gang conflicts in Austin, according to the group. \n \n \n \n Rick Velasquez, whose outreach organization relies on CeaseFire, said even if Gov. Pat Quinn secures more funding at the last minute, the workers would still have to be temporarily laid off. \n \n \n \n “So how many murders are were going to wait until we get this thing moving?” said Velasquez, executive director of Youth Outreach Services. \n \n \n \n Earlier this week, the city for the first time approved funding for 40 CeaseFire workers to work in two police districts where shootings and homicides have risen: Grand Crossing on the South Side and Ogden on the West Side. \n \n \n \n Wednesday night’s shooting occurred in the Grand Central police district, which has seen significantly less gun violence than the other two districts. From January 1 through June 17 in Grand Central, there were 46 shootings compared to 56 during the same period in 2011, an 18 percent decrease, according to department statistics. Homicides were slightly up during that time, though: eight compared to five last year. \n \n Representatives of CeaseFire visited the Banks home Thursday morning. \n \n \n \n Longtime residents of the block say gang tensions have put residents on edge. Ron Ware, 61, said it was only a matter of time before a child or another innocent bystander was shot. \n \n \n \n Parents only let their children outside for short periods of time, he said, and then only with close supervision, he said. \n \n \n \n “I’ve seen a lot in my time, but it stuck in my head all night long – that baby holding her baby,” Ware said. “I couldn’t sleep.” \n \n \n \n Heaven’s aunt, Sharmaine Sykes, 28, said Heaven was a “girly girl” always eager to dress up in jewelry and high-heel shoes. \n \n \n \n But recent violence in the neighborhood started to make the happy-go-lucky child afraid, she said, and she had asked her mother to move out. \n \n \n \n “It hurts so much,” said another relative, Nisha Odell, 18, Heaven’s cousin. “I’m trying not to cry.” \n \n \n \n Odell said her younger cousin was joyful and made friends with everyone she met, young or old. “She’s the sweetest little girl you could think of,” Odell said. “She was playful. She talked to everybody. She kept a smile on everybody’s face.” \n \n William Lee and Jeremy Gorner are reporters for the Tribune, Jae Miller is a reporter for WGN-TV \n \n wlee@tribune.com \n \n Twitter: @MidNoirCowboy', 'ABC \n \n The latest number signifying how bad Chicago\'s violence has become is a small one: 7. \n \n That\'s how old Heaven Sutton was when she died Wednesday night of a gunshot to the back.

A stray bullet struck her as she ran to the safety of her home. \n \n ""She loved to sing, dance and crack jokes. And she always smiled,"" her mother, Ashake Banks, told ABC News. Banks had opened the stand to keep a closer watch on and protect children in her violent neighborhood on Chicago\'s west side. ""There was already shooting in the neighborhood,"" she said. ""So I figured that if I set up a big tent and a candy store, it would keep the kids in the middle of the block instead of going down to the [corners] where all the activity was."" \n \n Banks believes the shooter was a gang member targeting someone else in the crowd near the stand. She had hoped the gangs would stay away from a place meant for kids. ""But they really didn\'t even care…. They killed my baby."" \n \n Heaven\'s death is the latest of 253 murders so far this year in what has become a numbing drumbeat of violence. But her killing may be a crescendo. It prompted an angry Mayor Rahm Emanuel to lecture the gangs driving this staggering 38% increase in Chicago homicides. \n \n Asked about this shooting at an economic development event, the mayor said, ""This is not about crime. This is about values. Take your gang conflict away from a 7-year-old. Who raised you? You have a 7-year-old selling lemonade. You\'re a member of a gang coming to get lemonade and another gang member is driving by. Where were you raised and who raised you?"" His voice rising and pointing his finger, he continued sternly, ""Stay away from the kids!"" \n \n This emotional and personal approach is new for the mayor, who has focused on announcing various police and community tactics in previous comments on the spike in murders and shootings here. \n \n Another different approach came earlier this week when police gave the details of a $1 million partnership with CeaseFire, an organization that relies on ex-gang members to mediate conflicts and prevent violence. The controversial deal will put 40 ""interrupters"", as the group calls them, on the streets in two of the city\'s most violent neighborhoods. \n \n Ashake Banks welcomes any kind of help ""to stop the shooting."" \n \n She and Heaven were planning a trip to Disney World next month, a reward for the girl\'s good grades this year. Instead, Ashake now plans a march with neighbors tonight to send a message and a challenge: ""They cannot get away with just killing my baby. They shot her in the back and she was just seven years old.""']",2,"– The latest victim of Chicago's surge in gang violence is just seven years old.

Heaven, she says, had just had her hair done ahead of a family trip to Disney World to reward her for good grades.

"['Local woman warns of the dangers of breast implants \n \n A Shalimar woman has a warning for them. She says her implants nearly killed her. You may have seen some of the articles popping up on Facebook and various websites, linking mold in saline implants to a host of health problems. Anne Ziegenhorn says they are frighteningly accurate.If Ziegenhorn had known the price she\'d pay for beauty, she would have run the other way. She said, ""It\'s not a story a multi-billion dollar industry wants to get out.""Anne keeps a video on her phone of the saline breast implants covered with mold, that were removed from her body after a two-year nightmare. Ziegenhorn said, ""I felt like that was it, I was gonna die, and the doctors were gonna let me die.""It started in 2011. The woman who was a picture of health suddenly started gaining weight, losing her vision and experiencing burning, unrelenting pain. She had sores all over her body. Her thinking was so cloudy she thought she might have Alzheimer\'s. She was misdiagnosed with everything from lupus to arthritis to thyroid problems. She said, ""Silicone sickness in and of itself is one entity. And then you add the mold to it that we had, and then you\'ve got two illnesses going on.""The diagnosis that Anne believes saved her life came from Dr. Susan Kolb, author of ""The Naked Truth About Breast Implants."" Dr. Kolb said, ""My experience in doing this for thirty years is that eventually everybody will become ill from their breast implants, unless they die sooner from something else.""Dr. Kolb says she\'s seeing lots of women with mold in their saline implants, often from defective valves. She says some patients also have detoxification problems, that make them particularly sensitive to the silicone shells of the implants. She says in 25-30 percent of the population, the reactions are debilitating. The doctor is not anti-implants, she has them herself. But she believes for safety, women need to get their implants replaced every eight to fifteen years. Amanda Gilcrease is a patient who had her implants removed. She said, ""All the neurological symptoms... the burning, numbing, stabbing, shooting, electrical shocking pains throughout my body went away immediately.""Through Dr. Kolb, Anne Ziegenhorn met other women suffering the same frightening symptoms. They formed ""The Implant Truth Survivors Committee"" to educate women and doctors, and to force the FDA to listen. She said, ""I literally willed myself to live and willed myself to get this message out here This is my purpose, this is why I\'m here.""Channel 3 called the FDA to see if they\'re getting any reports of illnesses from mold in saline implants or from the silicone shells. Their spokesperson said he\'s not familiar with any such reports. The agency does say that most women will eventually need to have their implants replaced.

Both were diagnosed with Saline Biotoxin Illness, and received an explant from Dr. Susan Kolb. \n \n Paula Blades shared this picture of her back, riddled with scars. For years, she dealt with sores that would not heal. \n \n Many are willing to pay the price and go under the knife to fix their insecurities, including Paula Blades. She chose breast augmentation. Then, after years of severe mystery illnesses, it turns out the very thing she needed to feel good about herself was killing her. \n \n The Choice \n \n Down a quiet Gilbertsville road, you\'ll find Paula Blade\'s home. \n \n ""We live on a little farm. I love animals,"" Paula said. \n \n The lawn is manicured. Inside, her home is tastefully decorated, every detail thought out. Growing up, Paula had less control over her appearance. \n \n ""I actually had this little Skipper Barbie doll growing up, and you could twist her arm and her chest would expand,"" Paula said. ""So my cousins, they would try to, they would, like, try to twist my arm trying to get them to grow."" \n \n Paula laughs about it now, but the teasing harbored insecurities about her chest size. She was determined to have a breast augmentation. She even asked her parents for one when she graduated high school. They said no, but in 1992, at 20 years old, Paula was capable of making the decision on her own. She did her research and chose saline breast implants. \n \n ""Was told they were totally safe, would last me a lifetime,"" Paula said. ""If they did rupture, it\'s no big deal."" \n \n The implants had a valve, like many on the market. They are placed into the breast deflated, then a syringe is used to fill the implant with saline through the valve. \n \n Trouble With Her Health \n \n \n \n Even in the beginning, there was trouble. Two years after her surgery, she went back under the knife to fix the look of the implants. They looked wavy under her skin. \n \n It wasn\'t until years later that serious health problems began to plague her. \n \n ""I started getting like chronic sinusitis and different infections —bronchitis, things of that nature that wouldn\'t go away,"" Paula explained. ""I got these sores all over my upper torso that wouldn\'t heal."" \n \n ""Severe chronic sinusitis and running a temperature every day. My white blood cell count was increased,"" she recalled. \n \n Paula also lost a lot of weight, dropping to just 80 pounds. She went to doctor after doctor and faced diagnosis after diagnosis. She went through multiple hospital stays. \n \n ""Just one thing after another,"" Paula said. ""It seemed like it never ever was going to end."" \n \n No one could tell her the source of her illnesses, and she only got sicker. \n \n ""I was to the point where I was planning my funeral. I knew I was gonna\' die,"" Paula said. \n \n One night, Paula was channel surfing and happened to stop on Discover Health. The show \'Monsters Inside Me\' was on. Paula saw a woman. She was a stranger, but her symptoms were all too familiar to Paula. \n \n ""She was like me. She had the same symptoms, everything, and I was just like \'Oh my gosh, that\'s me,\'"" Paula said. \n \n Paula also saw Dr. Susan Kolb, with Plastikos Plastic Surgery Center in Atlanta, on the program. Paula reached out to her. \n \n ""The next week I was in Atlanta, met with her on a Wednesday,"" Paula said. ""She\'s like \'Honey, I know what\'s wrong with you.\'"" \n \n Getting Answers \n \n \n \n Kolb told Paula she had something called saline biotoxin illness. \n \n ""Most doctors have never heard of this disease, so they don\'t know anything about it,"" said Kolb. ""I think most doctors right now that are internal medicine, neurology, family practice and plastic surgery have patients in their practice that are diagnosed with you know, MS, lupus, other auto-immune diseases and fibromyalgia, that are curable.

In Paula\'s case, the procedure lasted hours, because it\'s not as simple as removing the implant. \n \n ""Specifically, you have to have the entire scar capsule removed. Not just the implant,"" Kolb said. \n \n The implants were then sent to Dr. Pierre Blais with Innoval Failure Analysis in Ottawa, Canada, for further testing. That testing found ""the valve capping mechanism...faulty"", the ""filling fluid grossly contaminated"" and indication of ""aspergilli-related entities,"" —mold. \n \n ""It can do all sorts of things in the body,"" said Kolb. \n \n Kolb also discovered silicone from the shell of her saline implant had leaked, collecting in certain areas of her body. \n \n Finding Support \n \n Anne Ziegenhorn and Paula talked with a British radio station about their stories the day we interviewed them.

Her health has improved, although she does have long-term neurological damage. She says she can accept that, because she\'s alive. \n \n ""Does it all look a little different to you now?"" I asked her of her life. \n \n ""Oh yeah. Yeah,"" Paula answered. ""Life\'s totally, my outlook on life\'s totally changed."" \n \n ""I\'m just happy to be here."" \n \n Paula and Anne have consulted with an attorney to see if there are legal options available to them.

If you live in a climate that is humid and moldy, you may be more susceptible to this condition. In that case, saline implants may not be the best option for you. \n \n As far as finances, Kolb says women need to make sure they are financially prepared to not only pay for the surgery, but upkeep on the implants. She told me silicone implants, for example, need to be changed out every eight years. Others can last longer.

Normally healthy, the mother of two soon began suffering from burning pain, vision loss, and cloudy thinking and had sores all over her body. She writes that she was unable to talk for 8 months, instead texting and writing on a dry-erase board. She saw many doctors, certain that their diagnoses of lupus, arthritis, and thyroid problems must be wrong. Then she saw Dr. Susan Kolb, author of The Naked Truth About Breast Implants, who has implants herself and who suggested mold might be an issue. Sure enough, as soon as Ziegenhorn's saline breast implants were removed, her symptoms vanished. Wear TV reports Ziegenhorn keeps a video on her phone that shows what was once in her body: a mold-covered implant. (She believes her implant was leaking ""moldy fluid"" into her system for years.) She and another woman from Kentucky, Paula Blade, have teamed up to spread the word, reports WPSD Local 6. Blade's tale is a similar one, and she says that when her removed implants were tested, the implants' valve was found to be faulty, the ""filling fluid [was] grossly contaminated,"" and there were signs of mold. Dr. Kolb believes the mold can often be traced to defective valves (saline implants are put into the body deflated, and the saline is then inserted via the valve). While an FDA spokesman tells Wear TV that he's not aware of similar complaints being filed by women with moldy implants, he does note that most women will eventually need theirs replaced. Dr. Kolb, however, says she's treated thousands of patients with ""saline biotoxin illness"" and feels strongly that patients should have them changed every eight to 15 years. (This celeb had her saline implants removed due in part to health concerns.)"
"['The electrochemical conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O into liquid fuel is ideal for high-density renewable energy storage and could provide an incentive for CO 2 capture. However, efficient electrocatalysts for reducing CO 2 and its derivatives into a desirable fuel1,2,3 are not available at present. Although many catalysts4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 can reduce CO 2 to carbon monoxide (CO), liquid fuel synthesis requires that CO is reduced further, using H 2 O as a H+ source. Copper (Cu) is the only known material with an appreciable CO electroreduction activity, but in bulk form its efficiency and selectivity for liquid fuel are far too low for practical use. In particular, H 2 O reduction to H 2 outcompetes CO reduction on Cu electrodes unless extreme overpotentials are applied, at which point gaseous hydrocarbons are the major CO reduction products12,13. Here we show that nanocrystalline Cu prepared from Cu 2 O (‘oxide-derived Cu’) produces multi-carbon oxygenates (ethanol, acetate and n-propanol) with up to 57% Faraday efficiency at modest potentials (–0.25 volts to –0.5 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in CO-saturated alkaline H 2 O. By comparison, when prepared by traditional vapour condensation, Cu nanoparticles with an average crystallite size similar to that of oxide-derived copper produce nearly exclusive H 2 (96% Faraday efficiency) under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate the ability to change the intrinsic catalytic properties of Cu for this notoriously difficult reaction by growing interconnected nanocrystallites from the constrained environment of an oxide lattice. The selectivity for oxygenates, with ethanol as the major product, demonstrates the feasibility of a two-step conversion of CO 2 to liquid fuel that could be powered by renewable electricity.', 'Scientists said on Wednesday they have developed a new way to make liquid ethanol efficiently without using corn or other crops needed in the conventional method for producing the biofuel. \n \n The scientists said their process turns carbon monoxide gas into liquid ethanol with the help of an electrode made of a form of copper. They said the new technique may be more environmentally friendly and efficient than the current method. \n \n Critics say that growing crops for biofuels is energy-intensive and takes up vast tracts of nonagricultural land, using too much water and fertilizer. They also say diverting corn and sugar to make biofuels pushes up food prices. \n \n The United States leads the world in ethanol production, with 13.3 billion gallons in 2013, followed by Brazil\'s 6.3 billion gallons, according to the Washington-based Renewable Fuels Association, which represents the U.S. ethanol industry. \n \n E85 ethanol fuel is pumped into a vehicle at a gas station in the town of Nevada, Iowa, on Dec. 6, 2007. Scientists say they have developed a new way to make liquid ethanol fuel in an efficient process that does not use corn or other crops. JASON REED / Reuters \n \n A group of scientists led by Stanford University chemist Matthew Kanan described the new method in research published in the journal Nature. Kanan said a prototype device could be ready in two to three years, enabling an assessment on whether the process can become commercially viable. \n \n ""I emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today. We haven\'t built a device,"" Kanan said. ""But it demonstrates the feasibility of using electricity that you could get from a renewable energy source to power fuel synthesis — in this case ethanol. There are some real advantages to doing that relative to using biomass to produce ethanol."" \n \n Ethanol fuel generally is produced at high-temperature fermentation facilities that chemically transform corn, sugarcane and other plants into liquid fuel. \n \n Kanan and his colleagues built an electrochemical cell — a device consisting of two electrodes that were put in water saturated with carbon monoxide gas. One of the electrodes was made of a material they call ""oxide-derived copper."" \n \n When voltage was applied across the electrodes, the carbon monoxide gas was converted into ethanol, they said. \n \n The researchers hope to take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it to carbon monoxide, which then would be fed into the copper-oxide catalyst. The researchers hope the catalytic cell would be powered by a renewable energy source such as solar or wind. \n \n — Reuters', 'Stanford scientists Matthew Kanan and Christina Li have created an oxide-derived copper catalyst that converts carbon monoxide to ethanol. The catalyst consists of a continuous network of copper nanocrystals with well-defined grain boundaries. The nanocrystalline network may be critical for producing ethanol, the scientists say. Credit: Matthew Kanan, Stanford University Stanford University scientists have found a new, highly efficient way to produce liquid ethanol from carbon monoxide gas. This promising discovery could provide an eco-friendly alternative to conventional ethanol production from corn and other crops, say the scientists. Their results are published in the April 9 advanced online edition of the journal Nature. \n \n ""We have discovered the first metal catalyst that can produce appreciable amounts of ethanol from carbon monoxide at room temperature and pressure – a notoriously difficult electrochemical reaction,"" said Matthew Kanan, an assistant professor of chemistry at Stanford and coauthor of the Nature study. \n \n Most ethanol today is produced at high-temperature fermentation facilities that chemically convert corn, sugarcane and other plants into liquid fuel. But growing crops for biofuel requires thousands of acres of land and vast quantities of fertilizer and water. In some parts of the United States, it takes more than 800 gallons of water to grow a bushel of corn, which, in turn, yields about 3 gallons of ethanol. \n \n The new technique developed by Kanan and Stanford graduate student Christina Li requires no fermentation and, if scaled up, could help address many of the land- and water-use issues surrounding ethanol production today. ""Our study demonstrates the feasibility of making ethanol by electrocatalysis,"" Kanan said. ""But we have a lot more work to do to make a device that is practical."" \n \n Novel electrodes \n \n Two years ago, Kanan and Li created a novel electrode made of a material they called oxide-derived copper. They used the term ""oxide-derived"" because the metallic electrode was produced from copper oxide. \n \n ""Conventional copper electrodes consist of individual nanoparticles that just sit on top of each other,"" Kanan said. ""Oxide-derived copper, on the other hand, is made of copper nanocrystals that are all linked together in a continuous network with well-defined grain boundaries. The process of transforming copper oxide into metallic copper creates the network of nanocrystals."" \n \n For the Nature study, Kanan and Li built an electrochemical cell – a device consisting of two electrodes placed in water saturated with carbon monoxide gas. When a voltage is applied across the electrodes of a conventional cell, a current flows and water is converted to oxygen gas at one electrode (the anode) and hydrogen gas at the other electrode (the cathode). The challenge was to find a cathode that would reduce carbon monoxide to ethanol instead of reducing water to hydrogen. \n \n ""Most materials are incapable of reducing carbon monoxide and exclusively react with water,"" Kanan said. ""Copper is the only exception, but conventional copper is very inefficient."" \n \n In the Nature experiment, Kanan and Li used a cathode made of oxide-derived copper. When a small voltage was applied, the results were dramatic. \n \n ""The oxide-derived copper produced ethanol and acetate with 57 percent faradaic efficiency,"" Kanan said. ""That means 57 percent of the electric current went into producing these two compounds from carbon monoxide. We\'re excited because this represents a more than 10-fold increase in efficiency over conventional copper catalysts. Our models suggest that the nanocrystalline network in the oxide-derived copper was critical for achieving these results."" \n \n Carbon neutral \n \n The Stanford team has begun looking for ways to create other fuels and improve the overall efficiency of the process. ""In this experiment, ethanol was the major product,"" Kanan said. ""Propanol would actually be a higher energy-density fuel than ethanol, but right now there is no efficient way to produce it."" \n \n In the experiment, Kanan and Li found that a slightly altered oxide-derived copper catalyst produced propanol with 10 percent efficiency. The team is working to improve the yield for propanol by further tuning the catalyst\'s structure. \n \n Ultimately, Kanan would like to see a scaled-up version of the catalytic cell powered by electricity from the sun, wind or other renewable resource. \n \n For the process to be carbon neutral, scientists will have to find a new way to make carbon monoxide from renewable energy instead of fossil fuel, the primary source today. Kanan envisions taking carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere to produce carbon monoxide, which, in turn, would be fed to a copper catalyst to make liquid fuel. The CO2 that is released into the atmosphere during fuel combustion would be re-used to make more carbon monoxide and more fuel – a closed-loop, emissions-free process. \n \n ""Technology already exists for converting CO2 to carbon monoxide, but the missing piece was the efficient conversion of carbon monoxide to a useful fuel that\'s liquid, easy to store and nontoxic,"" Kanan said. ""Prior to our study, there was a sense that no catalyst could efficiently reduce carbon monoxide to a liquid. We have a solution to this problem that\'s made of copper, which is cheap and abundant. We hope our results inspire other people to work on our system or develop a new catalyst that converts carbon monoxide to fuel."" \n \n Explore further: Newly discovered catalyst could lead to the low-cost production of clean methanol \n \n More information: Electroreduction of carbon monoxide to liquid fuel on oxide-derived nanocrystalline copper, Nature, dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13249', 'Today, nearly all ethanol fuel is made from corn or sugarcane, which requires vast tracts of land and huge quantities of water and fertilizer. Researchers at Stanford University have now developed an electrochemical process that could be far cheaper and better for the environment. \n \n The work is still experimental, but it’s significant because the group was able to synthesize ethanol and other desired products with so little energy input. “The levels of activity for CO reported here are unprecedented and a large step toward the realization of a practical system for converting CO to ethanol,” says Clifford Kubiak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. \n \n The scientists created a copper-based catalyst that is very effective at producing ethanol and other carbon compounds from carbon monoxide and water in a simple chemical reaction. They say the process, described in a paper published in Nature on Wednesday, could be powered by renewable sources of electricity, such as solar and wind, and would be an alternative to traditional biofuel production. \n \n Making ethanol is normally remarkably energy-intensive, involving gathering and treating biomass and then fermenting the sugar found in the plant matter. The Stanford paper shows it’s feasible to produce ethanol directly from water and waste gases using an electric current. \n \n “You get the same fuel, although in principle it could be much more efficient because you are not relying on biomass,” says Matthew Kanan, an associate professor of chemistry at Stanford who co-authored the paper. \n \n The researchers envision a two-step process in which carbon dioxide is first converted into carbon monoxide using either existing processes or more energy-efficient ones currently under development. Then the carbon monoxide would be converted to ethanol or other carbon-based compounds electrochemically. \n \n Existing methods for turning carbon monoxide into fuel are complicated, requiring very large reactors and high pressures. An electrolyzer, which uses an electrical current to drive a chemical reaction, could make the required system much smaller, says Joel Rosenthal, an assistant professor at the University of Delaware. This could allow ethanol production to be miniaturized and distributed. \n \n One could image, for example, having a rooftop solar panel produce liquid fuel stored in a tank the size of a water heater. “The big value of chemical fuels in general, and liquid fuels in particular, is that they have much, much higher energy density than typical battery technologies, so you can store a lot more energy in a smaller amount of space,” Rosenthal says. \n \n Ib Chorkendorff, the director of the Catalysis for Sustainable Energy research center at the Technical University of Denmark, describes the work as “an important step towards the goal of finding an efficient route for storing electricity as chemical energy.” \n \n The key to the new catalyst is preparing the copper in a novel way that changes its molecular structure. Until now, copper catalysts produced a wide range of carbon-based compounds, rather than one desired product, and required a lot of energy. \n \n The Stanford group starts with copper metal and, by heating it in air, grows a layer of copper oxide on top. Then that surface layer is chemically converted back to metallic copper. In the process, the copper takes on a very different surface with more active area for it to act as a catalyst. \n \n It will take years to know whether a device based on this chemistry would be commercially viable. But if perfected, it could provide an economic incentive for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.']",4,"– Could ethanol someday essentially be produced out of thin air? A group of scientists has published research in Nature detailing a new method of making ethanol out of carbon monoxide gas, instead of corn or sugarcane, Reuters reports. Researchers saturated water with the gas, then zapped it with a novel device featuring two electrodes, one made of what they're calling ""oxide-derived copper,"" to convert it into fuel. ""I emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today,"" lead researcher Matthew Kanan says. He expects to have a prototype device ready in two to three years. The environmental implications are profound. Critics of ethanol say it drives up food prices and consumes loads of land and water. It can take more than 800 gallons of water to grow enough corn to make 3 gallons of ethanol, Phys.org points out. What's more, researchers envision a two-step process in which the carbon monoxide is derived from carbon dioxide in the air, providing an ""economic incentive"" for scrubbing carbon from the atmosphere, the MIT Technology Review reports. The new process could also work on a far smaller scale than biomass methods; the Review envisions rooftop solar panels generating fuel that's kept in water heater-sized tanks.

"['WASHINGTON — Two former staff members of a delegate to Congress from the U.S. Virgin Islands were indicted Thursday for allegedly circulating nude pictures and videos of her and her husband that authorities said were stolen from the delegate’s cell phone. \n \n Juan R. McCullum, a former staffer for the delegate, distributed photos of the couple on social media in July 2016, according to the federal indictment. McCullum also sent a text alerting another then-staffer, Dorene Browne-Louis, of what he had done, as well as sending her several of the pictures and videos, according to prosecutors. \n \n The federal indictment refers to the victim as only “Delegate S.P.” But Democrat Stacey Plaskett, a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives from the U.S. Virgin Islands, issued a statement Thursday evening thanking law enforcement and saying she was the victim of ""egregious acts."" \n \n ""Last year, my privacy was invaded, which was followed by an organized smear campaign and defamatory press reports concerning both me and my family,"" Plaskett said. ""I was informed today that preliminary arrests had been made of individuals who were involved in those illegal acts. I am deeply grateful to the Capitol Police and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for their thorough and in depth investigating the crimes committed against me, and those who I love."" \n \n Plaskett said in her statement that the investigation was continuing and she could not comment further. \n \n The case began when McCullum offered to assist his boss in repairing her iPhone in March last year, according to the indictment. She provided McCullum with the phone’s password and he took it to a Washington, D.C., Apple store. Authorities say the device contained the images and video that would later leak online. \n \n McCullum stopped working for Plaskett in June 2016, a month before the explicit images appeared online. \n \n Prosecutors allege McCullum created a Hotmail email account under a fake name and sent at least 11 messages containing the images to politicians, reporters and other people familiar with the delegate. He then created a Facebook account using the same bogus identity and uploaded the content, even “friending” the Plaskett\'s challengers in her upcoming primary contest. \n \n A forensic investigation by the authorities found Browne-Louis had deleted multiple texts and emails from McCullum revealing the phony accounts, according to the indictment. \n \n McCullum faces two counts of cyberstalking and Browne-Louis faces two counts of obstruction of justice. Browne-Louis has pleaded not guilty, while McCullum has yet to appear in court.', 'Last week on July 4 we commemorated the Declaration of Independence, the affirmative document outlining the ideals of equality and democracy and upheld as a model around the world. For a small group of Americans, this year is also a centennial milestone. It marks 100 years that the people of the Virgin Islands have been part of the United States and have the honor to be part of Fourth of July celebrations. What many Americans are unaware of is the great importance of July 3 to Virgin Islanders. \n \n July 3 marked the 169th anniversary of the United States Virgin Islands Emancipation Day. In 1848, 15 years before President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, enslaved Virgin Islanders under Danish rule organized and executed their own armed rebellion and won their freedom from chattel slavery. Those people of the Virgin Islands and Haiti executed the only successful violent overthrows by those enslaved in the Western Hemisphere. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Throughout this year, the islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John will commemorate the centennial of the United States’ purchase of the Virgin Islands. The U.S., in its costliest per-acre land purchase, paid $25 million in gold bullion for these islands with strategic military locations for protecting the Caribbean Basin and the Panama Canal. This sale, however, occurred without a vote by the native Virgin Islanders. \n \n Virgin Islanders then spent a decade as citizens without a country, and now, alongside fellow territorial residents, hold no electoral votes and have no voting representation in Congress. Disenfranchisement in territories was originally a temporary step on the path toward statehood, but it has become a means to maintain the doctrine established by the Plessy v. Ferguson-era Supreme Court of “separate and unequal” status for the overseas territories. A federal appeals court decision, the Obama administration brief in Tuaua v. United States in 2015 and Congress’s unwillingness to grant equal treatment requests made by territorial representatives all uphold that unequal status. \n \n As a consequence of this disparate treatment, the Virgin Islands does not receive the same proportion of support in federal dollars as do states for school funding, roads and healthcare. The federal government matches 14 cents to every dollar of territorial funds but 30 cents to every dollar of other state funds. \n \n In 1917, Virgin Islanders came to Washington to petition for not only citizenship, but also the responsibilities thereof, demanding to be included in the draft, committing our sons to defend this country. This tradition of patriotism continues today, with Virgin Islanders giving the ultimate sacrifice in military conflicts at three times the national average. These brave service members fight for a commander in chief they do not elect and protect the ideals of a nation that are not fully extended to them and their families. \n \n Our territorial status is eerily similar to the status of the original 13 colonies. The colonists we commemorate every year revolted and wrote the Declaration of Independence because they were controlled by a government in which they held no representation. Today, territorial residents face the same treatment. How can we herald the actions of our Founding Fathers while simultaneously depriving fellow Americans of the same rights those Founding Fathers fought so hard to achieve? Just as the colonists, we are subjected to the laws of an un-representational government. But just as the colonists, we will not stop fighting for the same representation that every other great American enjoys. A people who have made great contributions to this country — including Alexander Hamilton, Denmark Vessey, and Tim Duncan — still do not have equal citizenship. Democracy is not complete. \n \n Plaskett represents the United States Virgin Islands’ at-large district in the United States House of Representatives.

He used these social media accounts to encourage others to spread the images and videos around Plaskett’s congressional district, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. \n \n McCullum allegedly alerted Browne-Louis to his actions, who later deleted his text messages from her phone and gave “false, incomplete, and misleading statements” to law enforcement about her knowledge of McCullum’s actions. She is due to appear in federal court on July 19, while McCullum’s first appearance has yet to be scheduled. \n \n The allegations, if proved, would represent a shocking betrayal by the delegate’s own staff, and a turnabout from her initial suggestion that her political enemies had hacked her computer and distributed the files. \n \n “The theft and distribution of these personal images via the internet marks a new low in Virgin Islands politics,” she said at the time. “I am shocked and deeply saddened that someone would stoop to such a level as to invade my marriage and the love of my family in an attempt to besmirch me politically.” \n \n Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

"['If it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. That appears to be the attitude consumers have toward Keurig Green Mountain (NASDAQ:GMCR) and its effort to get people to upgrade to its 2.0 machine. \n \n GMCR reported fiscal Q1 results on May 6. All things considered, the quarter wasn\'t bad on the face of it. Sales up a bit, adjusted EPS up a bit, and even though GMCR missed estimates the results were still in the same league. \n \n The problem was exactly what I was concerned about in my previous GMCR article, Keurig Green Mountain\'s Results Are Worse - Maybe Much Worse - Than You Think, following the Q4 results. Q4 is obviously the best seasonal period for selling brewers (mostly as gifts) yet the quarter ended with an obscenely high unsold finished goods inventory of brewers. That didn\'t bode well for the seasonally inferior Q1. \n \n The overwhelming majority of sales are for pods as opposed to brewers, kind of like razor blades versus razors, but brewer sales and usage will ultimately lead the long term. Pods were up 7% while brewer sales plunged 23% due to bad sales ""below expectations"" of management for the new 2.0 Keurig brewer. \n \n GMCR specifically stated that ""high inventory levels at retail"" was to blame. Sometimes borrowing a page out of Peter Lynch\'s book and staking out retail stores pays off. I mentioned in my prior article that ""as I did my shopping and browsing I kept seeing fully stocked shelves of the machines with rarely anybody looking. It\'s not because the brewers aren\'t popular - they most certainly are - but feels like anybody who really wants one has one by now."" In short, Keurig 2.0 isn\'t the iPhone. There is no urgency from most consumers to upgrade. \n \n GMCR lowered guidance due to ""the impact of near-term challenges related to this complex product transition."" Pardon my bluntness but that sounds like a crock. The challenge is, in my opinion, that people are happy with the original and aren\'t interested for the most part in fixing what isn\'t broken. \n \n The conference call addressed concern about a misconception that the new machine only brews GMCR\'s brands. However, I don\'t think that\'s the only problem or there would have been better sales for the older unit instead of the huge decline. No doubt that some people did indeed upgrade this quarter so the new machine was likely a headwind that could only help yet it clearly wasn\'t enough. Something else is going on and I suspect it is GMCR being closer to market saturation for the brewers. \n \n Maybe the upcoming Kold system, which is a whole different story making a whole different type of drink, will get GMCR back in hyper-growth mode, but I see the general coffee brew continuing in deceleration mode for the foreseeable future. \n \n Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. \n \n The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \n \n It’s been called the “razor blade business model.” A company sells a product like a battery-operated razor blade handle at a relatively low price in order to sell a complementary consumable product later, like the astoundingly costly Gillette Power Fusion Proglide cartridge, $18 for four blades, which then get thrown away. \n \n But it could also be called the Keurig “K-Cup” business model. Once a consumer buys the coffee machine, the coffee drinker may spend as much as $50 to $60 per pound on the coffee contained in the K-Cups, considerably more than the cost of even Starbucks’s breakfast blend, which goes for about $11.95 per pound. \n \n Some years back, thousands of Keurig single-serve machine fans found a cheaper alternative, however — refillable, non-disposable K-cups, little plastic coffee grounds holders, which the company graciously sold under the brand of “My K-Cup.” \n \n Not only was it cheaper, but the coffee drinker had more choice, as “My K-Cup” could be filled with any brand of coffee off the shelf. \n \n But in August 2014, when Keurig introduced its “2.0” line of coffeemakers, it stopped making “My K-Cup” for it and made the machine incompatible with any K-cups already in existence, as well as with any unlicensed disposable K-cups made by other companies. \n \n It was $50 a pound and a trail of waste — or nothing. \n \n [K-cups inventor: ‘I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it’] \n \n That was two provocations, but two too much. The reaction was fast and furious, on sites such as Amazon, as well as on Keurig’s own social media sites. \n \n Rhonda Ungericht, among many others, vented on Keurig’s Facebook page: \n \n “My sister bought a new Keurig and did not know it only takes Keurig K-cups until her third call to Keurig. Now my brother-in-law cannot use the coffee I got him for Christmas. I bought him Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee which you do not carry. And I have the original Keurig but when it dies, I will never buy another Keurig product. This borders on the unethical forcing people to buy only the K-cups you make. And you owe me $50 for the coffee!” \n \n Keurig’s explanation was a model of what not to tell angry consumers. The company said the change was for the consumer’s own good. \n \n “The My K-Cup accessory and other reusable filters are not compatible with Keurig 2.0 Brewing Technology,” the company explained on Facebook, “because the brewer has no way of determining what beverage is being used or how much coffee is being added, and therefore cannot adjust to factors such as brew strength and amount of water, which could represent a safety concern…” \n \n [VIDEO: Coffee in America, by the numbers] \n \n Clever competitors moved quickly to fill the void, with ways to, in effect, hack into the Keurig technology. The Rogers Family Company’s “Freedom Clip” was sold patriotically as “Our Gift To You and Everyone …. Freedom Of Choice!” \n \n “We at Rogers Family Company® believe that your right to choose any option is imperative. That’s why we have developed this easily installed ‘Freedom Clip’ for Keurig 2.0® brewers. Just place the clip in your new brewer and it will see all k-cup type pods as ‘Authorized K-Cups®.’ This clip is our gift to you. Now go forth and brew with freedom.” \n \n \n \n Green Mountain Roasters President and CEO Brian Kelley, center left, and Senior Vice President Mark Wood cut the ribbon to open the company’s first Keurig retail store in Burlington, Mass., on Nov. 8, 2013.

Sales of brewers and accessories declined by 23 percent, the company reported. Its stock price fell 10 percent in after hours trading. \n \n With that, Keurig’s CEO did what he had to do. He capitulated Wednesday in a call with market analysts. \n \n “We heard loud and clear from consumers,” said Brian Kelley, “who really wanted the My K-Cup back. We want consumers to be able to bring any brand and bringing the My Cup back allows that. \n \n “My K-Cup was a terrific addition for the consumer. It wasn’t used a lot, but for the consumer it was a nice element to have if they were given coffee as a gift. . . . We took it away because My K-Cup” wasn’t going to work with our new system. \n \n “Quite honestly, we were wrong. We underestimated the passion the consumer had for this. We missed it. We shouldn’t have taken it away. We’re bringing it back.”']",3,"– ""Our top-line growth ... was below our expectations primarily due to the slower than expected transition to the Keurig 2.0 system,"" Keurig Green Mountain Inc. CEO Brian Kelley explained in an earnings call yesterday, per the Wall Street Journal. Seeking Alpha sees it as the anti-iPhone scenario: ""People are happy with the original and aren't interested for the most part in fixing what isn't broken."" But at the Washington Post, Fred Barbash lays out a different problem: the ""My K-Cup"" one. The coffee packaged into each K-Cup costs customers dearly: on a per pound basis, they spend up to $60, or roughly five times what they'd pay for a bag of Starbucks coffee. Enter the My K-Cup, a refillable option that freed consumers from the expense and brand limitations of Keurig's K-Cups. The problem? The K-Cups that worked in previous models (both those made by Keurig and its competitors) lack a special ink introduced for the 2.0. Those cups no longer work, and neither do My K-Cups; no new refillable option was introduced. The complaints came in short order. As a one-star Amazon review for the K550 2.0 puts it, ""If you want a machine that brews a good cup of coffee then this will work for you. If you want a machine that puts all sorts of restrictions on what type of k-cups you can use this is also the machine for you."" The Post reports the company's initial line of defense was that the move was born out of safety, as the machine wouldn't know how to properly brew a coffee Keurig didn't package. Other companies introduced hacks (one competitor mailed out a free override device), and yesterday, Kelley ""capitulated,"" as Barbash puts it, saying ""we heard loud and clear from consumers""; the My K-Cup will return. (Here's why the inventor of K-Cups doesn't use them.)"

"['No one liked the government shutdown, but apparently, it wasn’t without love. The kind of love that transpires when, say, you and your partner both don’t have to go to work. One week passes. Then two. You’re bored. You’re adults. You share a bed. \n \n And nine months later, there you are at a hospital that seems strangely overcrowded. \n \n “We keep getting asked, ‘What’s going on?’ ” said Sibley Memorial Hospital nurse Yulette Newman. “And we sit back and say, ‘Well, you’re in D.C. What was happening nine months ago?’ ” \n \n According to some local hospitals, one apparent aftereffect of the 16-day October furlough has made its way into maternity wards. At Sibley, for example, an average of 9.2 births occur daily. During the past month, that number has increased by three births, or 32.6 percent, per day. \n \n Newman, who has been a nurse in Sibley’s Family Centered Care Unit for eight years, is credited by her fellow nurses with predicting the so-called baby boom. On the 10th day of the shutdown, she posted a photo of an “Expected Date of Confinement Wheel” on Facebook. The circular calendar is used by obstetricians to predict when a baby will be born, based on the date of conception. \n \n Furlough babies? (Getty) \n \n The caption “Furlough babies????” earned Newman 16 likes, 22 comments and a little boost in hospital fame come June, when the number of births was on the rise. \n \n Nurses at Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, Md., were making the same jokes this month, when births in the first half of July increased from 265 in 2013 to 385 in 2014. \n \n There were 99 additional births at Virginia Hospital Center in the months of April, May and June, although spokeswoman Maryanne Boster acknowledged that birth rates have been rising at the hospital for a few years. \n \n The fruitful aftermath of shutdown boredom could also be seen in federal offices. Jessica Hernandez, a program analyst for the Food and Drug Administration, was one of three pregnant women in her 150-person office after the shutdown. She traced the conception of her daughter Gabrielle Nadine, who was born June 3, to her time off work, although she admits it was “all kind of hazy.” \n \n “It was definitely stressful not knowing when we would get paid, but I actually had a great time,” Hernandez said. “I got lunch with other feds, hung out with my mom, volunteered at my other daughter’s school, cleaned some closets and then just relaxed.” \n \n Her relaxation contributed to her better mood, she recalled, and her better mood contributed to her choice of activities when her husband came home from his sales consulting job. \n \n Carl Woog, a Pentagon employee whose wife recently gave birth to a baby boy, said they tracked her conception date back to just after the shutdown ended. Although Woog wasn’t furloughed, he and his wife “may have been celebrating congressional action,” he joked. \n \n Of course, with this raft of happy new arrivals come the baby-boom skeptics — those who say that any uptick in Beltway babies is purely coincidental. And there isn’t an increase everywhere. Nationwide, birth rates are still near historic lows. Communications departments at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital and Inova Fairfax Hospital balked at the post-shutdown baby-boom claim, saying they have seen no significant rise in births. \n \n Statisticians have also weighed in, noting that claims of baby booms have previously popped up in the news media after severe weather or events. A well-known 1970 study discredited a baby boom reported in the New York Times after the Great Blackout of 1965. \n \n But more recent work has shown tangible increases in fertility after the Oklahoma City bombing and after a string of hurricane advisories on the East Coast. \n \n Newman, the nurse at Sibley Hospital, says there will always be skeptics of the theories that she and many other maternity nurses believe in: that full moons, drops in barometric pressure and bad weather all can affect conception and birth rates. \n \n “But every time [something unusual happens], I think, nine months from now, here we go!” Newman said. “And sure enough, I’m usually right.” \n \n \n \n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the sex of one of the children mentioned. Carl Woog’s wife gave birth to a boy', '— For years, the weather has been a scapegoat for allegedly causing cabin-fever induced spikes in births, and now some in the Washington area are pointing to Congress to explain packed maternity wards at several local hospitals. \n \n This July, nine months after Congress failed to pass appropriations legislation _ shutting down much of the government and sending hundreds of thousands of federal workers home for more than two weeks _ some hospitals are reporting higher-than-average numbers of births. Skeptics say the coincidence is probably just another false “baby boom” claim, which have been made after hurricanes, snowstorms and even the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \n \n “Usually these stories are just romantic hypotheses with nothing to support them,” said Philip Morgan, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who’s the director of the Carolina Population Center. “A few hospitals will have extra babies, so if you go looking for evidence you can find it.” \n \n In 1970, statistician Richard Udry published an analysis of a supposed baby boom reported by The New York Times nine months after a blackout had hit the city in the fall of 1965. Examining the combined hospital statistics throughout the city compared with averages from several years prior, Udry found no evidence of a real rise in births. \n \n Still, even Udry knew that his evidence would hardly quell the excitement related to reports of such baby booms. \n \n “It is evidently pleasing to many people to fantasy that when people are trapped by some immobile event which deprives them of their usual activities, most will turn to copulation,” Udry wrote. \n \n UNC’s Morgan said such events were unlikely to affect the birthrate because they rarely had an effect on other factors, such as couples using contraception. However, he said some cases had been scientifically corroborated, including a rise in births in metropolitan Oklahoma City after the bombings in 1995 and a decrease following the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision in Southern states. \n \n “It’s possible, but I doubt it,” Morgan said. “If anything, the government shutdown would irritate people and make them rethink having a child.” \n \n While it would take years to compare this year’s births with the long-term trend to prove such a boom, the spike in births at at least one hospital has people excited. \n \n “It’s not actually a rumor, it’s real,” said Gary Stephenson, a spokesman for Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, who said the hospital had averaged three more births per day so far in July compared with the same period last year. In addition, the hospital had eight more babies this June than it did in June 2013. \n \n While Stephenson acknowledged that the increased rate wasn’t beyond the norm, he said similar past events, such as the debunked post-blackout boom in New York, seemed to give such anomalies credit. \n \n “When you see constituent bumps (in births) over time . . . I think it does cause one to think,” Stephenson said, adding that a nurse at Sibley had predicted the recent uptick. \n \n Not all hospitals said they had evidence of a baby boom, however. A spokeswoman for MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the district’s largest, said the maternity ward there hadn’t seen any recent anomalies in the number of births, which was actually down in recent weeks. \n \n Brian Williams, the anchor of “NBC Nightly News,” took the opportunity of the reported boom to offer some on-air humor. \n \n “How long until someone on television points out that during the shutdown the folks in Washington are apparently doing at home what Washington has been accused of doing to the American people?” Williams said last week. \n \n A similar case of an alleged baby boom made news last year, when some hospitals in New Jersey reported a surge in births nine months after Hurricane Sandy hit the region in October 2012. \n \n The phenomenon was also recently referenced in a Hyundai commercial that aired during the FIFA World Cup competition. The ad showed a packed maternity ward before flashing back nine months to victory celebrations in which a young couple lock eyes and begin kissing. \n \n The federal government shutdown, which occurred last Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, sent roughly 800,000 federal workers home during that period. In addition, more than 1 million employees were required to work without pay. Congress later restored pay for all the federal workers. \n \n Email: jmoritz@mcclatchydc.com; Twitter: @JCMoritzTU.']",2,"– As the nation's capital languished during October's 16-day government shutdown, a nurse in Washington, DC, made a Facebook prediction: “Furlough babies????"" Lo and behold nine months later, reps at Sibley Memorial Hospital, where the nurse works, say there’s been a nearly 33% increase in births over the last month, says the Washington Post, while two other area hospitals report similarly notable jumps. Anecdotal evidence seems to support the timeline, with one FDA analyst recalling the time around her new daughter’s conception as ""all kind of hazy,"" while a Pentagon worker cops to ""celebrating congressional action"" with his wife. Similar booms have been positively correlated with other major events—including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and a series of East Coast hurricane warnings, notes the Post. But not everyone’s convinced: At least three other DC-area hospitals tell the Post they haven’t seen any ""significant"" increase, and a sociologist who spoke with McClatchy DC says that seemingly burgeoning birth rates after such events are ""usually … just romantic hypotheses with nothing to support them.""

"['Northwestern football players win pivotal union case. \n \n Northwestern University football players on scholarship are employees of the school and therefore entitled to hold an election to decide whether to unionize, an official of the National Labor Relations Board ruled Wednesday. \n \n The stunning decision, coming after a push by former quarterback Kain Colter backed by organized labor, has the potential to shake up the world of big-time college sports. \n \n The National Collegiate Athletic Association and universities set the rules and cut the lucrative deals with TV networks and sponsors, exerting near total control over the activities of players known as ""student athletes."" But now those football players, at least at Northwestern, are employees too and may seek collective bargaining status, according to the 24-page ruling by Peter Sung Ohr, the regional director of the NLRB. \n \n Ohr\'s decision is ""revolutionary for college sports,"" said Robert McCormick, a professor emeritus at the Michigan State University College of Law who focuses on sports and labor law. \n \n Experts said the ruling could have wide impact beyond Northwestern\'s locker room, potentially influencing other players, schools, and state and federal agencies. For example, McCormick said that if college players demand compensation for injuries suffered during training or a game, Ohr\'s opinion could raise the question of whether they should be treated as employees under the state Workers\' Compensation Act. \n \n The decision also opens the door for athletes with scholarships at public universities to move more quickly to unionize because state labor boards, which govern public universities, usually follow labor law interpretations issued by the NLRB. \n \n There were many questions left unanswered, including whether a union vote among Northwestern players would succeed, but Ohr\'s decision is preliminary. Northwestern immediately said it will appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and experts anticipate the case ultimately could be heard by the Supreme Court. \n \n ""Northwestern believes strongly that our student-athletes are not employees, but students,"" Northwestern said in a statement. ""Unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns raised by student-athletes."" \n \n Northwestern\'s football players are the first in college sports to seek union representation. Behind the effort is the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, a union funded by Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker who has become an advocate for players\' rights. CAPA is backed by the United Steelworkers, which is covering the group\'s legal expenses. \n \n ""This is a huge step toward justice for college athletes,"" Huma said. \n \n He said the NCAA invented the term ""student-athletes"" 60 years ago in an attempt to prevent students from unionizing. Wednesday\'s decision, he said, asserts the rights of college athletes under labor law. \n \n The union has said it would seek to negotiate over health and safety issues and does not intend to push for ""pay-for-play"" wages, which are not allowed under regulations issued by the NCAA. \n \n Among its demands, CAPA is seeking financial coverage for former players with sports-related medical expenses, independent concussion experts to be placed on the sidelines during games and the creation of an educational trust fund to help former players graduate. \n \n It also wants players to receive compensation for commercial sponsorships, which it says is consistent with ""evolving"" NCAA regulations. \n \n In siding with the union, Ohr said the football players primarily have an economic relationship with the university, which controls and directs their daily activities and compensates them in the form of scholarships, which are worth about $76,000 per academic year if the player enrolls in summer classes. \n \n ""The record makes clear that the employer\'s scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school,"" Ohr wrote. \n \n Football players with scholarships, he said, ""fall squarely"" within in the labor law\'s definition of an employee. Ohr said those players spend many more hours on their football duties than on their studies. Furthermore, he said, the players are subject to special rules and policies that do not govern the general student population. \n \n For example, he said, freshmen and sophomore students on scholarships are required to live on campus. Upperclassmen, he added, can live off campus but are required to submit their lease for approval to their coach, Pat Fitzgerald. \n \n ""Even the players\' academic lives are controlled as evidenced by the fact that they are required to attend study hall if they fail to maintain a certain grade-point average (GPA) in their classes,"" Ohr wrote. \n \n Northwestern argued that the term ""student athlete"" is still appropriate. ""We believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students, not a separate activity.""', ""Northwestern football players qualify under federal law as employees of the university and, therefore, can legally form the nation's first college athletes' union, the National Labor Relations Board announced Wednesday. \n \n “We had both the facts and the law on our side,” Gary Kohlman, the attorney representing the players, said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg News. \n \n It's a stunning ruling, but hardly the final one on the matter. Northwestern has already announced plans to appeal the ruling by National Labor Relations Board regional director Peter Ohr to the full NLRB in Washington, D.C. After that, it probably will go through appellate courts and even the Supreme Court if necessary. \n \n Outgoing Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter was the driving force behind forming the College Athletes Players Assn., which would take the lead of organizing the players if a union is formed. The legal bills have been paid by the United Steelworkers union. \n \n CAPA attorneys have argued college football generates enormous amounts of profit on players' labor, which makes the players employees of the schools. CAPA said scholarships are the equivalent of payment, but not nearly enough. \n \n Northwestern attorneys countered student-athletes shouldn't be categorized with unionized workers such as truck drivers or factory employees. It said scholarships aren't payments, they are grants. \n \n The NCAA is facing increasing pressure, including multiple lawsuits, challenging its classification of athletes as amateurs. The focus of this particular case is for athletes to unionize at private schools because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Severe weather halts Monday practice at Masters \n \n Dogs or 'Cats?

(Associated Press) \n \n The decision by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board means it agrees football players at the Big Ten school qualify as employees under federal law and therefore can legally unionize. \n \n ""Based on the entire record in this case, I find that the Employer\'s football players who receive scholarships fall squarely within (federal labor law\'s) broad definition of \'employee,"" Peter Sung Ohr, the NLRB regional director, said in his 24-page decision. \n \n An employee is generally regarded by law as someone who receives compensation for a service and is under the direct control of managers. Players argued that their scholarships are compensation and coaches are their managers. \n \n The Evanston, Ill-based university argued college athletes, as students, don\'t fit in the same category as factory workers, truck drivers and other unionized workers. Immediately after the ruling, the school announced it plans to appeal to labor authorities in Washington, D.C. \n \n Alan Cubbage, Northwestern\'s vice president for university relations, said in a statement that while the school respects ""the NLRB process and the regional director\'s opinion, we disagree with it."" \n \n The specific goals of the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, which would take the lead in organizing the players, include guaranteeing coverage of sports-related medical expenses for current and former players, ensuring better procedures to reduce head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships. \n \n But critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could hurt college sports in numerous ways, including by raising the prospects of strikes by disgruntled players or lockouts by athletic departments. \n \n For now, the push is to unionize athletes at private schools, such as Northwestern, because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities. \n \n Outgoing Wildcats quarterback Kain Colter took a leading role in establishing CAPA. The United Steelworkers union has been footing the legal bills. \n \n Colter, whose eligibility has been exhausted and who has entered the NFL draft, said nearly all of the 85 scholarship players on the Wildcats roster backed the union bid, though only he expressed his support publicly. \n \n CAPA attorneys argued that college football is, for all practical purposes, a commercial enterprise that relies on players\' labor to generate billions of dollars in profits. That, they contend, makes the relationship of schools to players one of employers to employees. \n \n In its endeavor to have college football players be recognized as essential workers, CAPA likened scholarships to employment pay — too little pay from its point of view. Northwestern balked at that claim, describing scholarship as grants. \n \n The NCAA has been under increasing scrutiny over its amateurism rules and is fighting a class-action federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts, memorabilia sales and video games. Other lawsuits allege the NCAA failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries. \n \n NCAA President Mark Emmert has pushed for a $2,000-per-player stipend to help athletes defray some of expenses. Critics say that isn\'t nearly enough, considering players help bring in millions of dollars to their schools and conferences. \n \n During the NLRB\'s five days of hearings in February, Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald took the stand for union opponents, and his testimony sometimes was at odds with Colter\'s. \n \n Colter told the hearing that players\' performance on the field was more important to Northwestern than their in-class performance, saying, ""You fulfill the football requirement and, if you can, you fit in academics."" Asked why Northwestern gave him a scholarship of $75,000 a year, he responded: ""To play football. To perform an athletic service."" \n \n But Fitzgerald said he tells players academics come first, saying, ""We want them to be the best they can be ... to be a champion in life."" \n \n An attorney representing the university, Alex Barbour, noted Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for college football players in the nation, around 97 percent. Barbour insisted, ""Northwestern is not a football factory."" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Michael Tarm at https://twitter.com/mtarm']",3,"– Northwestern football players aren't just student-athletes—they're employees of the university who have the right to form a union, a federal official ruled today. How big of a deal is today's ruling by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board? ""The stunning decision has the potential to alter dramatically the world of big-time college sports,"" writes Alejandra Cancino in the Chicago Tribune. The AP's Michael Tarm uses similar language, calling it a ""stunning ruling that could revolutionize college sports."" But first things first: The school plans to appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and nothing is expected to change until that decision comes down. Even then, the case could wind up in the Supreme Court. Northwestern's team is the first to seek permission to unionize, and it''s getting help from a players' rights group called the College Athletes Players Association. CAPA, in turn, is getting support from the United Steelworkers union. CAPA's attorneys say that players generate so much money for schools that they are clearly employees, and that they're already getting paid, though not enough, in the form of scholarships. Northwestern's attorneys argued that there's a big distinction between college players and, say, truck drivers, and it called those scholarships not pay but ""grants,"" reports the LA Times. If the NLRB sanctions such unions, expect teams all over to follow suit.

District Court Judge Lou Olivera, who runs a special treatment court for troubled veterans in North Carolina, tells ABC 11 that while former Green Beret Sgt Joe Serna had to be held accountable for lying about a urine test, he worried about what effect a night alone in a cell might have on the vet, who served three tours of duty in Afghanistan and suffers from PTSD. ""When Joe first came to turn himself in, he was trembling,"" Olivera, a fellow vet who served in the Gulf War, tells the Fayetteville Observer. ""I decided that I'd spend the night serving with him."" The jailer brought in extra mats so that the judge could sleep on the floor of the one-bunk cell. Serna, who ended up in the treatment court after struggles with alcohol and a DWI charge, says he was amazed when he realized the judge was going to stay the night.

"[""The focus would be helping students become more intelligent science consumers by learning how scientific work is done: how ideas are developed and tested, what counts as strong or weak evidence, and how insights from many disciplines fit together into a coherent picture of the world. \n \n Leaders of the effort said that teachers may well wind up covering fewer subjects, but digging more deeply into the ones they do cover. In some cases, traditional classes like biology and chemistry may disappear entirely from high schools, replaced by courses that use a case-study method to teach science in a more holistic way. \n \n In many respects, the standards are meant to do for science what a separate set of guidelines known as the Common Core is supposed to do for English and mathematics: impose and raise standards, with a focus on critical thinking and primary investigation. To date, 45 states and Washington have adopted the Common Core standards. \n \n “This is a huge deal,” said David L. Evans, the executive director of the National Science Teachers Association. “We depend on science in so many aspects of our lives. There’s a strong feeling that we need to help people understand the nature of science itself, as an intellectual pursuit.” \n \n The climate and evolution standards are just two aspects of a set of guidelines containing hundreds of new ideas on how to teach science. But they have already drawn hostile commentary from conservative groups critical of mainstream scientific thinking. \n \n For instance, as the standards were being drafted, a group called Citizens for Objective Public Education, which lists officers in Florida and Kansas, distributed a nine-page letter attacking them. It warned that the standards ignored evidence against evolution, promoted “secular humanism,” and threatened to “take away the right of parents to direct the religious education of their children.” \n \n In many states, extensive scientific instruction does not begin until high school. The guidelines call for injecting far more science into the middle grades, with climate change being one among many topics. In high school, students would learn in more detail about the human role in generating emissions that are altering the planetary climate. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n While thousands of schools in the United States already teach climate change to some degree, they are usually doing it voluntarily, and often in environmental studies classes. In many more schools, the subject does not come up because students are not offered those specialized courses, and state guidelines typically do not require that the issue be raised in traditional biology or chemistry classes. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Inevitably, educators said, some states will do it better than others. \n \n The other states that helped draw up the guidelines were Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The organizations included the National Science Teachers Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council and Achieve, a nonprofit education group that helped develop the earlier common standards in mathematics and English. Financing was provided by private foundations, including the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Noyce Foundation and the Cisco Foundation, as well as DuPont. \n \n Outlining how the standards might change science classrooms, educators said they foresaw more use of real-world examples, like taking students to a farm or fish hatchery — perhaps repeatedly, over the course of years — to help them learn principles from biology, chemistry and physics. \n \n Educators want to introduce students to topics that can be made comprehensible only by drawing on the ideas and methods of many scientific disciplines, one of the reasons climate change and other large-scale environmental problems are seen as holding so much potential in the classroom. \n \n Some teachers are already ahead of the curve. \n \n Judith Luber-Narod, a high-school science teacher at the Abby Kelley Foster Charter Public School in Worcester, Mass., has incorporated climate change into her environmental studies classes, even though she teaches in a somewhat conservative area. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “I hesitated a little bit talking about something controversial,” she said. “But then I thought, how can you teach the environment without talking about it?” \n \n Her students, on the other hand, love topics some deem controversial, she said. She devised an experiment in which she set up two terrariums with thermometers and then increased the level of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, in one of them. \n \n The students watched as that terrarium got several degrees hotter than the other. \n \n “I say to them, ‘I’m here to show you the evidence,’ ” she said. “ ‘If you want to believe the evidence when we’re done, that’s up to you.’ ”"", 'American school children will for the first time receive extensive lessons on climate change following the adoption on Tuesday of new science education guidelines. \n \n However, the final standards were substantially weakened from earlier drafts. \n \n The final guidelines cut by about a third the amount of time devoted to a subject seen as critical to future generations. \n \n They are also less explicit than earlier drafts about the human role as a driver for climate change. ""It\'s buried at best,"" said Mark McCaffrey, policy director for the National Center for Science Education. \n \n The new science teaching standards will introduce climate change as a core aspect of science education for middle and high school students \n \n in up to 40 states – in many for the first time. \n \n The guidelines were unveiled at a time when climate change has become \n \n a flashpoint for conservative groups, similar to the teaching of evolution in classrooms \n \n The Next Generation Science Standards are not mandatory. But scientists and educational experts in 26 states helped to develop them, and they will for the first time bring a degree of cohesion to the teaching of climate change, said Frank Niepold, co-chair of the climate education group at the US Global Change Research Program, \n \n who was involved in the three-year effort. \n \n ""In the current situation the state standards are all over the map. \n \n It\'s a hodgepodge,"" he said. ""We are still in a situation where across \n \n the country basically in every state students can still graduate from \n \n high school and in some cases go through college without learning the \n \n basics."" \n \n The mission of the new standards was to prepare a new generation of \n \n Americans for college and adulthood, said Matt Krehbeil, a consultant \n \n to the process. \n \n ""The NGSS aim to prepare students to be better decision makers about \n \n scientific and technical issues and to apply science to their daily \n \n lives,"" he said in a statement. \n \n However, the standards appeared considerably shorter than draft versions that had circulated in recent months. Unlike earlier drafts, the final standards do not propose teaching climate change until children are in middle school and high school. \n \n Mario Molina, deputy director at the Alliance for Climate Education, said the experts drafting the guidelines had cut 35% from the sections devoted to climate change, in response to public comments. He did not believe it was political, but was response to a need to compress a great deal of material. \n \n However, he said teachers will now need additional materials and clarifications to teach climate change in detail. \n \n Earlier versions had proposed introducing some aspects of climate change as early as kindergarten. \n \n The standards are also much vaguer about the causes of climate change. An earlier version for primary school students had said explicitly that human activity was a driver of climate change. ""It\'s not as explicit in terms of the connection between human activities and climate change,"" Molina said. \n \n McCaffrey agreed. ""They talk about climate just in a very general way,"" he said. ""At the third grade level they are not explicit that they are talking about human activities."" \n \n McCaffrey said the lack of clarity could be an opening for teachers to teach their own opinions in place of science, or resort to DVDs and other materials being pushed into classrooms by conservative groups that deny the existence of climate change. \n \n ""It opens the door for teaching a phony controversy,"" he said. \n \n The new guidelines also offered far less time for teaching about the physics involved in the greenhouse effect. Such knowledge was critical to ensuring students understand that greenhouse gases cause climate change, and that such emissions must be cut to prevent the worst effects of climate change. \n \n ""We are not seeing the students need to understand the greenhouse effect,"" he said. ""It was in the earlier version a year ago."" \n \n A spokesman for the Next Generation Science Standards refused to comment on the new guidelines, and hung up on the phone when asked about climate change. \n \n The new standards were released at a time when conservative groups in America are making a strong push to limit teaching of established climate science or inject fringe ideas on climate change into the curriculum. \n \n Some 18 states have considered ""academic freedom acts"" that would allow teachers to depart from established science and deny the existence of climate change – including seven this year alone. \n \n In Britain, meanwhile, draft guidelines released last month cut climate change off the curriculum for children under the age of 14. \n \n But it was hoped that the broad support from states and the involvement of so many experts from the National Research Council the National Science Teachers Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, would defuse any political controversy attached to the teaching of climate change. \n \n ""Climate change is not a political issue and climate change is not a debate. It is science. It is strongly supported heavily research science, and our hope is that teachers will not see this as a political issue or a political debate,"" Molina said. \n \n He said the new standards will help guide teachers on teaching climate change. However, it was critical that science organisations offer support and resources to teachers who may not be as familiar with climate change as with other areas of science. \n \n ""There are existing materials out there – DVDS and stuff on YouTube and so forth – that are being used in classrooms to perpetuate confusion. A lot of teachers just don\'t have the background in science themselves. They may be hesitant and confused. That is why professional development is so vital,"" he said.']",2,"– For the first time since 1996, educators have released major national guidelines for science in schools. The big news this time: They include a call for climate change education, potentially beginning in middle school, the New York Times reports. They also strongly urge schools to teach evolution. The Next Generation Science Standards, as they're known, are the result of collaboration between educators and 26 states. Though states don't have to follow the rules, 26 are ""seriously considering"" them, the Times notes. ""In the current situation the state standards are all over the map. It's a hodgepodge,"" an expert involved says. ""We are still in a situation where across the country, basically in every state, students can still graduate from high school and in some cases go through college without learning the basics."" Still, the completed guidelines are watered down from earlier drafts, the Guardian notes. The amount of material devoted to climate change has been cut by a third, and the final draft isn't as clear on human involvement in climate change: ""It's buried at best,"" says an education leader."
"['DENVER (Reuters) - The lawyer for the family of slain child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey denounced a CBS documentary theorizing she was killed by her brother, Burke, as a “false and unprofessional television attack” and threatened to sue the network for libel. \n \n File photo of Patsy Ramsey and her husband, John Ramsey producing a picture of Jon-Benet Ramsey during a press conference in Atlanta where they released the results of an independent lie detector test, May 24, 2000. REUTERS/Stringer \n \n L. Lin Wood, an Atlanta attorney who said he had successfully other media outlets over similar accusations against Burke Ramsey, branded the program as a broadcast riddled with “lies, misrepresentations, distortions and omissions.” \n \n “I will be filing a lawsuit on behalf of Burke Ramsey,” Wood told Reuters in a telephone interview. “CBS’ false and unprofessional attacks on this young man are disgusting and revolting.” \n \n The network responded to Wood with a terse statement: “CBS stands by the broadcast and will do so in court.” \n \n The two-part, four-hour program aired amid a wave of media coverage surrounding the 20th anniversary of the JonBenet Ramsey case, one of the most sensational unsolved murders in the annals of American crime. \n \n The body of the blond, blue-eyed girl, who had been beaten and strangled, was found in the basement of her parents’ Boulder, Colorado, home on Dec. 26, 1996, hours after her parents reported the 6-year-old child missing and a ransom note left in the house. \n \n No one has been charged with her murder. A grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, but then-District Attorney Alex Hunter declined to file charges, citing a lack of evidence. \n \n In the conclusion of the CBS show that aired on Monday, a panel of experts said it was its opinion that Burke Ramsey, who was 9 at the time of the homicide, struck his sister in the head with a heavy object, perhaps not intending to kill her. \n \n The girl’s parents then staged a crime scene to make it appear that an intruder was the culprit, the group of law enforcement, forensic pathologists and other experts concluded. \n \n Wood called CBS “corporate profit mongers” who aired the program during the September “sweeps” for maximum ratings benefit. \n \n In a recent interview on the “Dr. Phil” talk show, Burke Ramsey, now 29, denied that he harmed his sister, and said he suspected a pedophile who stalked child beauty pageants was the killer. \n \n Wood said a written disclaimer that CBS aired with its show, saying the opinions “represent just some of a number of possible scenarios,” did not go far enough.', 'This month, two new TV documentary specials about the unsolved murder of JonBenét Ramsey have aired in anticipation of the 20th anniversary of the six-year-old\'s tragic and mysterious death on Christmas night, 1996. Viewers who hoped to learn conclusive proof of who killed the child beauty queen sometime after she was put to bed in her Boulder, Colorado, home were likely disappointed. Two decades later, and the debate over whether it was the Ramseys or an intruder rages on, with A&E and CBS taking startlingly different positions. \n \n Related \'The Case of: JonBenet Ramsey\' Pt. 2: Everything We Learned In conclusion of docuseries, CBS team suggests that Burke Ramsey is the killer – but stop short of formally accusing him \n \n Though each promised new exclusive details, both programs largely relied on the available evidence gathered during the investigation and interviews with members of law enforcement involved in the original case. As was the case in 1996 – and every year since – the interpretation of that evidence remains at the center of this unsolved crime. A&E\'s documentary, which maintained that the Ramseys were rightfully exonerated by DNA evidence in 2008, concluded that because the intruder theory was dismissed early on by Boulder police, there simply isn\'t enough evidence to name a suspect without a complete reinvestigation. \n \n A complete reinvestigation is what CBS\'s The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey promised, but the only thing they delivered was a witch hunt that culminated in naming Burke Ramsey, JonBenét\'s then nine-year-old brother, as her killer, and implicating John and Patsy Ramsey in a coverup. (Burke Ramsey, now 29, appeared on Dr. Phil last week in his first-ever public interview, and insisted that neither he, his father John nor his late-mother Patsy has anything to do with JonBenét\'s death.) \n \n Absent any new physical evidence or meaningful new witness statements, the fruits of this reinvestigation, led by former FBI agent and criminal profiler Jim Clemente and behavioral analyst Laura Richards, were almost entirely subjective, at times dangerously misleading and dependent on a flawed police investigation that will very likely never result in the killer being brought to justice. \n \n Here, three big ways CBS mislead viewers with their reinvestigation into JonBenét Ramsey\'s murder \n \n \n \n Confirmation bias, selective hearing and the misleading 911 call analysis \n \n The first step in Clemente and Richards\' reinvestigation was analyzing Patsy Ramsey\'s 911 call, specifically an inaudible portion at the very end when the phone clicked but did not disconnect. Because the operator did not hang up, the call continued to record, but no one has ever been able to conclusively decipher the extremely muffled, inaudible voices heard faintly in the background. \n \n But many have tried. One such example is the Aerospace Corporation, who in 1997, at the request of the Boulder Police Department, conducted a test of the 911 tape, but the results were never officially released. However, in 1998, the National Enquirer leaked the results, which were subsequently quoted in Larry Schiller\'s 1999 book, Perfect Murder, Perfect Town: The Uncensored Story of the JonBenét Murder and the Grand Jury\'s Search for the Final Truth, and former Boulder Police Detective Steve Thomas\'s book, JonBenét: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation, in 2000. \n \n Clemente and Richards made a vague reference to this analysis, but didn\'t disclose that it had been leaked and that they were aware of its conclusions, as any investigator in this case surely is. Instead, they claimed they were going to use ""more modern audio technology"" to figure out how many voices were on the tape and what they were saying. Sitting in a recording studio, the pair listened as the engineer fussed with levels and knobs. As Clemente and Richards began to ""figure out"" what was allegedly being said and who was allegedly saying it, subtitles popped up on screen in a flagrant attempt to convince the viewers that they, too, could hear it. There were three voices speaking, they claimed, and one of them was Burke Ramsey, whom Patsy and John told investigators was asleep in his room the morning they discovered JonBenét was missing. \n \n A cursory review of the Twitter reactions to this segment indicates that many viewers could not make out any of what Clemente and Richards claimed to hear. ""In the headphones it was incredibly clear,"" Clemente tweeted, the implication being that despite devoting substantial time to playing back the audio over and over again, viewers should just trust what Clemente and Richards said they heard. \n \n The problem is, at least as far as the 911 call analysis goes, Clemente and Richards lost credibility by failing to disclose that the leaked results from the Aerospace Corporation\'s analysis are word for word what they seemed shocked and awed to hear on the other end of those headphones. Here is what the Aerospace Corporation found in their analysis of that 911 call, according to a report in local newspaper the Daily Camera: ""Those sources say enhancement of the tape reveals Burke\'s voice in the background, asking his parents \'What did you find?\',"" the paper writes. ""John Ramsey allegedly can be heard shouting to Burke, \'We are not talking to you,\' and Patsy shouts \'Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus.\'"" \n \n This is what Clemente and Richards concluded, verbatim. It\'s not clear if and how their analysis is new or more advanced than what was done previously. Far more egregiously, not disclosing their knowledge of the conclusions of the Aerospace report misleads viewers about the purity of their own analysis by not addressing the significant risk of confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one\'s existing beliefs or theories – a factor in the vast majority of wrongful conviction cases. Witness identification, recall of memories, evidence collection and analysis and forensic testing can all result in misleading or false results if precautions are not taken to prevent it. At the very least, the risk that confirmation bias can lead to selective hearing should be considered when weighing the significance of Clemente and Richards\' analysis of Patsy Ramsey\'s 911 call. \n \n Instead, viewers were subjected to their herculean efforts to isolate, amplify and translate this supposed bit of muffled dialogue as if it was just as brand new to them. And then they presented their conclusions as proof that the Ramseys had lied, and used Burke\'s alleged presence as an excuse to add him to their suspect list. \n \n Karl Gehring/Getty \n \n Dismissing the DNA evidence entirely \n \n Some of the forensic scientists and experts Clemente and Richards assembled for their investigative team, including forensic pathologist Dr. Werner Spitz and forensic scientist Dr. Henry Lee, offered some interesting and credible assessments of the physical evidence. For example, Dr. Lee did a demonstration that showed how a blow from a flashlight found on the Ramseys\' kitchen counter could have caused JonBenét\'s skull fracture. And both Dr. Lee and Dr. Spitz disagreed with Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy\'s decision to exonerate the Ramseys in 2008 based on new DNA tests which revealed the presence of unidentified male DNA from a single source on both JonBenét\'s underwear and leggings. Dr. Lee explained how touch DNA is so easily transferred that it can show up on a brand new pair of underwear straight out of its sealed packaging, so his belief that the presence of unidentified male DNA on a little girl\'s underwear could have come from a factory worker was convincing. \n \n However, just because the DNA is not proof of an intruder or proof of the Ramseys\' innocence doesn\'t mean the touch DNA is completely useless either, as Dr. Lee claimed. Regardless of how CBS regards its investigation, this is still an unsolved murder, no one in the Ramsey family has been proven guilty in a court of law and the intruder theory has not been conclusively ruled out. The absence of proof is not proof of anything. \n \n While touch DNA is easily transferred, there are still scenarios in which a specific DNA match would be regarded as extremely suspicious and should be pursued further. What if the DNA suddenly matched a child molester who had never worked in a factory that manufactured little girls\' underwear and had no reason to have ever come into contact with JonBenét, her new underwear or any of her other belongings that the DNA might have transferred from? Touch DNA alone is not a reason to convict, but it shouldn\'t be ignored as an investigatory lead. Dr. Lee\'s bizarre conclusion essentially invalidated the usefulness of touch DNA in all criminal cases. \n \n Overselling linguistic forensics and behavioral analysis as conclusive \n \n Time and time again, Clemente, Richards, former FBI ""linguistic profiler"" James Fitzgerald and former FBI statement analyst Stan Burke, reached certain conclusions based on highly subjective analysis of the vocal inflections, body language, pronoun use, linguistic phrasing and human behavior exhibited by the Ramseys during the investigation. Everything from Patsy Ramsey referring to herself as ""the mother"" in the 911 call, to John Ramsey\'s decision to pick up his dead daughter\'s body, to the ""appropriateness"" of Burke Ramsey\'s response to her death was scrutinized through the lens of the investigators\' ""expertise."" \n \n The Case of never made it clear that these areas of forensic science and behavioral analysis are viewed by the courts with varying degrees of acceptability and reliability, and with very good reason. Human behavior and language is not one-size-fits-all, especially with the introduction of trauma. Jim Clemente voicing his opinion that Burke didn\'t respond or emote ""appropriately"" seems irresponsible, especially when presented as evidence of guilt. \n \n The admissibility of linguistic forensics and behavioral analysis testimony is subject to a set of standards that may limit its scope or forbid it entirely in a court of law. In criminal cases, these methods are more likely to be used to eliminate potential suspects – not presented as proof of someone\'s guilt. \n \n Alas, the social media response to The Case of has been flooded with comments about how Burke is ""weird"" and ""a total psychopath"" who is ""obviously guilty."" For Clemente and his team to stoke that mentality without any caveats has repercussions that go beyond this case. Human beings are naturally inclined towards relying on their emotions and intuition, so expert testimony and evidence that is informed by subjective assessments of what is and isn\'t normal behavior can be incredibly convincing. \n \n Moreover, Clemente and Richards presented themselves and their team of investigators as infallible, their expertise as inarguable and their opinions as indisputable facts. More than once, they made unproven, disputed or misleading statements without providing further evidence, like the claim that John Ramsey disappeared for an hour and a half the morning of the murder – in actuality, he was in his study and the Boulder police just didn\'t notice. They also rushed to disprove alternate theories. After one attempt to get through a replica model of the basement window, Clemente and Richards concluded there could not have been an intruder because the spider web in the corner was ""destroyed"" and the real spider web in the Ramseys basement window was undisturbed. \n \n Yet when laying out their theory for Burke Ramsey as the killer, these experts literally made up a story about Burke killing JonBenét (on accident or in anger, but probably unintentionally) by hitting her in the head with a flashlight because she took a piece of his pineapple. The proof? JonBenét had undigested pineapple in her stomach. Even if this theory had been proven back in 1996, at age nine, Burke would have been too young to be legally prosecuted in Colorado, and he certainly couldn\'t be held responsible for any horrendous cover-up instigated by his parents. To unleash a witch hunt on him now without rock solid proof of guilt is a cruel ratings ploy. \n \n CBS included a disclaimer at the end of their closing credits which acknowledged that the ""opinions and conclusions … about how [the crime] may have occurred represent just some of the a number of possible scenarios,"" and encouraged viewers to ""reach their own conclusions."" This bare minimum of legal cover may be just enough to protect CBS from John Ramsey\'s inevitable lawsuit – as his attorney Lin Wood has already suggested is in the works – but it likely went unnoticed by viewers. The repercussions of depending on such controversial evidence go beyond this case, as jury members (the majority of which are not educated in the law) are often asked to weigh similar evidence and testimony when deciding guilt or innocence. The Case of oversold the same flawed methodology that has manipulated juries and resulted in countless wrongful convictions, coupled it with cherry-picked evidence and an extreme case of tunnel vision in order to finger a nine-year-old for a 20-year-old cold murder. That\'s disturbing and irresponsible, no matter who killed JonBenét Ramsey. \n \n CBS investigators allege that it was Burke, JonBenét\'s older brother, who murdered her. Watch here.']",2,"– It was a ""false and unprofessional television attack"" full of ""lies, misrepresentations, distortions, and omissions."" That's how a lawyer for the family of JonBenet Ramsey sums up a ""disgusting and revolting"" CBS documentary and its panel's conclusion that Burke Ramsey likely killed his sister in a rage that was covered up by his parents, John and Patsy. ""I will be filing a lawsuit on behalf of Burke Ramsey,"" the lawyer tells Reuters. He isn't the only one taking issue with the airing, though CBS says it ""stands by the broadcast and will do so in court."" Rolling Stone calls it ""a witch hunt"" and ""cruel ratings ploy""; in its view the evidence was ""almost entirely subjective, at times dangerously misleading and dependent on a flawed police investigation."" The investigators ignored the fact that they reached the same conclusion about Patsy's 911 call—in which they say Burke is heard speaking to his parents—as investigators in 1997, instead presenting their findings as new information. They also focused on what is ""appropriate"" human behavior and language in examining the Ramsey family's actions after the murder, which is rarely allowed in court. A lawyer not involved in the case calls the re-investigation ""a complete travesty,"" per the New Zealand Herald. Investigators ""went into this with an agenda—and that was the killer had to be from the family,"" he says. ""The worldwide audience means it's given [Burke] a worse reputation than if he had actually been tried."" (Burke Ramsey says he's innocent.)"
"['Truthfully, if it hadn’t been my paying job as a critic to watch Fede Alvarez’s remake of “Evil Dead’’ all the way to the end, I probably would have headed for the exit door long before the point where somebody cuts off her own arm with an electric carving knife. \n \n Of course, then I’d have missed another character being severed lengthwise with a chain saw while some members of the audience hooted in approval. \n \n Gorehounds will have a field day with the plentiful mutilations, decapitations and other blood-drenched moments in the redo. \n \n It amazingly sports an R rating, though it’s far grislier than Sam Raimi’s 1981 original (which was initially released without a rating but acquired an NC-17 for a 1995 re-release). \n \n The effects are also far more realistic than there were in the bargain-basement original from 32 years ago. \n \n Which means that instead of spoofing the excesses of that era’s slasher films, they’re basically being offered up for the delectation of contemporary moviegoers. \n \n While there were a couple of squeamish walkouts, many young men and women at the promotional screening I attended seemed to enjoy watching victims being shot at with nail guns, whacked on the head with crowbars or cutting off a piece of their face with a jagged piece of glass. \n \n Besides gallons of blood, there’s no small amount of urine, as well as a scene where a woman is raped by a plant. \n \n Acting is sort of besides the point in a movie like this, which has the performers spouting deliberately ridiculous dialogue and constantly risking their lives in ways that no sane person would. \n \n The setting is a remote cabin the woods — conveniently cut off by a flash flood — where a heroin-addicted young woman (Jane Levy) has been brought to try to go cold turkey. \n \n When she starts having delusions and warning everyone they won’t live through the night, they have to wonder if it’s a symptom of withdrawal or because the most dweebish guy (Lou Taylor Pucci) has started reading incantations from a mysterious old book he found. \n \n Also along for the gory, gory night are the junkie’s long-estranged brother (Shiloh Fernandez) and a student nurse (Jessica Lucas) whose skill at suturing wounds with duct tape comes in handy. \n \n Though it tries — with a much too heavy hand — the new “Evil Dead’’ is far less humorous than its predecessor, which catapulted director Raimi and star Bruce Campbell (who produced this one) into long mainstream careers. \n \n Which is not to say this “Evil Dead’’ reboot won’t also beget sequels.', 'The rare remake that likely will be enjoyed most by diehard fans of its predecessor, “Evil Dead” often comes off as the cinematic equivalent of a cover-band concert tribute to a supergroup’s greatest hits — albeit with a lot more gore. First-time feature helmer Fede Alvarez’s blood-soaked reprise of Sam Raimi’s franchise-spawning low-budget shocker, “The Evil Dead,” boasts far better production values than the penny-pinching 1981 original and conceivably could delight genre fans who have never seen the first version or its previous remakes/sequels. But it’s bound to play best with those who catch Alvarez’s many wink-wink allusions to Raimi’s pic. \n \n Working from a script he co-wrote with Rodo Sayagues, Alvarez briskly sets up his recycling of Raimi’s horror premise — five friends visit a secluded cabin in the woods where all hell breaks loose — with an aptly portentous prologue and backstory-heavy opening scenes. But Alvarez goes Raimi one better, by actually offering a logical reason why the characters don’t immediately vamoose once supernatural manifestations begin. \n \n Mia (Jane Levy), a drug-addicted young woman trying to go cold turkey, is undergoing physically and psychologically agonizing withdrawal, and her companions — including prodigal brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and medically trained buddy Olivia (Jessica Lucas) — are loath to interrupt the recovery process. Besides, all those terrible things Mia claims to see are just hallucinations triggered by withdrawal, right? \n \n Wrong. \n \n Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), the academically inclined member of the group, finds in the cabin a mysterious Book of the Dead filled with horrific illustrations, mysterious symbols and ample warnings not to read aloud anything that appears in its ancient pages. Unfortunately, Eric does not heed those admonitions, awakening a familiar demon for a new generation of young victims. Mia is the first to be infected by the monstrously malignant and singularly foul-mouthed bogeyman, but it doesn’t stop there, inspiring her cabin mates to damage themselves and each other in creatively gory ways. \n \n Alvarez repeatedly references plot elements and specific shots from Raimi’s original pic. Taking his cue from the original, he makes especially effective use of lenser Aaron Morton’s swooping, swirling camera movements, which suggest the POV of a rampaging poltergeist. But Alvarez’s tone is completely different, as the helmer rarely attempts to emulate the self-mocking, over-the-top campiness that distinguished the original “Evil Dead” from so many other cheapie creepies of the 1980s. \n \n Actor Bruce Campbell (who’s onboard here as a producer) more or less established himself as a cult figure back in the day with his inspired overplaying of Ash, the astonishingly resilient protagonist of Raimi’s original. In Alvarez’s version, Fernandez’s David serves the equivalent role, but he’s deadly serious. \n \n Indeed, the only character who even gets to crack a joke is Pucci’s Eric. Asked if he’s certain that actions described in the Book of the Dead will rid them of the troublesome spirit, the frantic fellow replies, “Am I sure? Of course not! It’s not a science book!” \n \n Levy is believably beastly as the possessed Mia, and manages the heavy lifting when her character must handle some last-act heroics. Other members of the cast do what they can with thinly written parts. For instance, it’s not really Elizabeth Blackmore’s fault that her role as David’s g.f. is so ill-defined and unimportant that some may forget she’s in the pic until she starts to make lethal use of a nail gun. \n \n The bloody mayhem is so graphic and frequent throughout “Evil Dead,” one cannot help suspecting that alternate takes had to be shot to ensure an R rating. The emphasis on dismemberment and disfigurement should make this must-see entertainment for gorehounds, but could literally scare off auds accustomed to less explicit, PG-13 fare. \n \n Ultimately, the new “Evil Dead” will rely heavily on existing fans of this unlikely franchise to make a killing in theatrical and homevid release. Those who get the inside jokes should be easy to spot: They’ll be the ones laughing when the onscreen carnage erupts most furiously. \n \n Evil Dead \n \n Reviewed at SXSW Film Festival (Headliners), March 8, 2013.

Mia (Jane Levy) is trying to kick a drug habit cold turkey, with the others (Shiloh Fernandez, Jessica Lucas, Lou Taylor Pucci, and Elizabeth Blackmore) along for support. \n \n PHOTOS: Scenes from \'Evil Dead\' \n \n After discovering a mysterious book, bound in human skin, they unleash a demonic force that wants them all dead and pits them against one another. \n \n The new film is produced by Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell (writer-director, producer and star of the 1981 movie, respectively) and nimbly walks the fine line of tribute, update and doing its own thing. \n \n What this ""Evil Dead"" gets most right is its tone, paying homage yet staking its own territory; it\'s scary without being downbeat, fun without being too jokey. Levy in particular is perfectly in sync with Alvarez\'s mix of sincerity, snark and scares. \n \n Alvarez certainly seems to have relished the chance to splatter and spray his cast with all manner of goo. His aesthetic is a few shades lighter than the gloomy grunge of other recent horror reinventions, and he never loses sight of the black comedy lurking in the story\'s corners. \n \n But back to the goo. There is plenty of over-the-top gore, great gushing geysers of it. Yet one of the most squirm-inducing moments — apart from the notorious, still difficult-to-justify ""tree rape"" scene — isn\'t from a Grand Guignol spurt of blood, but rather a relatively minor cut as a machete blade slices across the top of a bent knee. \n \n It\'s a sensation one can actually relate to, as opposed to something like the gruesome slapstick of slipping on a shorn-off piece of someone else\'s face. \n \n Respectfully aware of its origins — including a wait-for-it tag after the end credits — ""Evil Dead"" is something of a forward-looking throwback. It\'s unlikely the movie will gain the same ardent following as Raimi\'s debut, but it offers enough good-time gore, goofiness, scares and screams to leave an audience feeling a certain elated exhaustion. \n \n mark.olsen@latimes.com \n \n \'Evil Dead\' \n \n MPAA rating: R for strong bloody violence and gore, some sexual content and language \n \n Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes \n \n Playing: In general release', 'The remake of “The Evil Dead,” Sam Raimi’s 1981 horror film about a cabin of cult curiosities, doesn’t have the original’s wooden performances, puffy clothes and hairdos or its amusingly crude special effects, but it does share its blood lust. Torrential and somewhat rust colored, the blood in the remake splish-splashes across the screen, spurts out of bodies, soaks into floors and falls from the sky like a biblical portent. If the rivers of red in Mr. Raimi’s movie flowed more like molasses than water, it’s because they were created with food dye and Karo syrup. \n \n The new “Evil Dead” has none of the first movie’s handmade charm or hilarity, intentional or otherwise. (It also lost its “The.”) The director, Fede Alvarez, approaches the creaky material with a surprisingly straight face and a fair amount of throat clearing. Unlike Mr. Raimi, who scarcely bothered with preliminaries, Mr. Alvarez sets the creepy mood with a sacrificial immolation and a basement strung with desiccated cats. When his five souls roll up to their cabin, he continues to keep his foot on the brake with some back story involving Mia (Jane Levy), her drug addiction and issues with her brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez.) \n \n Finally something wicked does come, racing and smashing through the surrounding forest, and Mr. Alvarez, making his feature directing debut, gets his gore on. Taking his cues as much from the Abstract Expressionists as from Mr. Raimi, Mr. Alvarez opens up the book of the dead (bound in human flesh and tied with barbed wire) and makes handy sport with an electric meat knife and a nail gun, among other convenient and preposterous household items. As the plot thickens and the viscera and limbs fly, his mood appreciably lightens, and at least one scene approaches the macabre comedy of the black knight scene in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.” \n \n “The Evil Dead” enjoys the reputation of a cult classic, but its more lasting significance is as a cheapie do-it-yourself production that achieved indie success. (New Line Cinema picked it up and squeezed it dry.) The movie made Mr. Raimi’s reputation and set him down a path that led to two “Dead” sequels and eventual blockbuster fame. His star, Bruce Campbell, a puckish presence with a chin as big as an Easter ham, can be seen on the USA Network show “Burn Notice” as well as in an eye-blink fast cameo here. It’s too early to tell if Mr. Alvarez will be able similarly to translate this movie into a lasting career, but one of his stars, Lou Taylor Pucci, deserves a boost.']",4,"– Perhaps unsurprisingly, the remake of 1981's gore-fest Evil Dead is a love-it-or-hate-it affair. The new version has fewer laughs and even more blood and guts than its predecessor, critics say: The new Evil Dead has ""none of the first movie’s handmade charm or hilarity, intentional or otherwise,"" writes Manohla Dargis in the New York Times, noting that the film, directed by Fede Alvarez, ""approaches the creaky material with a surprisingly straight face.""

"['WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans muscled a balanced-budget plan through the Senate early Friday, positioning Congress for months of battling President Barack Obama over the GOP\'s goals of slicing spending and dismantling his health care law. \n \n FILE - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., accompanied by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, in this March 24, 2015 file photo. Senators worked into... (Associated Press) \n \n Working into Friday\'s pre-dawn hours, senators approved the blueprint by a near party-line 52-46 vote, endorsing a measure that closely follows one the House passed Wednesday. Both budgets embody a conservative vision of shrinking projected federal deficits by more than $5 trillion over the coming decade, mostly by cutting health care and other benefit programs and without raising taxes. \n \n The Senate was beginning a spring recess after approving the measure, leaving Congress\' two GOP-run chambers to negotiate a compromise budget in mid-April. The legislation is a non-binding blueprint that does not require Obama\'s signature but lays the groundwork for future bills that seem destined for veto fights with the president. \n \n ""Republicans have shown that the Senate is under new management and delivering on the change and responsible government the American people expect,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \n \n Democrats viewed the document differently, saying it relied on gimmickry and touted the wrong priorities. \n \n ""The budget we passed today is irresponsible and fails to effectively invest in our future,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. \n \n The budget\'s solidly ideological tenor contrasted with a bipartisan bill the House overwhelmingly approved Thursday permanently blocking perennial cuts in physicians\' Medicare fees. It too will wait until April for final congressional approval by the Senate, with McConnell saying his chamber will handle it ""very quickly when we get back."" \n \n Though doctors face a 21 percent cut in Medicare fees April 1, the government can delay processing those payments until Congress\' return. The measure, which also provides money for health care programs for children and low-income people, would be partly financed with higher premiums for top-earning Medicare recipients. \n \n On the budget, only two Republicans voted no: Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, a pair of presidential hopefuls. Two other potential GOP presidential candidates, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, voted yes. \n \n All voting Democrats were opposed. \n \n The Senate completed its budget work after enduring one of its more painful traditions: A multi-hour ""vote-a-rama"" in which senators repeatedly debate and vote on a pile of non-binding amendments well past midnight. Senators offer the amendments because the votes can demonstrate support for a policy or be used to embarrass opponents in future campaigns. \n \n Those approved included one by Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, entitling married same-sex couples to Social Security and veterans\' spousal benefits. It got 11 GOP votes, including from several Republicans facing competitive re-elections next year. \n \n Also adopted was one by McConnell aimed at thwarting Obama administration efforts to reduce coal pollution. \n \n Congress\' GOP budgets both matched the spending plan that Obama presented last month when it comes to defense, proposing $612 billion for next year, a 4.5 percent boost over current levels. Some conservatives were unhappy because they wanted more of the extra military spending to be offset with savings from elsewhere in the budget. \n \n But mostly, the Republican blueprints diverge starkly from Obama\'s fiscal plan. \n \n While his leaves a projected deficit exceeding $600 billion 10 years from now, the Senate plan claims a surplus of $3 billion. \n \n Over the decade, Obama would raise $2 trillion in higher taxes from the wealthy, corporations and smokers while granting tax breaks to low-income and middle-class families. He would boost spending on domestic programs including road construction, preschools and community colleges and veterans. \n \n The Senate budget would cut $4.3 trillion from benefit programs over the next 10 years, including annulling Obama\'s health care law, a step the president would without doubt veto. \n \n Those savings would include $431 billion from Medicare, matching Obama\'s figure. The House budget would pare $148 billion from the health care program for the elderly and convert it into a voucher-like program for future beneficiaries, a step the Senate shunned. \n \n The Senate budget would cut $236 billion from the budgets of nondefense agencies. The House would go even further, slicing $759 billion.', 'The U.S. Capitol building is seen before President Barack Obama arrives to deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, January 20, 2015. \n \n WASHINGTON The Senate passed a Republican-authored budget plan early on Friday that seeks $5.1 trillion in domestic spending cuts over 10 years while boosting military funding. \n \n The 52-46 vote on the non-binding budget resolution put Congress on a path to complete its first full budget in six years. It came at the end of a marathon 18-hour session that saw approval of dozens of amendments ranging from Iran sanctions to carbon emissions and immigration policies. \n \n Two Republican senators who are running or considering running for president, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, voted against their party\'s budget plan, which is similar to one passed by House Republicans on Wednesday. \n \n In addition to aiming to eliminate deficits within 10 years, both documents seek to ease the path for a repeal or replacement of President Barack Obama\'s signature health care reform law. \n \n But differences between the two documents still need to be worked out and a combined budget passed next month by both chambers. Doing so would allow Republicans to invoke parliamentary rules to repeal ""Obamacare"" with a simple majority in the Senate rather than a tough-to-achieve 60 vote threshold. \n \n Under the convoluted U.S. spending process, the budgets do not become law, but influence government agency funding bills later in the year. They also showcase the fiscal vision for Republicans, who now control both Houses of Congress for the first time since 2006 and are eager to demonstrate their ability to govern. \n \n ""This balanced budget is an important first step to help Washington live within its means, just like hardworking families have to do every day,"" said Republican Senate Budget Chairman Mike Enzi. \n \n He added that once a final budget is passed lawmakers would begin to work to find alternate savings that would allow them to ease statutory budget caps on military and domestic programs. \n \n The Senate budget seeks to eliminate U.S. deficits by 2025 without raising taxes through deep cuts to social safety net programs, investments in transportation and education and other domestic programs. \n \n At the same time, it proposes to boost defense spending by adding about $38 billion to an off-budget war funding account, and offers core Pentagon budget increases in subsequent years. \n \n More than 50 non-binding amendments were considered on Thursday and Friday in an open ""vote-a-rama"" process that allowed senators to promote pet causes or try to force opposition members into votes that may be used in campaign ads. \n \n Republicans passed a symbolic roll-back of the Obama administration\'s carbon emissions rules for power plants, while a Democratic proposal to recognize climate change risks for the military won approval. \n \n Another Democratic amendment to let all Americans earn paid sick leave passed with a surprisingly strong 61 votes, with support from 14 Republicans. The Senate also voted unanimously to make it easier to reimpose sanctions if Iran violates any nuclear deal. \n \n (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Tom Heneghan)', 'Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n WASHINGTON — Around 8 p.m. Thursday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, called Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York into his office with news that would stun Washington the next morning: Mr. Reid planned to retire at the end of his term. \n \n Mr. Reid’s decision to contact Mr. Schumer first, before even President Obama, was another powerful reminder of what Senate Democrats have long known: Mr. Schumer — the flip-phone using, rumpled, relentless son of a Brooklyn exterminator — is the presumptive front-runner to lead the Senate Democrats when Mr. Reid is gone. \n \n In that moment, Mr. Schumer’s possibilities finally caught up with his ambition. \n \n Just hours after Mr. Reid announced his retirement, throwing the future of his caucus into flux, at least one thing was clear: The Democratic leader post that Mr. Schumer has long coveted is his to lose. \n \n Mr. Reid, demonstrating the steely will with which he has ruled his conference, worked aggressively to anoint Mr. Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat, as his successor shortly after beginning to tell people that he would not seek re-election, effectively edging out Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. Mr. Durbin later said that he, too, would back Mr. Schumer. \n \n “He will be elected to replace me in 22 months,” Mr. Reid told Nevada Public Radio. “I think one reason that will happen is because I want him to be my replacement.” \n \n Mr. Schumer spent most of the day calling lawmakers to lock down their support for his leadership bid, which he officially announced Friday afternoon, saying in statement, “I am honored and humbled to have the support of so many of my colleagues and look forward to our Senate Democratic caucus continuing to fight for the middle class.” \n \n After more than three decades in Congress, Mr. Schumer, 64, has a reputation nationally as an institutional presence in the baroque Senate chamber and the green rooms of the Sunday talk shows. But his potential ascent to the top Democratic post also represents a boon for New York, where Mr. Schumer cut his teeth with his rapacious attention to local issues, one Sunday morning news conference at a time. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n New York has never produced a leader of the Senate, and it has been more than a century since a New Yorker was speaker of the House. \n \n “New York is very fortunate that we will have someone with his abilities and talents to help our state,” said former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato, a Republican whom Mr. Schumer unseated in a contentious 1998 battle, but who now describes him as “a tiger” on Capitol Hill. “He will do exactly that — use that power and that clout.” \n \n Unlike the frequently endangered Mr. Reid — and the previous Democratic Senate leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota — Mr. Schumer, who was first elected to the House in 1980, has proved seemingly unbeatable on his home turf. He has not faced a competitive campaign since his first election to the Senate, as he has kept the state’s Democratic community united around him. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n That same indefatigable relationship building has also helped him in the Senate. Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer, who were once longtime roommates in Washington, have jockeyed for years behind the scenes, at times tensely, over who would replace Mr. Reid. Mr. Durbin plans to run again for the No. 2 position, and has Mr. Reid’s endorsement. \n \n Mr. Schumer, a master tactician and inveterate deal maker, ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2006, when Democrats retook control of the Senate, and again in 2008, when they increased their majority. Mr. Schumer also earned the respect and trust of more moderate Democrats, who view him as someone eager to get things done and often call him when they have a concern or problem. \n \n Shortly after the 2014 midterm elections, when Democrats lost their majority, some Democrats who had chafed under Mr. Reid’s leadership urged Mr. Schumer to challenge Mr. Reid for minority leader. But Mr. Schumer quickly quashed the plan, out of “loyalty and friendship” to Mr. Reid, said someone close to Mr. Schumer, speaking anonymously to discuss a sensitive topic. \n \n Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 4 Democrat, is also interested in remaining in her party’s leadership, though she is not actively campaigning for a specific post. \n \n While some progressive groups called for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to consider running, Democrats have mentioned Ms. Murray as the most likely senator to pose a possible challenge for Mr. Schumer. She ran the party’s Senate Campaign Committee in 2012, is well liked and respected by her colleagues, and has a natural base of support among her party’s 14 female members. \n \n Though the official vote is nearly two years away, after the 2016 elections, the Democratic leadership was eager for a smooth transition, and at least a tacit understanding of who will replace Mr. Reid. \n \n In New York, where Mr. Schumer’s prowess as a retail politician is often on display, his possible elevation was cause for instant celebration. \n \n “I don’t know when the last time was when we had someone in such a position,” said Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens, adding, “He’s going to be at the head of the table, and I think that’s something that we haven’t necessarily had.” \n \n In contrast with other prominent New York officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, Mr. Schumer has never become a divisive figure, focusing insistently on the state’s economic interests and local concerns, rather than on ideological crusades. \n \n Mr. Crowley said Mr. Schumer has attended nearly every meeting of the state’s delegation, both in Washington and back home. When Mr. Crowley sought a House leadership post in 2012, he said he sought advice from Mr. Schumer, who helped rally the delegation behind him. \n \n Mr. Schumer has continued to work the state’s circuit of local parades and association dinners even as he has climbed the ranks of national leadership, making frequent visits to upstate cities, including Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “When I get together with him, I can get through a list of 10 issues in 45 seconds,” said Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse. “Between talking fast and talking on two or three flip-phones at any one time, he’s always extraordinarily responsive.” \n \n New York City politicians called Mr. Schumer an omnipresent force, regularly seen riding his bike around the city and showing up at swearing-in ceremonies for all manner of state and local officeholders. \n \n “He’s everywhere in the state and has been for a long time now,” said State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a former aide to Mr. Schumer. \n \n Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, said he encountered Mr. Schumer last week at a Lunar New Year event, where the senator received an omen of good luck: In a traditional ceremony, featuring costumed dancers dressed as lions, scattering vegetables in the crowd, a piece of lettuce landed on New York’s senior senator. \n \n “When he caught a piece, he said: ‘I guess I have good fortune coming my way,’ ” Mr. Adams recalled. “He should thank that lion.”']",3,"– The Senate powered through an 18-hour session that ended at 3:28am this morning, giving a yea or nay to more than 50 amendments in a ""vote-a-rama"" marathon and, in a 52-46 vote, approving a budget that looks to pave the way for dumping ObamaCare, Reuters reports. Not one Democrat said yes to the plan, the New York Times reports. The GOP plan for purging deficits by 2025 without raising taxes: slash $5.1 trillion in social ""safety net"" and other programs. What's going to rise amid the deep cuts is military funding, with a proposal to funnel about $38 billion over to a war-funding account. The Senate now begins a spring recess, so come mid-April, the approved Senate budget will need to be reconciled with the House budget that passed Wednesday. The Times notes it would be ""the first common congressional budget in a decade."" While not legally binding or in need of Obama's signature, the legislation informs spending limits for domestic and military programs, per the Times, and lays the groundwork for future bills that seem destined for veto fights with the president, the AP notes. ""Fortunately for the country, the Republican budget will not become law,"" Harry Reid tells the Times. Two GOPers voted ""nay"" to the plan: presidential wannabes Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. As for the dozens of amendments that flew through the approval process, there were some conciliatory overtures from the Republican side: They helped sail through amendments on Social Security and veteran benefits for same-sex couples, and 14 GOPers voted to pass an amendment that calls for American workers to earn paid sick leave, Reuters notes."

He had previously been fired from Twitter after he was determined to be a ""bad manager."" Female employees claimed his behavior made them uncomfortable, however, no sexual harassment claims were ever filed. \n \n HQ Trivia was having problems recently. It was steadily losing audience. In January, HQ was in the top 10 list of most downloaded iPhone games. It\'s now fluctuating between #250 and 500 in the U.S. Also, Kroll was dealing with an H.R. complaint by an HQ employee for his ""aggressive management style."" \n \n Kroll was also the co-founder of Vine and was General Manager between 2013 and 2014. And, he was the Chief Technology Officer for Jetsetter. Prior to that, Kroll served as the Engineering Manager at Yahoo between 2007 to 2009. \n \n Kroll was 34. \n \n RIP', 'HQ could use another win. \n \n The company behind HQ Trivia, the once-viral game-show app created by the same guys who invented Vine, is facing a pivotal moment. \n \n HQ is preparing to launch a new game show, one that it hopes will legitimize its place as a rising player in the world of mobile entertainment. But it’s also dealing with some serious issues, including a declining audience for HQ Trivia and the aftermath of a dramatic change of CEOs. \n \n Publicly, it’s clear that HQ Trivia’s viral ride is over. The app, where users can win cash prizes for correctly answering trivia questions presented live by a wacky host, captured the internet’s attention late last year. Some saw it as the future of media, and HQ Trivia spent much of January and February in the Top 10 list of most-downloaded free iPhone games. It’s now fluctuating between No. 250 and No. 500 on that list in the U.S. The audiences it pulls for its trivia shows, while still in the hundreds of thousands, are a fraction of what they were earlier this year. \n \n Privately, HQ is going through different growing pains. The company recently forced out its CEO, replacing one co-founder with another following a contentious boardroom battle between the two, Recode has learned. \n \n Adding to the drama is the fact that an HQ employee filed a formal complaint to HR in August against new CEO Colin Kroll for his aggressive management style, according to multiple sources. The alleged behavior was not sexual, these sources said, but was elevated to HQ’s board of directors. \n \n HQ’s board was made aware of the complaint before Kroll was appointed CEO, but felt comfortable promoting him after an outside investigator looked into the alleged behavior. \n \n Recode reached out to HQ and Kroll with our reporting. A company spokesperson sent the following statement: \n \n A complaint was filed during the course of the leadership transition. We initiated an external investigation through a 3rd party to vet the complaint, and that investigation yielded no concerns. We take pride in our company culture and strive to create an environment where everyone feels safe, respected and valued. \n \n It’s been a lot of drama for a young company, and all of it comes at an important time. HQ recently announced its second game show, a “Wheel of Fortune”-style game for smartphones called “Words,” and many close to the company believe this new game needs to be a hit. \n \n HQ expects to do more than $10 million in revenue this year, according to sources, but has also taken millions in venture funding and has a $100 million valuation. The belief is that HQ can’t survive on one trivia show alone — not if it wants to become a legitimate media business and live up to its outsized expectations. \n \n Whether that one hit, HQ Trivia, is still a success depends on how you look at it. HQ Trivia used to draw more than a million players per contest and had more than two million for some of its largest games with the biggest prizes. \n \n A large part of that audience has vanished. A recent Sunday night contest with a $25,000 prize drew 580,000 players. Last Sunday, a Disney-themed contest drew a more sizable 818,000 players, but mid-week shows have been in the 200,000 to 400,000 player range. \n \n On the other hand, HQ Trivia makes enough in sponsorship deals and in-app purchases — users can buy “extra lives” in case they get a question wrong — that the show pays for itself, according to multiple sources. HQ’s user numbers are similar to the audience size that some cable networks pull in for Sunday night prime-time windows. Disney Channel, for example, averages 836,000 viewers in Sunday night primetime, according to Nielsen. \n \n The reality, though, is that Disney maintains this audience for a three-hour window. HQ gets it for just a few minutes. HQ needs to find a second act. \n \n “HQ commands the largest live audience on mobile daily,” a company spokesperson told Recode. “We’re excited to introduce new interactive shows that will continue to engage and entertain them in new ways.” \n \n HQ co-founder and recently replaced CEO Rus Yusupov was more blunt on Twitter. “Games are a hits business and don’t grow exponentially forever,” he admitted in a tweet in August. “More soon!” \n \n As HQ’s prominence has died down, disagreements between its founders and investors have started to increase. \n \n Over the summer, HQ’s small board of directors started discussing the idea of replacing then-CEO Yusupov. HQ Trivia’s audience was declining, and some believed that Yusupov wasn’t executing fast enough on the company’s product roadmap. \n \n Instead of spending time and money developing new trivia game shows, Yusupov, who is design- and content-focused, was blowing out the production for HQ’s flagship game show with big prizes and celebrity guests, these sources say. HQ has launched a U.K. version and a sports-themed spinoff of HQ Trivia, but the plan for some time has been to create even more themed spinoffs and other games outside of the HQ Trivia format. \n \n In August, Kroll and Lightspeed’s Jeremy Liew, an early investor who is on HQ’s board, decided that Kroll should take over as CEO. The company’s two founders had at times been at odds with how to manage HQ’s operations, like how and where to invest company money, according to multiple sources. Kroll was also HQ’s “technical” co-founder — the engineer who some believed could better execute in getting the company up and running as a platform for hosting and launching multiple shows. \n \n Those differences, plus the decline in HQ’s audience, were enough to convince the majority of the board that a change needed to be made. \n \n HQ’s only other board member, Founders Fund’s Cyan Banister, refused to get involved, sources say. Founders Fund operates under a strict founder-friendly code, boasting on its website that “Founders Fund has never removed a single founder.” Banister viewed a vote in favor of one of HQ’s founders as a vote against the other. \n \n She technically gave up her board seat, and thus her vote, to avoid the conflict. She is now a board observer, according to multiple sources, and it’s unclear if she will rejoin the board at a later date. \n \n It was a two-against-one decision: Kroll and Liew on one side, Yusupov on the other. Yusupov was out as CEO and Kroll was in. \n \n Then came the complaint. Shortly after a decision to swap CEOs had been made — but had not yet been formally voted on by the board — an HQ employee filed a formal complaint with HR against Kroll for what was described by one source as “inappropriate and unprofessional” management behavior. The complaint includes allegations that Kroll used aggressive language in the office, according to two sources. \n \n The complaint was elevated to HQ’s board of directors and set off alarms, given Kroll’s past. He was previously fired from Twitter for poor management, and his behavior toward some female colleagues during his time at Twitter made some people uncomfortable. Word about that behavior started making the rounds in Silicon Valley last year while HQ was trying to raise a new funding round and prompted some investors to pass on an investment, Recode reported at the time. Kroll has since apologized. \n \n An outside investigator hired by the board looked into the new complaint and found that Kroll’s behavior “yielded no concerns,” according to the company’s statement. The board of three then voted unanimously to appoint Kroll as CEO. \n \n In an email announcing the change to company investors, Yusupov, who is now HQ’s chief creative officer, said that he “stepped down”; he characterized the move as “just an evolution of our partnership as we grow as entrepreneurs and leaders.” In reality, Yusupov was upset. He technically voted for the change, but only after seeing the writing on the wall. He wasn’t happy to lose his job running the company, according to multiple sources. \n \n Games are a hits business and don’t grow exponentially forever. HQ has massive early traction and still millions playing daily. Also developing new game formats, one of which we think is really special and complements Trivia nicely. More soon! Until then thanks for playing https://t.co/wnAcztBuJU — Rus (@rus) August 14, 2018 \n \n That saga was the latest in what has been a long history for HQ’s founding team. Yusupov and Kroll have worked together for years, mostly on mobile video projects. They’ve had a lot of success. They co-founded the looping video app Vine, which they sold to Twitter for millions in 2012. It was a cultural force in helping spur a new wave of internet celebrities before it was ultimately shut down in 2016. \n \n The duo started another company together in 2016 called Intermedia Labs, which is the parent company of HQ Trivia. Their first few mobile video apps never took off, but HQ was a quick hit. After launching in August of 2017, HQ routinely pulled in more than one million viewers per game, sometimes twice per day. \n \n About six months after launch, HQ was attracting interest from major advertisers like Nike and celebrity guest hosts like Jimmy Kimmel and The Rock. The show’s regular host, Scott Rogowsky, became such a wild internet star that he generated Justin Bieber-like hysteria when he spoke at an event for Jewish teens and community leaders early this year. \n \n But the relationship between Yusupov and Kroll hasn’t always been smooth. Yusupov was unaware of the extent of Kroll’s issues at Twitter, according to multiple sources, and it created a “rough patch” for the co-founders earlier this year when that behavior was affecting the company’s fundraising efforts. Then, of course, Kroll replaced Yusupov at HQ. \n \n Despite all this, those close to him believe that Yusupov will stay at HQ and help build out the production of the company’s new shows. \n \n But questions remain. \n \n Can Kroll succeed as CEO? He was fired from Twitter for what he himself described as “poor management,” and now there’s the formal complaint from an employee at HQ. Kroll and Yusupov are both working with an executive coach, according to multiple sources, which is not uncommon for business executives. But their prior management experience was one of the reasons investors were wary of investing in HQ. Employee complaints don’t alleviate those concerns. \n \n Then there is the business itself. The company has multiple game shows in the works, according to a source, including ideas centered around comedy and shopping. Is HQ capable of creating another hit show? Or was this a one-hit wonder? \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this story said that an email from Yusupov was sent to HQ employees. It was sent to HQ investors.']",3,"– Colin Kroll, a tech executive who co-founded the HQ Trivia app, has died. He was 35, the AP reports. The New York Police Department says officers went to Kroll's Manhattan apartment early Sunday after getting a call asking for a wellness check on him. They found him unconscious and unresponsive on his bed. He was pronounced dead at the scene. TMZ says he ""died of an apparent drug overdose,"" but the medical examiner's office will determine cause of death. Kroll was the chief executive of the trivia app, which live-streams short trivia shows to users and became popular after its release in 2017. He also was a founder of Vine, which was an app built around six-second videos, and worked for a period at Twitter. But Vine was scuttled four years after Twitter bought it in 2012, and HQ Trivia had fallen in popularity, falling from iTunes' list of 100 free games, per CNN. What's more, Intermedia Labs—a business he co-founded that created HQ Trivia—was said to be in disorder. Kroll recently ousted co-founder Rus Yusupov and engaged in behavior that one source told Re/Code was ""inappropriate and unprofessional."" Kroll had been fired from Twitter for poor managerial skills, and had a reputation for behaving poorly with some female colleagues—although a Kroll probe by an outside investigator ""yielded no concerns,"" the company said."
"['Just an hour or two a week confers life-extension benefits, researcher contends. (HealthDay)—A little jogging is good for your health, researchers say, but too much might not be. \n \n ""In this study, the dose of running that was most favorable for reducing mortality was jogging 1 to 2.4 hours per week, with no more than three running days per week,"" said study researcher Jacob Marott of the Frederiksberg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. The best pace was slow or average—about 5 miles per hour, he added. \n \n Out of a pool of about 5,000 healthy Danish adults, Marott and his colleagues followed nearly 1,100 healthy joggers and 413 sedentary people for more than 12 years. The joggers noted their hours and frequency of jogging, and their perception of their pace. \n \n The strenuous joggers, the investigators found, were as likely to die during that time period as the sedentary non-joggers. Light joggers and moderate joggers fared better, in that order, Marott\'s team found. \n \n The findings were released online Feb. 2 in advance of publication in the Feb. 10 print edition of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. \n \n What is it about strenuous running that might be harmful? ""We believe that long-term strenuous endurance exercise may induce pathological structural remodeling of the heart and large arteries,"" Marott said. \n \n However, a U.S.-based researcher said the debate about the optimal dose of running for longevity is far from resolved. \n \n The new study has limitations, said D.C. (Duck-chul) Lee, an assistant professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the study. \n \n In Lee\'s own study of 55,000 adults, including more than 13,000 runners, he found a lower risk of death over the follow-up period in joggers with the highest running time and frequency—nearly three hours a week and at least six times a week—compared with non-runners. It was published in 2014, also in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. \n \n In the Copenhagen study, joggers self-reported their pace. Even the slow joggers were getting vigorous exercise, the researchers said. \n \n ""The reported pace was not an absolute pace in miles per hours, but the subjects\' own perception of pace as slow, average or fast,"" Marott said. He said that\'s more appropriate than an absolute scale when the age range is as wide as it was in their study (ages 20 to 95). In general, however, the slow or average pace was about 5 miles per hour or a 12-minute mile, and the fast pace was 7 miles per hour or about an 8-minute mile, he said. \n \n In the United States, about 54 million people run regularly, according to background information with the study. In 2013, more than 540,000 people finished a marathon (26.2 miles), and nearly 2 million completed a half marathon. \n \n One limitation of the current study, Lee said, is that a very small group logged the most jogging time. Just 47 joggers put in more than four hours a week, and only 80 ran more than three times a week. These small numbers could have affected the comparisons and results, Lee said. \n \n Also, the researchers didn\'t look at more than 3,500 active non-joggers who exercised in other ways, Lee said. The researchers looked only at death from all causes, he said, instead of looking to see if high jogging miles and times affected certain causes of death, which could have given more specific information about potential harms. \n \n ""More [running] may be worse only in cardiovascular disease,"" he said. In another assessments on the effects of running and death rates, Lee\'s group found that death from all causes was lower in runners compared with non-runners, regardless of how much they ran, but there was a slight trend for less benefit from higher doses when compared with lower doses. \n \n The study\'s good news, Lee said, is that the researchers found benefit even in jogging less than an hour a week, or even once a week, compared to not jogging at all. Perhaps this will motivate sedentary people to get moving, he said. \n \n Although the study by Marott and colleagues found an association between light jogging and improved survival rates, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. \n \n ""Basically, the study still shows it\'s a much better option to prescribe some form of running as a part of a healthy lifestyle and that sedentary behavior is not a prescription for long-term health and mortality,"" said Dave Watt, executive director of the American Running Association and the American Medical Athletic Association. \n \n Explore further: Regular jogging shows dramatic increase in life expectancy \n \n More information: For tips on starting to exercise, see the American Heart Association.', ""Americans as a whole don’t exercise enough—at least that’s what the latest studies show—and so the message is clear: get more active, take walks, Let’s Move! Basically anything is better than sitting on the couch. But how much exercise is enough? That’s a hotly debated question for which experts still don’t have a satisfactory answer. But given that most of us are starting from a sedentary position, the assumption has long been the more the better. \n \n But in a report published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology researchers from Denmark say that people who push their bodies too hard may essentially undo the benefit of exercise. Those who ran at a fast pace more than four hours a week for more than three days a week had about the same risk of dying during the study’s 12-year follow up as those who were sedentary and hardly exercised at all. The link held even after the researchers accounted for potentially confounding factors such as age, sex, whether the participants had a history of heart disease or diabetes, or whether they smoked and drank alcohol. \n \n MORE This Is How Much Exercise Experts Really Think You Need \n \n In fact, those with the lowest risk of dying during the study period were people who ran less than three times a week for one to 2.4 hours, at a slow to moderate pace. Even people who ran slightly more, for 2.5 hours to four hours a week at an average pace less than three times a week, showed slightly higher mortality risk, at 66%, something that came as a surprise to the authors. \n \n See the 10 Healthiest Cities to Live in America Colin Anderson—Blend Images/Corbis Getty Images Matt Hogan/www.mphoganphoto.com Jim Wilson—The New York Times/Redux Getty Images Celin Serbo—Aurora Photos/Corbis Misty Keasler—Redux for TIME Getty Images K.C. Cohen—Courtesy of Boston Children's Hospital Getty Images 1 of 10 Advertisement \n \n “I would expect the light joggers to have really low risk,” says Jacob Marott, a researcher at the Copenhagen City Heart Study at Frederiksberg Hospital and one of the study’s co-authors. “But regarding the moderate joggers, I was a little surprised they didn’t have a bigger benefit from jogging than the light joggers. It made me think that if it’s really true, then exercise recommendations should take that into account.” \n \n MORE It Doesn’t Matter How Much You Exercise If You Also Do This \n \n What Marott and his team found was that both too little running and too much running are linked to higher rates of death. The most intense runners ended up with a risk of dying that was similar to that of those who opted to stay on the couch. Somewhere in between is the Goldilocks amount that’s just right to maintain heart health, burn off excess calories and keep blood sugar levels under control. And according to his results, that sweet spot is closer to the ‘less’ side of the curve than the ‘more’ side. \n \n That dovetails with the mounting research that so-called micro-workouts—high intensity but brief workouts that could be as short at 1 minute, according to another recent paper—may be better for the body than long and continuous workouts. \n \n That still means that some exercise is better than no exercise, but scientists may be getting more sophisticated about understanding that more isn’t always better, and that there may be a tipping point at which the harms of running start to outweighed its benefits. \n \n Those negative effects might include things like changes in the structure and function of the heart and its vessels; previous studies showed that marathoners and long distance cyclists, for example, tend to be at higher risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms, and may be more vulnerable to enlarged hearts, which are less efficient at pumping blood and delivering oxygen and removing waste than normal-sized organs. \n \n MORE Short Bursts of Exercise Are Better Than Exercising Nonstop \n \n Marott acknowledges that it’s also possible that some other behaviors or factors common to avid runners, such as their exposure to the sun, which can increase their risk of skin cancer, might be explaining their higher risk of dying during the study. Other studies will have to investigate whether that’s the case, but in the meantime, Marott says “if you want to do something good for yourself, you don’t have to be extreme. Jogging one to four hours a week for no more than three days a week at a slow to moderate pace is actually achievable. And that’s a positive take-home message.” \n \n Read next: 7 Reasons Why You’re Working Out and Still Not Losing Weight \n \n The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Running too much can be just as bad for you as being sedentary, the study suggests. Researchers tracked some 1,100 healthy runners and 413 sedentary folks over a period of more than 12 years, HealthDay reports via Medical Xpress. People ranged in age from 20 to 95. The risk of dying during the study turned out to be approximately the same among heavy runners—those who ran quickly more than three days a week for a total of more than four hours—and sedentary people who rarely exercised, Time reports. The best plan, according to the study, was to run lightly: The group that had the best results ran at a slow-ish pace (about 5mph) less than three times each week, going for an hour to 2.4 hours total. Even a group that ran a bit more often and longer saw a slight increase in death risk, Time notes. The findings could perhaps relate to cardiovascular problems previously observed in the most die-hard runners and cyclists. ""If you want to do something good for yourself, you don’t have to be extreme,"" says a study author. But another researcher points to a number of possible flaws in the findings, including the fact that the hardest-running group was quite small.

"['People pray before placing flowers at a sidewalk memorial to the teacher and student who were shot to death Monday at North Park Elementary School in San Bernardino, Calif., Tuesday, April 11, 2017. (AP... (Associated Press) \n \n People pray before placing flowers at a sidewalk memorial to the teacher and student who were shot to death Monday at North Park Elementary School in San Bernardino, Calif., Tuesday, April 11, 2017. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon) (Associated Press) \n \n LOS ANGELES (AP) — A 9-year-old boy wounded by a gunman who opened fire and killed his estranged wife at a California elementary school was recovering Wednesday and in good spirits, his family said. \n \n Nolan Brandy remained hospitalized after being shot Monday in a classroom at North Park Elementary School in San Bernardino, officials said. \n \n Nolan and another student were behind teacher Karen Smith when her husband, Cedric Anderson, began firing 10 rounds from a .357 Magnum, officials said. \n \n The other boy, 8-year-old Jonathan Martinez, died after being rushed to a hospital. Anderson shot and killed himself in the classroom before police arrived. \n \n Nolan\'s parents, Leon and Rachel Brandy, were thankful for the outpouring of community support after the shooting, they said in a statement issued by school officials. \n \n A photo released by school officials showed the boy in a hospital bed with a blue and white stuffed rabbit on his lap as his parents leaned over him. His father\'s hand lay gently on Nolan\'s head as the boy smiled. \n \n ""Please continue to pray for him and also for Jonathan Martinez\'s and Karen Smith\'s families,"" the family said in the statement. \n \n Martinez had Williams syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by learning delays, mild-to-moderate intellectual disabilities and heart problems. He had previous heart surgery and school officials said he was a happy child who loved music and playing with friends. \n \n Anderson, 53, walked into the classroom and opened fire without saying a word, San Bernardino police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. \n \n Just a month into their marriage, Anderson accused his wife earlier this year of infidelity — though police have said there is no evidence of that. When he failed to win her back, he shot and killed her, Burguan said. \n \n Smith told family members that Anderson had threatened her after she moved out, but she didn\'t take him seriously and thought he was just seeking attention, the police chief said. \n \n Anderson had been arrested four times since 1982, though none resulted in convictions, Burguan said. The arrests were made on suspicion of spousal battery in 2012 and suspicion of brandishing a knife in 2013. Police in Torrance were called to his home five times that year. \n \n Anderson\'s ex-wife filed for a restraining order against him in 1996, after he told her he would kill her and her children and take his own life when she refused to pay for their divorce, the woman wrote in court documents. \n \n One of Anderson\'s girlfriends was granted a restraining order in 2013 after she said he held a pillow over her face, according to court papers. Attempts to reach members of Anderson\'s family have been unsuccessful. \n \n Hundreds of people attended a candlelight vigil for the victims Tuesday evening at North Park Elementary.

However, sometimes we want to share quick information about WS to people we meet and video might not be feasible. Below is a quick explanation of Williams syndrome which is often just enough to share with friends in the community. You are encouraged to download and share electronically or print (it is business card size and can be easily carried for reference and/or distribution.) \n \n Full-size image here \n \n An easy way to print in quantity can be found on Avery Design and Print (click here). \n \n Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition that is present at birth and can affect anyone. It is characterized by medical problems, including cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and learning challenges. These often occur side by side with striking verbal abilities, highly social personalities and an affinity for music. \n \n Williams syndrome is caused by the spontaneous deletion of 26-28 genes on chromosome #7. The deletion occurs in either the egg or the sperm used to form the child with Williams syndrome. Accordingly, the deletion is present at the time of conception. It is likely that the elastin gene deletion accounts for many of the physical features of Williams syndrome. Some medical and developmental problems are probably caused by deletions of additional genetic material near the elastin gene on chromosome #7. The extent of these deletions may vary among individuals. In most families, the child with Williams syndrome is the only one to have the condition in his or her entire extended family. However, the individual with Williams syndrome has a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of his or her children. \n \n WS affects 1 in 10,000 people worldwide – an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United States. It is known to occur equally in both males and females and in every culture. \n \n Children with Williams syndrome tend to be social, friendly and endearing. Parents often say the joy and perspective a child with WS brings into their lives had been unimaginable. \n \n But there are major struggles as well. Many babies have life-threatening cardiovascular problems. Children with WS need costly and ongoing medical care and early interventions (such as speech or occupational therapy) that may not be covered by insurance or state funding. As they grow, they struggle with things like spatial relations, numbers, and abstract reasoning, which can make daily tasks a challenge. As adults, most people with Williams syndrome will need supportive housing to live to their fullest potential. Many adults with WS contribute to their communities as volunteers or paid employees; often working at assisted living homes for senior citizens, hospitals and libraries, or as store greeters or veterinary aides. \n \n Just as important are opportunities for social interaction. As people with Williams syndrome mature – beyond the structure of school and family activities – they often experience intense isolation which can lead to depression. They are extremely sociable and experience the normal need to connect with others; however people with Williams syndrome often don’t process nuanced social cues and this makes it difficult to form lasting relationships. \n \n There are many physical features and medical challenges which are fairly common to Williams syndrome. However, every child is an individual - the number of features present, and which features are present varies from child to child. \n \n Common features of Williams syndrome include: \n \n Characteristic facial appearance \n \n Most young children with Williams syndrome are described as having similar facial features. These features include a small upturned nose, long philtrum (upper lip length), wide mouth, full lips, small chin, and puffiness around the eyes. Blue and green-eyed children with Williams syndrome can have a prominent ""starburst"" or white lacy pattern on their iris. Facial features become more apparent with age. \n \n Heart and blood vessel problems \n \n The majority of individuals with Williams syndrome have some type of heart or blood vessel problem. Typically, there is narrowing in the aorta producing supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), or narrowing in the pulmonary arteries. There is a broad range in the degree of narrowing, ranging from trivial to severe (requiring surgical correction of the defect). Since there is an increased risk for development of blood vessel narrowing or high blood pressure over time, periodic monitoring of cardiac status is necessary. \n \n Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels) \n \n Some young children with Williams syndrome have elevations in their blood calcium level. The true frequency and cause of this problem is unknown. When hypercalcemia is present, it can cause extreme irritability or ""colic-like"" symptoms. Occasionally, dietary or medical treatment is needed. In most cases, the problem resolves on its own during childhood, but lifelong abnormality in calcium or Vitamin D metabolism may exist and should be monitored. \n \n Low birth-weight / slow weight gain \n \n Most children with Williams syndrome have a slightly lower birth-weight than their brothers or sisters. Slow weight gain, especially during the first several years of life, is also a common problem and many children are diagnosed as ""failure to thrive"". Adult stature is smaller than average \n \n Feeding difficulty (generally limited to the early years) \n \n Many infants and young children have feeding problems. These problems have been linked to low muscle tone, severe gag reflex, poor suck/swallow, tactile defensiveness etc. Feeding difficulties tend to resolve as the children get older. \n \n Irritability (colic during infancy) \n \n Many infants with Williams syndrome have an extended period of colic or irritability. This typically lasts from 4 to 10 months of age, then resolves. Abnormal sleep patterns with delayed acquisition of sleeping through the night may be associated with the colic. Extreme irritability may also be caused by hypercalcemia in some children with WS. \n \n Dental abnormalities \n \n Slightly small, widely spaced teeth are common in children with Williams syndrome. They also may have a variety of abnormalities of occlusion (bite), tooth shape or appearance. Most of these dental changes are readily amenable to orthodontic correction. \n \n Kidney abnormalities \n \n There is a slightly increased frequency of problems with kidney structure and/or function. \n \n Hernias \n \n Inguinal (groin) and umbilical hernias are more common in Williams syndrome than in the general population. \n \n Hyperacusis (sensitive hearing) \n \n Children with Williams syndrome often have more sensitive hearing than other children; certain frequencies or noise levels can be painful and/or startling to the individual. This condition often improves with age. \n \n Musculoskeletal problems \n \n Young children with Williams syndrome often have low muscle tone and joint laxity. As the children get older, joint stiffness (contractures) may develop. Physical therapy is very helpful in improving muscle tone, strength and joint range of motion. \n \n Overly friendly (excessively social) personality \n \n Individuals with Williams syndrome have a very endearing personality. They have a unique strength in their expressive language skills, and are extremely polite. They are typically unafraid of strangers and show a greater interest in contact with adults than with their peers. \n \n Developmental delay, learning challenges and attention deficit disorder \n \n Most people with Williams syndrome will have mild to severe learning differences and cognitive challenges. Young children with Williams syndrome often experience developmental delays. Milestones such as walking, talking and toilet training are often achieved somewhat later than is considered normal. Distractibility is a common problem in mid-childhood, which can improve as the children get older. \n \n Older children and adults with Williams syndrome often demonstrate intellectual ""strengths and weaknesses."" There are some intellectual areas (such as speech, long term memory, and social skills) in which performance is quite strong, while other intellectual areas (such as fine motor and spatial relations) show significant weakness.']",4,"– Jonathan Martinez, the 8-year-old boy killed in Monday's San Bernardino school shooting, was ""the happiest kid you'll ever meet"" despite the rare genetic condition he suffered from, says teaching assistant Jennifer Downing. Jonathan was born with Williams syndrome, which affects around one in 10,000 people and causes developmental delays as well as heart problems, the AP reports. But the genetic condition, which the boy's family want to raise awareness of, also makes children friendly and sociable, qualities Jonathan was known and loved for at North Park Elementary, the San Bernardino Sun reports. Downing says Jonathan, who had already undergone heart surgery once, was also the best reader in the class. Jonathan was killed in his special-needs classroom when Cedric Anderson opened fire on his estranged wife, teacher Karen Smith. Fellow teacher Diane Abrams says the boy's sweet nature makes the violent manner of his death even harder to deal with."" He was so special to teach. He was curious to learn and wanted to do his very best,"" she tells the Los Angeles Times. ""He'd sit with his hands folded at his desk and look at me and say, 'Ms. Abrams, am I being an all-star?'"" A GoFundMe page set up to help the family has so far raised more than $121,000 of its $10,000 goal. Nolan Brandy, the 9-year-old boy wounded in the shooting, was still in the hospital Wednesday but was recovering and in good spirits, his family says."

An explosion ripped through a... (Associated Press) \n \n Syrian security forces clashed Monday with gunmen in an upscale neighborhood of the capital Damascus that is home to embassies and senior officials in one of the worst confrontations in the tightly-controlled city center in the country\'s yearlong uprising. At least three people were killed. \n \n The clash deep in Mazzeh district in west Damascus shows the shifting nature of the conflict in Syria, and suggests that rebels might be trying to offset government morale gains from recent successful offensives against opposition strongholds areas in the north and center of Syria by striking close to where senior regime members live. \n \n Damascus has been largely free of the daily shootings and deaths reported across the country since the uprising against Assad began in March last year. But in addition to gunbattles in Mazzeh and in the suburbs, the capital has witnessed several major bomb attacks targeting security facilities, most recently on Saturday. The government blames ""terrorists"" for the bombings but the opposition says that the regime itself may be carrying them out to discredit the uprising. \n \n Monday\'s fighting broke out when security forces stormed an apartment used as a hideout by an ""armed terrorist"" group in Mazzeh after evacuating the building of all inhabitants, the state-run news agency SANA said. \n \n It added that the forces killed two of the gunmen and arrested the third while a member of the security forces also lost his life. SANA gave no further details. \n \n A resident of the western Mazzeh district said automatic rifles and machineguns were used in the two-hour clash that ended at about 4 a.m. local time. ""We also heard three strong explosions,"" said the man who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal. \n \n He added that the clash was close to the Swiss embassy and the home of Maj. Gen. Assef Shawkat, the deputy chief of staff for security affairs who is married to President Bashar Assad\'s sister, Bushra. \n \n Armed rebels are active in Damascus\' suburbs and satellite towns but rarely venture into the heart of the capital where Assad\'s troops are deployed in force. \n \n The new fighting shows that rebels can still strike in the heart of the capital despite successful government offensive in the past weeks in the suburbs of Damascus, in the central city of Homs and the northern region of Idlib. \n \n The U.N. says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the year-long uprising. \n \n Syrian authorities claim the opposition is made up of ""terrorist"" groups carrying out a foreign conspiracy. \n \n An activist in the capital said the Monday morning clashes occurred near the Political Security Directorate building. He said the clashes were followed with raids by security forces who were searching for the attackers. \n \n The Local Coordination Committees activist group reported a heavy presence of security troops as well as pro-government gunmen known as shabiha in Mazzeh. It added that many police vehicles were patrolling the area. \n \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of activists throughout Syria, said 18 of Assad\'s troops were wounded in the clashes. It described the clashes ""as the most violent of its kind and closest to security centers in Damascus since the revolution began."" \n \n The rebel Free Syrian Army, which includes thousands of army defectors, have claimed responsibility in the past for attacks against regime forces. \n \n The group\'s leader, Col. Riad al-Asaad, refused to comment on the fighting in Damascus when contacted by The Associated Press by telephone. ""This is a sensitive military matter that we cannot comment about,"" he said from Turkey. \n \n On Saturday, three suicide bombings in Damascus killed 27 people. Two of them also targeted government security buildings. \n \n On Sunday, an explosion killed two and wounded 30 in the northern city of Aleppo, Syria\'s largest. \n \n The Observatory said troops shelled the central village of Qalaat al-Madiq in central Hama province heavily damaging two homes. It added that troops stormed the northern village of Ebdita and set about 60 homes on fire. \n \n The group said gunmen opened fire at a car in the northern province of Idlib killing an army lieutenant colonel and wounding two other members of the military. \n \n ___ \n \n Bassem Mroue can be reached on twitter at http://twitter.com/bmroue', 'Russia joins Syria truce calls as fighting rages \n \n DAMASCUS — Syria\'s ally Russia added its voice Monday to rising calls for a truce so aid can be sent to violence-hit cities after deadly clashes rocked a district of the capital near the heart of the embattled regime. \n \n France, meanwhile, pressed the UN Security Council to adopt a statement backing international envoy Kofi Annan\'s mission to end bloodshed that has cost an estimated more than 9,100 lives in the past year. \n \n President Bashar al-Assad\'s security forces launched attacks in several regions, opposition activists said. \n \n Pre-dawn fighting in a heavily guarded area of Damascus, the capital\'s fiercest since the revolt against Assad\'s regime erupted, came as residents still reeled from deadly weekend bombings. \n \n At least three rebels and a member of the security forces were killed in the upscale western neighbourhood of Mazzeh, state television and monitors said. \n \n ""Three terrorists were killed and a fourth was arrested in the fighting between security forces and an armed terrorist gang sheltered in a house of a residential district,"" the TV reported. \n \n Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said four rebels were killed. \n \n Mourtada Rasheed, an activist in Damascus, said blasts and heavy shooting could be heard in Mazzeh and two other districts -- Qaboon and Arbeen. \n \n In Russia, International Committee of the Red Cross chief Jakob Kellenberger met Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose country is an ally of Damascus and has some influence on the regime. \n \n ""The two parties call for the Syrian government and armed groups to immediately agree to a daily humanitarian truce to allow the ICRC access to the wounded and to civilians who need to be evacuated,"" the foreign ministry said. \n \n Moscow ""underscored the need to allow the ICRC access to all detained persons in Syria following the protests"" against Assad\'s regime. \n \n An ICRC spokeswoman said the Moscow meeting was part of Kellenberger\'s broader efforts to prompt world powers to secure commitments from the regime and rebels to lay down their arms for a few hours each day. \n \n ""The ICRC hopes to see concrete results of such meetings on the ground in the coming days and weeks,"" Victoria Zotikova told AFP. \n \n Kellenberger expressed fears that much of Syria could soon be engulfed in the type of brutal violence recently seen in the flashpoint city of Homs, where hundreds died in more than a month of shelling and a subsequent army assault. \n \n ""This is absolutely unacceptable to us,"" he told ITAR-TASS. \n \n Meanwhile, a mission sent by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan arrived in Damascus for talks on a monitoring operation to end the conflict. \n \n ""There are five people with expertise in political, peacekeeping and mediation,"" Annan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told AFP. \n \n ""They will be staying for as long as they are making progress on reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Mr Annan\'s proposals,"" he added. \n \n On Monday, France proposed a UN Security Council statement giving strong backing to Annan\'s efforts. \n \n ""The aim now is to find common ground and send a strong message to the Damascus regime,"" a diplomat in New York said, with French Ambassador Gerard Araud saying Paris hopes for a vote on Tuesday. \n \n The Annan proposal includes a halt to the violence, humanitarian access, the release of detainees held over the past year and withdrawal of security forces from protest cities. \n \n As a condition for ceasefire talks, the Damascus government insisted that the opposition had to lay down its arms, diplomats at the United Nations said. \n \n At the same time, neighbouring countries had to guarantee they would not send weapons to Syrian groups or give political or financial support to the opposition, they told AFP on condition of anonymity. \n \n Separately, technical experts from the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation are taking part in a Syrian government-led mission to assess the impact of the deadly crackdown. \n \n The mission to 15 cities, on the first such assignment in Syria since the violence started, was launched in Homs on Sunday. \n \n Monday\'s clashes in the capital came after twin car bombs ripped through two neighbourhoods of Damascus on Saturday, killing 27 people, according to an interior ministry toll. \n \n An Observatory statement said fresh fighting erupted later on Monday between rebels and security forces in the Qaboon and Barzeh areas of Damascus. \n \n Troops backed by dozens of tanks also raided districts of Deir Ezzor city in eastern Syria, the Observatory said, a day after at least 25 army deserters were killed in seizing its Hamidiyeh district. \n \n Five soldiers, including two officers, were also killed, it said. \n \n And troops bombarded the Bab Sbaa, Khalidiyeh and Karm al-Shami districts of Homs, the monitoring group said. \n \n Troops in the northwestern province of Idlib attacked Abdita, home village of defector Colonel Riyadh Asaad, head of the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army, local activist Nurredin al-Abdo told AFP. \n \n Security forces killed at least nine civilians on Monday -- including a young girl -- in Idlib, Homs and the southern province of Daraa, while a captain who deserted was killed

"['Are Nevada officials actually trying to preserve the state\'s marijuana black market? \n \n In the first four days that Nevada residents could legally purchase marijuana for recreational uses, state retailers made $3 million in sales—and lined the state government\'s coffers to the tune of a cool $500,000 in tax revenues, according to the Las Vegas Sun. \n \n Actually, that can\'t be right. Allowing for rounding, that only accounts for about 15 percent of sales—which is the state excise tax on the first wholesale sale. Nevada also imposes a 10 percent retail excise tax on recreational sales, and then adds in sales tax, which varies from just under 7 percent to over 8 percent according to where you are. Let\'s call the total tax take about 32 percent of legal recreational marijuana sales. That\'s a really high tax rate to impose on any industry—especially one that was thriving (albeit illegally) and entirely untaxed less than two weeks ago. \n \n The confusion is understandable, given that Nevadans voted to legalize pot just last November and state officials dragged their feet on complying until the last minute. The market for marijuana is currently operating under emergency regulations issued July 6 after booze distributors went to court to protect a temporary, legally guaranteed monopoly on recreational marijuana sales guaranteed them by last year\'s ballot measure. In June they won an injunction prevent the state from authorizing competing licensees and the whole process threatened to founder. \n \n ""State officials are clearly rushing into this hoping no one will notice how sloppy implementation is actually going,"" Rafael Lemaitre, a former top staffer in the Obama administration\'s Office of National Drug Control Policy, told the Sun. \n \n That the state might need to make room for more retailers to hang out their shingles is evident from reports of hours-long lines for people to make legal purchases. \n \n Undoubtedly, many people were willing to endure long lines because of the novelty of legal marijuana sales and the festive nature—fireworks!—of the holiday weekend launch. But novelty wears off. You have to assume that Nevada pot connoisseurs might soon tire of long waits when they could certainly get quick delivery from whichever underground entrepreneurs had their business before July 1—especially when calling old dealers could also bypass that high tax. \n \n Nevada isn\'t exactly inventing the wheel here, either. Other states have legalized marijuana in the past, and their experiences offer lessons to anybody willing to learn. \n \n ""Colorado and Washington both initially levied tax rates of over 30 percent and struggled to reduce the size of the black market,"" the Tax Foundation\'s Lindsey Lassiter and Matthew Stadnicki recently noted. ""Nevada could face similar troubles stamping out the black market."" \n \n To keep people from reverting back to their reliable and responsive black market dealers, Lassiter and Stadnicki recommend that the state focus on a lower, relatively easily implemented retail sales taxes. Reduced burden and simplicity would encourage compliance. So, they say, would reducing the tax differential between the legal recreational market and the legal medical marijuana market, so that supply doesn\'t get diverted from the one to the other. If Nevada lawmakers don\'t make some changes, well… \n \n Nine months after Colorado legalized recreational sales, PBS reported that black market marijuana remained far cheaper than the legal stuff, and stifling red tape made it difficult and expensive to open an aboveground business. Little has changed since then, except that the state has actually tightened regulations and recently hiked the marijuana sales tax by 50 percent. \n \n ""It seems kind of odd that at the same time they\'re trying to do something about the black and gray markets they\'re going to ratchet up the taxes and drive more people to the black and gray markets,"" former state Sen. Pat Steadman (D-Denver) commented earlier this year. \n \n Washington state also tried its luck with sort-of legalization of marijuana that bound the market in restrictions and burdened it with high vice taxes (37 percent excise tax). Lawmakers and regulators channeled their inner commissars and tried to create a centrally planned market with caps on production and sales outlets. Lower prices and easier access—including home delivery—were two big competitive edges possessed by illegal dealers that led Seattle Weekly to conclude last September that ""four years after legal weed, Seattle\'s black market still thrives."" \n \n State lawmakers recently voted down legalization of delivery services—a change that would have eliminated one major advantage possessed by underground vendors. \n \n So…What\'s Nevada\'s excuse? Having seen states elsewhere enter into legalization of marijuana half-heartedly, and preserve a healthy black market as a result, it\'s impossible for lawmakers to claim they can\'t predict the outcome of their efforts to nominally legalize a product while retaining some of the worst aspects of prohibition via intrusive taxes and rules. \n \n Then again, officials in Colorado and Washington have been living with the results of their bad choices, and seem unwilling to undo the damage. If you\'re incapable of learning from your own experiences, it\'s unlikely that you\'ll suddenly see lessons elsewhere. \n \n Whatever the motivations of officials in Nevada and their counterparts in other states, you can anticipate that ""legalizing"" marijuana while burdening it with tight rules and high taxes will have legal dealers competing with underground vendors for a long time to come.', 'Articles, lectures, videos, and other informational resources regarding the history of the Church.', 'In this Saturday, July 1, 2017, photo, people line up at the NuLeaf marijuana dispensary in Las Vegas.

(Associated Press) \n \n LAS VEGAS (AP) — Recreational marijuana sales have exceeded the expectations of Las Vegas area store owners, who have seen long lines outside their dispensaries since Saturday, when Nevada became the fifth state with shops selling pot to the public. \n \n That move jumpstarted a market projected to be fueled by the tens of millions of visitors that Sin City welcomes each year. \n \n Eager pot customers on Monday again lined up before dispensaries opened their doors. Some were looking to make their first purchase since Saturday, and others were shopping for seconds. Tourists and locals alike have taken advantage of the change in state law. \n \n ""I\'m a very happy with the way sales have gone and continue to go, especially when you consider that the word didn\'t really get out ahead of time."" said Andrew Jolley, president of the Nevada Dispensary Association and a store owner. ""The public really only had a couple of weeks\' notice, whereas Colorado had a full year to prepare."" \n \n Nevada voters approved legalizing recreational pot in November, but regulations needed before the sales could start weren\'t approved until the past two weeks. The state later this week will release a report regarding the unannounced enforcement inspections that were conducted Saturday at dispensaries across the state. \n \n The demand for recreational marijuana has been such that dispensaries had to turn away customers in line over the weekend, and at least one extended its hours of operation. Dispensaries reported wait times of 45 minutes to an hour Saturday afternoon and up to 20 minutes Sunday. \n \n The Euphoria Wellness dispensary had 50 people waiting to make purchases midmorning Monday. Its marketing coordinator, Jim Ferrence, said budtenders helped at least 1,000 customers during the first two days of legal recreational pot sales. \n \n Customers on average bought a quarter of an ounce of marijuana flowers and a sampling of various edibles and concentrates, Ferrence said. ""Everyone was calm, cool and collected. No unruly crowds at all,"" he said. \n \n Those 21 and older with a valid ID can buy up to an ounce of pot. As of Friday, the state had licensed 44 dispensaries to sell recreational marijuana. Thirty-nine of those shops are in the Las Vegas area. \n \n More than 42 million tourists flock for business and pleasure to Las Vegas every year. They along with visitors to the rest of Nevada are expected to make nearly two of every three recreational pot purchases in the state. \n \n But people can only use the drug in a private home as it remains illegal to consume it in public, including the Strip, hotels and casinos. Violators face a misdemeanor citation and a $600 fine. \n \n Fifteen tourists on Monday hopped on a bus for a three-hour tour of dispensaries in the Las Vegas area. The ""Cannabus"" took the visitors to two stores with whom they have an agreement to allow riders to skip the lines. \n \n The recreational marijuana sales did not cause Las Vegas police a headache over the weekend. The department did not deploy additional officers and does not track misdemeanor citations, Officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said. \n \n ""It was business as usual,"" he said. ""Everything went smooth as far as we can tell."" \n \n The state stands to earn millions from the sales of recreational marijuana, but the tax collection data won\'t be available for several weeks. \n \n Nevada joins Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Alaska in allowing adults to buy the drug that\'s still banned by the federal government. The market in the Silver State is expected to outpace all others in the U.S., at least until California starts its sales. \n \n ""With all due respect to Denver, Seattle, and Portland, Las Vegas is already the party capital of the world, and this is just an extension of that,"" Ferrence said.

The tax rate for recreational pot is 33 to 38 percent, depending on local regulations, with all state and local taxes included. A 15 percent tax on wholesale marijuana distribution from cultivation and production facilities included in the total tax rate did not contribute to this week’s tax revenue, as dispensaries loaded up on supply prior to July 1 when the new wholesale tax took effect. \n \n “We had a higher demand than everybody initially thought,” dispensary association director Riana Durrett said. “It shows this market really exists.” \n \n Thousands of marijuana shoppers took to dispensaries over the weekend, forming lines as long as three hours for their chance to legally purchase the plant.

Jason Bean \n \n AP file photo/gannett illustration: Marijuana growing in Medford, Ore. (Photo: AP file) \n \n Nevada dispensaries licensed to sell recreational marijuana are running out of pot less than a week after the legal market came to life, according to the state Department of Taxation. \n \n On Friday, taxation officials announced that Gov. Brian Sandoval had endorsed the department\'s ""statement of emergency,"" allowing state officials to consider adopting an emergency regulation that could alleviate the shortage. \n \n The regulation would allow the department to consider a larger pool of applicants for distribution licenses, licenses that permit the transport of recreational marijuana from the cultivation and packaging facilities to the dispensaries.The Nevada Tax Commission will vote on the regulation on Thursday. \n \n As of Friday, the taxation department has issued not one distribution license because of a last-minute court battle, incomplete applications and zoning issues, meaning dispensaries will not be getting a delivery for a while. \n \n ""Based on reports of adult-use marijuana sales already far exceeding the industry’s expectations at the state’s 47 licensed retail marijuana stores, and the reality that many stores are running out of inventory, the Department must address the lack of distributors immediately. Some establishments report the need for delivery within the next several days,"" said department spokeswoman Stephanie Klapstein in an email Friday. \n \n More: Nevada marijuana prices rise, product may sell out \n \n More: Nevada celebrates first legal recreation marijuana sales \n \n More: Which Reno marijuana dispensaries have recreational pot? \n \n As the state law legalizing recreational marijuana was passed in November, wholesale alcohol distributors were promised exclusive rights to transport wholesale marijuana for the first 18 months of legal sales. Since November, the state has received seven applications from liquor wholesalers. \n \n ""We continue to work with the liquor wholesalers who have applied for distribution licenses, but most don’t yet meet the requirements that would allow us to license them. Even as we attempted to schedule the final facility inspection for one of the applicants this week, they told us their facility was not ready and declined the inspection,"" Klapstein said. \n \n The department tried to address the issue earlier this year by opening the application process up to the businesses that have been transporting medical marijuana and other marijuana businesses, but an 11th hour court battle ended in an order only to accept applications from wholesale alcohol distributors. The taxation department since appealed the court\'s decision. \n \n Now that any marijuana dispensary licensed to sell recreational marijuana must receive all product -- both recreational and medical -- from a distributor licensed to transport recreational marijuana, many of them are stuck with dwindling supplies of flower and edibles both. \n \n ""The business owners in this industry have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build facilities across the state. They have hired and trained thousands of additional employees to meet the demands of the market. Unless the issue with distributor licensing is resolved quickly, the inability to deliver product to retail stores will result in many of these people losing their jobs and will bring this nascent market to a grinding halt. A halt in this market will lead to a hole in the state’s school budget,"" Klapstein said. \n \n If the regulation passes and the taxation department issues distribution licenses, not all of the industry\'s hardships will be solved. Many cultivation centers are in the midst of the grow cycle of some strains of marijuana, meaning there will be a lag between dispensaries selling out and the next harvest. Additionally, some cultivation centers already have sold futures of their next crop. \n \n While the department does not plan to release any numbers on state tax revenue from the industry until late September, the Nevada Dispensary Association earlier this week estimated that dispensaries made about $3 million in sales and the state made about $1 million in tax revenue between July 1 and July 4. \n \n Revenue collected from the 15 percent cultivation tax goes toward schools, while the 10 percent sales tax revenue goes toward the state\'s rainy day fund, which can be used for any number of expenditures. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://www.rgj.com/story/news/marijuana/2017/07/08/nevada-fire-resources/452606001/']",5,"– Nevada on July 1 became the fifth state to sell recreational marijuana to the public, and one week later, it declared an emergency. But the chaos is on the licensing side of things. The new law allows those 21 and up to buy up to an ounce of pot from what are 47 licensed dispensaries, reports the AP. The problem, explains Vice News, is that the only way for dispensaries to legally get pot for the next 18 months is via wholesale liquor distributors, who secured the exclusive right via a November ballot measure. But of the seven liquor distributors to have applied for a license to restock dispensaries, zero have ""met the application requirements."" That's where the statement of emergency, signed Friday by Gov. Brian Sandoval, comes in. It says the emergency regulation is needed to allow the Department of Taxation to figure out whether limiting licenses to liquor dealers will result in an insufficient number of pot distributors in the state. This is a real concern, because without pot sales, ""the State will not realize the revenue on which the State budget relies."" Indeed, the Las Vegas Sun reports the first four days of sales brought in $500,000 in tax revenue, with the six-month tax estimate set at $30 million. The whole thing has been a bit of a saga: In mid-June, liquor distributors won a preliminary injunction banning the state from handing out licenses to other entities, Reason notes. As for how pot sales have happened to date, dispensaries were able to stock up pre-July 1. But ""some establishments report the need for delivery within the next several days,"" a rep for the department said in an email to the Reno Gazette-Journal Friday."
"['ROME — In his narrowest escape yet, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi barely survived a confidence vote on Friday, saving his government from collapse but leaving it all but incapable of legislating effectively. \n \n With 316 votes for and 301 votes against, Mr. Berlusconi’s center-right coalition won the vote. But it failed to secure a solid majority, making it increasingly difficult for him to pass legislation aimed at protecting Italy from Europe’s sovereign debt crisis. Had he lost, Mr. Berlusconi would have had to resign, marking the end of an 18-year political era in which the billionaire businessman shaped Italian politics in his own image, entwining the country’s fate with his own. \n \n In what the daily Corriere della Sera called “an atmosphere of interminable agony,” analysts said the Berlusconi government was now hanging by a thread and could fall at the next bump in the road — when enough disgruntled lawmakers from within Mr. Berlusconi’s coalition calculate that they would be safer jumping off a sinking ship rather than staying aboard and risking drowning. \n \n Mr. Berlusconi called the confidence vote after failing to pass a routine measure this week. Addressing lawmakers on Thursday, the prime minister said he was the only “credible alternative” able to govern Italy through the economic crisis, and refused to step down. \n \n Since 2009, the European debt crisis has felled governments in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia, led to early elections in Spain and a cabinet reshuffle in Greece. So far, Mr. Berlusconi has proven to be a tough outlier — not least because the European Central Bank in August agreed to buy Italian debt. But the bank did this in exchange for promised structural changes that the government has not yet carried out, a mix of tax increases and changes to the pension system. The results of Friday’s vote promise to make that even more difficult. \n \n This week, opposition leaders — and the president of Italy, in an unusually strong statement — told Mr. Berlusconi that surviving a confidence vote was not the same as governing. In the statement, President Giorgio Napolitano said the prime minister had to show the “necessary cohesion” to tackle Italy’s budget deficits and to propose “adequate solutions to the urgent problems of the country, including in meeting its European obligations.” \n \n Despite deep divisions over economic policy, the center-left opposition has repeatedly called on Mr. Berlusconi to step down. \n \n “This government will die from confidence,” the leader of the center-left opposition, Pierluigi Bersani, said after Friday’s vote, the ANSA news agency reported. “Starting tomorrow, the political problems will be even more evident,” he added, reiterating his calls for Mr. Berlusconi to step down. Another leading opposition politician, Antonio Di Pietro of the Italy of Values Party, has repeatedly accused Mr. Berlusconi of buying the votes of would-be dissidents within his own center-right coalition. \n \n On Friday, Mr. Berlusconi was saved by loyalists who prefer to have the government limp along rather than fall and potentially be replaced by a group of nonpolitical technocrats with a mandate to carry out the structural changes including tax increases, changes to the pension system and a growth stimulus bill now deadlocked in Parliament. \n \n Foreign investors and many of Italy’s business leaders hope for such a technical government, but lawmakers have resisted out of fears of losing power. \n \n Friday’s vote made clear that Italy had been living with the shadow of Mr. Berlusconi. \n \n “In this interminable twilight, the man who was Berlusconi remains true to his salesman’s essence,” the satirist and political commentator Massimo Gramellini wrote recently in the Turin daily La Stampa. He will continue to survive, Mr. Gramellini added, until his supporters “start to deny that a man like that, capable of selling us nothing for 20 years, ever really existed.”', 'Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi survived a confidence vote in Parliament on Friday, but his narrow majority raises doubts over his ability to govern effectively when the country needs a steady hand during its economic crisis. \n \n Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi sits in the lower chamber to attend a confidence vote, in Rome, Friday, Oct. 14, 2011.

(Associated Press) \n \n Berlusconi\'s conservatives won in a 316-301 vote in Parliament\'s lower house. After days of tension, the premier\'s allies clapped when the result of the vote was announced. \n \n Berlusconi has been weakened by sex scandals and criticized for his handling of Italy\'s economy. He has been facing repeated calls for his resignation from his political rivals, labor unions and parts of the business community that once considered him their savior. \n \n Even some of his own allies have openly expressed disappointment, with at least two deserting the crucial vote Friday. \n \n Had he lost the vote of confidence, Berlusconi would have been forced to resign _ about 1 1/2 years before the end of his term, in 2013. \n \n Three ratings agencies have downgraded Italy\'s public debt, citing the country\'s political gridlock and low growth prospects as key reasons. The vote Friday appeared to do little to reassure markets. \n \n ""The best signal that Italy could have sent to the markets would have been to boot Mr. Berlusconi out, but it has failed to do so,"" said Sony Kapoor, managing director of Re-Define an Economic Think Tank, shortly after the vote. ""With Mr. Berlusconi still at the helm, there is nothing that Italy can do from within that will restore market confidence."" \n \n The 75-year-old leader has steadfastly hung onto power despite the scandals and four criminal trials in Milan. He has always maintained his innocence and blamed what he says are overzealous, left-leaning prosecutors bent on ousting him from power \n \n He insisted that there is no alternative to his government. He said the vote Friday amounted to an ""ambush"" by the opposition, and moments after the vote, he spoke to reporters about his plan to spur the country\'s moribund economy. \n \n Italy is under pressure to come up with growth-promoting measures to avert being dragged into the widening sovereign debt crisis. \n \n This week, Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, who takes over the helm of the European Central Bank on Nov. 1, urged the government to act more quickly to implement reforms that can spur growth _ beyond the austerity package that put Italy on the path to balance its budget by 2013. \n \n Otherwise, Draghi warned that the rising cost of borrowing to service national debt seen over the last three months will eat up ""no small part"" of the austerity package approved by Parliament last month. \n \n ""The goal of relaunching growth is finally largely shared, but the adoption of the measures necessary so far have banged up against apparently insurmountable difficulties,"" Draghi said.']",2,"– Silvio Berlusconi squeaked through a confidence vote in the Italian parliament today, but the agonizingly close 316-301 vote didn’t exactly inspire, well, confidence. Berlusconi’s majority is so slim that it effectively cannot pass legislation, the New York Times reports, and analysts say that the slightest bump in the road could break the fragile coalition entirely. Berlusconi called the vote himself after failing a routine vote this week and refusing calls to step down. Berlusconi survived thanks to loyalists afraid his government would be replaced by a non-political technocratic one seeking structural changes to Italy’s economy—a government they’d have no place in. Of course, many business leaders were hoping for exactly that. “The best signal that Italy could have sent to the markets would have been to boot Mr. Berlusconi out, but it has failed to do so,” one economic think tank director tells the AP. Opponents, meanwhile, complained that Berlusconi can win confidence votes, but cannot govern. “He only knows how to stay stuck in his seat using tricks,” one opposition leader complained."
"['New research suggests that lakes of liquid water could be buried in the icy crust of Europa, a moon of Jupiter. The processes that create the lakes could also provide nutrients crucial for life on Europa, the scientists say. \n \n A file image from the Galileo spacecraft shows the Conemara region of Jupiter\'s frozen moon Europa. Scientists say the surface features suggest that a lake of liquid water once existed beneath the ice. \n \n Mysterious depressions and domes on Jupiter\'s ice-encrusted moon Europa may signal the presence of subsurface lakes, at least one of which holds enough water to fill the American Great Lakes. \n \n The finding, if confirmed, could be a boost for those who speculate that simple forms of life could exist on the moon. \n \n For several decades, scientists have known that an ocean of liquid water exists beneath Europa\'s crust of ice. But some research suggests that Europa\'s ice shell could be miles thick. The subsurface lakes described by NASA scientists Wednesday, however, appear to exist within that icy mantle, meaning they would be at a far shallower depth than the underlying ocean. \n \n Moreover, the lakes could be part of a planetary dumb-waiter system that transfers potential nutrients from the surface to the subsurface ocean, the team suggests. That transfer of nutrients could be crucial to any potential life on Europa. \n \n With liquid water, Europa already has one necessary ingredient for life. That has made it ""a compelling object for study for decades,"" says Tori Hoehler, an astrobiologist at NASA\'s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., who was not part of the research team. \n \n But another requirement for life, he adds, is a source of energy, a.k.a. food. The moon\'s upper crust is rich in compounds that could be a food source, but the potential nutrients would need a system to deliver them to the ocean deep below. \n \n The mechanism that forms the subsurface lakes – involving rising plumes of heat – could provide that service, the team suggests. \n \n If the team is right, ""you\'ve moved from a system that checks [off] one of the requirements for life to a system that checks two requirements for life,"" Dr. Hoehler says. \n \n The results, set for publication in Thursday\'s issue of the journal Nature, grew out of an attempt to explain two different areas within Europa\'s ""chaos terrain"" – a landscape of jumbled surface features visible in images from the Voyager and Galileo spacecraft. \n \n The two areas that have puzzled scientists cover significant large patches of the moon\'s surface and host icebergs with ground-up ices filling the channels in between – much as jumbled ice chunks fill gaps between icebergs as they calve from ice shelves in polar regions on Earth. \n \n One of the two areas appeared as a depression in the surface. The other appeared as a dome. \n \n ""Why are these two features so similar but so different?"" says Britney Schmidt, a planetary scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who led the research team. \n \n In trying to solve the puzzle, the team was struck by parallels on Earth. Similar features are apparent in ice that forms above under-ice volcanoes, as well as at ice shelves where warm sea water is thought to be thinning the ice from underneath. \n \n The team suggests that plumes of warmer water, heated by Europa\'s core, migrate up through the thick icy crust until they reach a ""sweet spot"" where a combination of pressure, temperature, and the composition of the ices allows a subsurface lake to form. Since liquid water takes up less volume than water ice, the icy lid on top of the lake begins to crack and collapse in a kind of frigid sink hole. The surface ice breaks into chunks in the process. As it does, some of it overturns, mixing the potential nutrients into the water below. \n \n That explains the depressions. But what about the domes? \n \n Over time, the lake refreezes and expands. This pushes remaining large ice blocks upward. The brine surrounding the blocks also refreezes, expanding as it does, adding to the dome. \n \n One of the features, Thera Macula, is a depression, suggesting that a Great Lakes-scale body of water some two miles below currently is sculpting the surface, the team says. A dome feature, known as Conamara Chaos, represents the end of another lake\'s thaw-freeze process. \n \n Over time, researchers have debated whether the icy shell covering Europa is thin or thick – thick roughly defined as more than six miles top to bottom. But neither camp can adequately explain how the chaos terrain forms, the team posits. \n \n The team\'s new explanation ""is a really interesting half-way point that is much more realistic,"" says Geoffrey Collins, a planetary scientist at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass. ""It\'s not just \'only liquid down here and only ice up there.\' There are perched lakes or slushy areas in the ice shell that may be having a huge effect on the surface geology,"" he says. \n \n The thin-thick argument is of interest to astrobiologists, says Dr. Collins. If the crust is thick – say, 18 miles or so – that would leave little hope of ever being able to sample the ocean and check for signs of life. If it\'s thin, hope would spring eternal for sending a robotic mission to study what\'s beneath. \n \n The new explanation leaves open the possibility for exploring potentially habitable environments even if the icy shell turns out to be a thick one. \n \n Collins, however, is less convinced that the process can bring nutrients in the upper crust down to any hidden ocean. In the scenario the team lays out, the heat plumes that form the lakes – and the lakes themselves – don\'t come into contact with an ocean at any depth below the surface. \n \n But Curt Niebur, NASA\'s program scientist for the outer planets, explains that it\'s possible the overturning ice can transfer any potential nutrients to the water or slush below. That leaves the enriched material free to migrate back down through cracks in the ice. \n \n These ideas require missions to Europa to test them, researchers acknowledge. \n \n Even so, ""I\'m really excited"" about the team\'s proposed solution to the chaos terrain conundrum, Collins says. Thick shell or thin, if the presence of the lakes can be verified, they could be ""interesting, accessible bodies of liquid water.""', 'Jupiter’s smallest Galilean moon, Europa, not only has a massive global ocean, it has huge lakes beneath its icy crust, according to new research. \n \n NASA has been very confident for about a decade that there is a huge ocean on Europa, according to NASA program scientist Curt Niebur. But the ocean is capped by an ice crust and no one was sure about its thickness. Europa is relatively large among the dozens of moons of Jupiter. \n \n Some scientists thought it was a mile or two thick, but most scientists thought it was several miles thick. A thick crust would be bad news for life because it would mean the ocean could never splash up on Europa’s shores to interact with possible sources of food needed to sustain life. \n \n New research announced Wednesday indicates the crust is thick, but it also shows that there are lakes above the oceans and that they are churning. This is key, because it means possible life forms in Europa’s oceans could make it the surface via the lakes to find food. \n \n ""One opinion in the scientific community has been, \'If the ice shell is thick, that\'s bad for biology — that it might mean the surface isn\'t communicating with the underlying ocean,\' "" according to Britney Schmidt, a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas at Austin\'s Institute for Geophysics and the lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature. \n \n ""Now we see evidence that even though the ice shell is thick, it can mix vigorously. That could make Europa and its ocean more habitable,"" she said in a statement. \n \n This is fantastic news for scientists hoping find signs of life on Europa, said Niebur. \n \n The lakes are estimated to be 2 to 3 miles below the crust, while the oceans are estimated to be 30 miles down, Niebur said. “It’s a missing link to understanding to whether it (Europa) could support life.” \n \n Scientists are basing their findings, in part, on what they learned from images taken by the old Galileo spacecraft, which was launched in 1989 to gather data and images from Jupiter and its moons. (It crashed into Jupiter in 2003). Those pictures show round bumps called chaos terrains. Based on the way ice moves around on Earth, the researchers developed a model to explain the bumps. \n \n The only way to confirm the model would be to fly a spacecraft to Europa to investigate. A mission is on the drawing board, but NASA hasn’t approved anything yet, according to Niebur.']",2,"– The chances of life existing on Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa—and of Earthlings being able to find it—are looking a lot stronger, NASA scientists say. A vast ocean is believed to lie beneath as much as 20 miles of ice on Europa, but new research suggests that huge lakes exist a lot closer to the surface. A suspected interchange of water between the lakes and the ocean means that nutrients could be transferred from near the surface to life far below, the BBC reports. The research team examined bumps known as ""chaos terrain"" on Europa's surface and developed models based on the way ice moves around on Earth. If the researchers are right, ""you've moved from a system that checks one of the requirements for life to a system that checks two requirements for life,"" an astrobiologist tells the Christian Science Monitor. The only way to confirm the findings would be to send a spacecraft to Europa to investigate. A mission is on the drawing board but NASA hasn't approved anything yet, CNN notes."

Battery % was on 92% last night, 3g is not on, wifi also, and now the battery is on 69%. unbelievable!!!"" \n \n In the midst of the complaints, one user chimed in with a more reasoned approach: ""Don\'t rely on immediate numbers when you\'ve had mixed pre/post patch usage. Most likely you need to reset the network/device itself and discharge/recharge! It\'s not magic!

Users of the iPhone 3G also griped about short battery life. Older versions of iOS, or the iPhone OS, such as OS 1.1.3 and OS 2.1 triggered grumblings over the same issue. \n \n But complaints seem to be on the rise.

"['Oscar de la Renta was a great man, and a great American designer. Over five decades he made fashion that was elegant, based on the tools of the trade that he learned in Spain at Balenciaga, and in Paris, at Lanvin under Antonio Castillo. I also considered him one of my close, best friends. He truly cared about my well-being, regardless of whether or not it was my weight-loss battle, or was I lonely, and would I come dine with him and Annette at home in New York. I spent Thanksgiving with him, about eight or nine years ago, just the three of us and his son Moises in Kent, Connecticut. Family was of the utmost importance to him. The wedding he and his wife created for stepdaughter Eliza Bolen’s nuptials, was one of the most beautiful and original country weddings I ever attended. And the social world was there in full force. \n \n Oscar was king of the historical social anecdote, no matter if it was about the Marquis de Cuevas’s famous costume ball, or Marie-Hélène de Rothschild’s dinners. He lived through his youth, following the great bullfighters of Spain, when he worked in Madrid, he honed his design DNA in Paris and with his great success in New York, he always gave back, philanthropically. He personally supported an orphanage in the Dominican Republic. This was one of his passions—he provided housing, food, education, and hope for those beautiful children. \n \n I met Oscar de la Renta, in 1974, when I arrived in New York. He was then wed to his first wife, Françoise de Langlade, a former French Vogue editor-in-chief. Oscar and Françoise took me under their wings and mentored me socially. \n \n Every single morning, Françoise would call me once I got to my desk at Women’s Wear Daily down on Twelfth Street. It was an open floor plan then, and my desk was no more than ten steps from John Fairchild’s desk with a low bookcase separating us. I was an accessories editor, and at night, a beat reporter. This is where I learned my craft as a social chronicler. Françoise would often call me up and ask me where I had been and what I had done the night before. \n \n Oscar and his wife were the first to invite me to dinner in their home, with the likes of Dr. Henry Kissinger, or Tatiana and Alexander Liberman; they also invited me to dinner when they were in Paris, with their friends, like Cristiana Brandolini d’Adda and the late Andre Olivier. \n \n One day, Françoise called me and said I had messed up socially, I had forgotten to come to lunch with just her and Annette Reed, now Mrs. de la Renta. In those days—the seventies—Oscar and Françoise were the Social Lions of New York. They served the best food and made dinner at home a vast, rich experience of color and textures with wine and decor. In the new book, Valentino: At the Emperor’s Table, Valentino specifically wanted me to write in the introduction how Oscar and his wife were the best and most outstanding New York host and hostess. \n \n His impeccable personal style with people, parties, and fashion fueled his work. Known for his appropriate elegance, he always designed with the ultimate motivation that women must look and feel beautiful. Having worked beside him on so many of his Balmain haute couture collections for nearly a decade as a stylist, I watch him return again and again to his roots, the highest standards of French couture, having first apprenticed with Cristóbal Balenciaga in Madrid, and then working as designer at Castillo-Lanvin. There was always a sense of the flourish of a great flamenco flounce in his dinner and evening dresses, the bias elegance of silk charmeuse in slim sheath dresses, and simple black or white cashmere coats, that his wife Annette loved. In the winter, she often wears one of his cashmere coats to dinner and never removes it, she loves them so. \n \n In 2013, Oscar asked me to help him with an exhibit that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton organized on First Lady style at the Clinton Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. We all flew down to the presidential library and the show was full of exquisite, elegant de la Renta clothes worn by former First Ladies from Nancy Reagan to Laura Bush. \n \n As evidenced in his last great wedding dress, which he designed for Mrs. George Clooney, Oscar was also a master of the grand wedding gown. My favorite, of course, was the dress and veil he designed for Elizabeth Shaffer, who got married last summer. Oscar and Annette took a helicopter and flew down from Connecticut to Long Island so that he could make the final adjustments just before she walked down the aisle. \n \n Some of my fondest memories of Oscar are in his native Dominican Republic, diving into a natural waterfall in the mountains, or having the ultimate pleasure of seeing him dance. He was the best dancer. It was a joy just to be in his presence, especially in his beautiful homes and gardens, where happiness reigned. \n \n Click through the slideshow below for Oscar de la Renta’s best moments in Vogue.', 'By Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images. \n \n Oscar de la Renta, a storied couturier with a flair for the romantic, who dressed countless members of Hollywood, political, and actual royalty in a six-decade fashion career, died Monday at age 82 at his home in Kent, Connecticut, his wife Anette de la Renta told The New York Times. \n \n De la Renta had battled cancer at various intervals in recent years. \n \n Born in the Dominican Republic, and trained in Spain and Paris, the designer studied under Balenciaga and designed for Lanvin before starting his eponymous label that catered especially to the socialites of the day like Babe Paley and C.Z. Guest. He dressed many a First Lady in his illustrious career, such as Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama. \n \n During a 2009 interview with Vanity Fair’s John Heilpern, the designer admitted that the “ladies who lunch” were never his target clients. \n \n “Let me tell you, it was never the ladies who lunch. They never lunched! They always wanted to stay thin.” \n \n “You want to know who my customer is?” he asked. “All the women who can afford to buy my clothes! My customers are successful workingwomen.

His illness, the paper notes, didn't slow him down: He designed Amal Alamuddin's dress for her wedding to George Clooney just last month, and his business expanded by 50% in the eight years he faced the disease. The Dominican Republic-born designer's clientele ranged from first ladies—including Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, and Michelle Obama, Vanity Fair reports—to Oscar winners. ""You want to know who my customer is?” he once asked. ""All the women who can afford to buy my clothes!"" He began work in fashion design in the 1950s in Spain, when the wife of the then-US ambassador saw his drawings and sought a dress for her daughter. His career moved him to Paris and eventually the US in 1963. By the 1970s, de la Renta and his first wife, Françoise de Langlade, were ""the Social Lions of New York,"" André Leon Talley writes in Vogue. The Times notes that the couple were central to the rise of designers as the social elite. But de la Renta didn't see his work as particularly ""heavy. Somebody might ask, 'What is Oscar de la Renta?' And you could say, 'It's a pretty dress.'"""
"['Getty \n \n Rihanna is giving Madonna a run for her money. The 25-year-old singer is approaching the 54-year-old industry veteran\'s record for the most No. 1 songs on Billboard\'s Dance/Club Play Songs chart. \n \n Rihanna\'s recent hit ""Right Now"" topped the dance chart this week, giving Rih her 20th No. 1 song in the category, according to Billboard. Rih beat out Janet Jackson with this total, who was formerly in second place with 19 entries on the chart. With hits including ""Pon De Replay,"" ""Only Girl (In the World),"" and ""We Found Love,"" Rihanna now holds the number two spot, only falling behind Madonna. \n \n Madonna shouldn\'t be too worried -- the iconic pop star currently holds the title for most No. 1 songs on the dance chart with 43, more than double Rihanna\'s take. While Rihanna nabbed her first No. 1 for the category in 2005, Madonna charted her first dance hit in 1983. \n \n In typical Rihanna-style, the singer could be seen wearing highly risque getups celebrating Crop Over festivities in Barbados. There\'s no indication that she was celebrating her new second-place title, but the accolade certainly couldn\'t have detracted from the joyous mood. \n \n For more on Rihanna, head over to Billboard.', 'Passing Janet Jackson, Rihanna now trails only Madonna for the all-time chart record. \n \n Rihanna\'s latest No. 1 smash on Dance/Club Play Songs, ""Right Now,"" is a special one.

""Right Now"" hung out in the lower region of the chart for 10 weeks, peaking at No. 33, until it fell off the chart in late April. \n \n Then, when official remixes of ""Right Now"" were released and promoted to club DJs last month, the track re-entered the chart at No. 44. It jumped to No. 1 six weeks later. \n \n ""Right Now"" was remixed for club floors by the likes of by Dyro, Sick Individuals, Justin Prime and Ralphi Rosario. \n \n ""Where Have You Been"" followed a similar trajectory last year.

"['Fresh from the debut of its Double Down Dog , KFC has unveiled its newest product: an edible coffee cup. \n \n The cup, named the \'Scoff-ee Cup\' is made from biscuit, wrapped in sugar paper and then lined with a layer of heat-resistant white chocolate to keep the coffee hot and the cup crispy. \n \n Once the chocolate lining melts over time, the biscuit begins to soften causing it to melt in your mouth. \n \n One of the founders of The Robin Collective, Brandy Wright, said: “not only do the edible cups taste amazing, but they smell delicious too. We’ve infused different cups with a variety of ambient aromas including \'coconut sun cream\', \'freshly cut grass\' and \'wild flowers\'."" \n \n ""These scents were used in our recipes as they have a natural ability to evoke the positive memories we associate with warm weather, sunshine and summer holidays. Things that make everyone smile.” \n \n Brand Manager at KFC Jocelyn Bynoe said: “we have been experimenting with edible packaging to see if it could be a feasible product to bring to market in limited quantities and thought that if our customers occasionally like to have their cake and eat it, why wouldn’t they want have their cup and eat it instead!” \n \n \n \n Not your ordinary cup (INSTAGRAM: jess13simpson) \n \n Created to mark the launch of KFC\'s Seattle Best Coffee across its UK branches, the \'Scoff-ee Cups\' are still in their development phase with plans to trial them at a limited number of stores later in the year. \n \n The last few months have seen the fast food world become increasingly diverse and creative, from Burger King\'s new delivery service, Domino\'s ""Tummy Translator"" app, to Pizza Hut\'s ""subconscious menu"". \n \n What on earth can we expect next? \n \n WATCH: How to make the perfect cup of coffee', 'To celebrate the launch of Seattle’s Best Coffee in its restaurants, KFC has developed a unique range of coffee cups, which are 100% edible.

It\'s not yet on sale, but KFC says it hopes to bring them to some U.K. stores this year. There are no U.S. plans at this time. \n \n ""If our customers occasionally like to have their cake and eat it, why wouldn\'t they want to have their cup and eat it, instead? poses KFC spokeswoman Jocelyn Bynoe. She says KFC has been experimenting with edible packaging for some time to see if it could be a feasible product to bring to market in limited quantities. \n \n No specifics, yet, on how many calories will be stuffed into the edible cup. \n \n In concept, edible fast-food containers could appeal to consumers on several levels, says branding expert Tracey Riese. ""It could fit with any number of brand positions from \'fast\' (no bussing); to \'green\' (no waste) to \'fun\' (at least, it seems fun.),"" she says. \n \n But this is mostly aimed at environmentally-minded Millennials, who want products and packaging to leave a smaller footprint. There\'s a huge market for new packaging technologies that are better for the environment. \n \n Last year, Stonyfield, the environmentally conscious organic yogurt maker, took its first baby step towards ultimately eliminating the plastic yogurt container. It rolled out a product dubbed Stonyfield Frozen Yogurt Pearls -- frozen yogurt sold inside edible, fruit-flavored packaging skins -- at a handful of Whole Foods stores in the Boston area. \n \n One environmentalist group says it\'s a potential fan of edible packaging. The U.S. has an overall recycling rate of 34.5% and 51% rate of packaging recycling -- much lower than many other developed countries, says Darby Hoover, senior resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \n \n ""Companies that make these packages have an obligation to help ensure those packages aren\'t wasted,"" she says. ""Edible packaging has the potential to be a meaningful part of that opportunity."" \n \n The company making the KFC edible cups is the Robin Collective, a London-based food science specialist. The company also has worked on infusing aroma into other cups, including some that smell like coconut, fresh-cut flowers or freshly mown grass. \n \n The edible cup concept is not a perfect fit for KFC, says Riese, but, she adds, ""it\'s not off-brand, either."" She sees it more as a ""promotion novelty"" than a brand-building strategy. \n \n But Riese says KFC has to make absolutely sure of one thing before rolling out the edible cup to any stores: it must work perfectly every time. \n \n ""An icky experience,"" she says, ""would hurt any brand that brought it to market."" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1BuCy3l']",2,"– UK customers who buy a cup of coffee at Kentucky Fried Chicken soon won't have to throw their cups away—they'll just eat them.

Cups also will be infused with different scents. So far, the chain hasn't announced plans for a similar rollout in the US, but USA Today sees a potentially big market among millennials looking for greener packaging.

"['A measure that would require porn performers to wear condoms while filming in Los Angeles County was approved by voters. \n \n The measure garnered 55.9% of the vote after a hard-fought campaign, \n \n ""This is a major referendum on the subject of safer sex,"" said AIDS Healthcare Foundation President Michael Weinstein. \n \n The measure is sponsored by the foundation, which has been pushing for years to protect adult-film performers from HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. \n \n Under the measure, the cost of the law would be paid for by porn producers, who would have to purchase a public health permit, much like tattoo parlors. Violators would be subject to fines and misdemeanor criminal charges. \n \n Weinstein said the question now is whether the adult-film industry and the county government will cooperate. \n \n ""We have shown our resolve that we are not going to give up on this issue,"" he said. ""Now that the people have spoken so overwhelmingly, it is the responsibility for the Board of Supervisors and the county Health Department to act immediately to enforce this law.”', 'California Rejects Labeling Of Genetically Modified Food; Supporters Vow To Fight On \n \n What a difference $46 million in TV ad spending can make. \n \n At least that was the consensus in the wee hours of the morning at the Yes on Proposition 37 party, held at a performance art space in San Francisco\'s Mission District, even before the final votes were tallied. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption cheeseslave/Flickr.com cheeseslave/Flickr.com \n \n Outspent many times over, ""we couldn\'t get up on the air,"" organizer Stacy Malkan told The Salt when it appeared the measure was going down. ""You need a certain saturation to have an impact."" \n \n All eyes in the food world have been on California\'s hotly contested genetically modified (GMO) food labeling proposal, which was defeated this morning by a significant margin — 53 percent of the state\'s voters opposed and 47 percent in favor. \n \n It would have required that most foods containing genetically modified ingredients carry a ""Made with GMO"" label on the box. Given the prevalence of genetically engineered corn and soy in processed foods, those labels would have been nearly ubiquitous in the middle aisles of the grocery store. And, given the size of California\'s market, and manufacturers\' opposition to distribute two versions of packaging, the California law could have morphed into de facto national policy as well. \n \n The news was well-received in the No camp, which had argued that the proposal would be expensive and confusing. ""We said from the beginning that people should take a close look at 37, that it\'s not as simple as it seems from the surface,"" Kathy Fairbanks with the No on 37 campaign, which didn\'t hold a public party, told us last night when it appeared the measure would be defeated. ""The more voters learned about 37, the more they realized they didn\'t like it."" \n \n But supporters were unbowed. In fact, they say, even though Proposition 37 lost, a grass-roots movement came together with a clear purpose (unlike the Occupy movement, Grist snarks) to focus on what\'s on our plates. ""Don\'t mourn, #organize!"" is a popular Twitter update from supporters today. \n \n ""Californians and all Americans deserve the right to know what\'s in their food,"" said Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives for Consumers Union, in a statement released this morning. ""Unfortunately, Proposition 37 was defeated by a wildly deceptive smear campaign financed by Monsanto, DuPont and other industry opponents of the public\'s right to know,"" she said. \n \n So about that campaign. The No on 37 camp, which opposed GMO labeling, raised $45.9 million, thanks in large part to biotech giant Monsanto, along with a familiar roster of big-supermarket brands: Kraft, Heinz, Sara Lee, Pepsico, etc. The main message? Your groceries will cost more. \n \n Meanwhile, Yes on 37 brought in $9.4 million from a far crunchier lineup, including tiny-print soap makers Dr. Bronner\'s, Whole Foods and the Illinois-based nutritional supplement maker Joseph Mercola. Oh, and Hollywood: Gwyneth Paltrow single-handedly raised $80,000 for the Yes camp after endorsing the campaign on her Facebook page. Danny DeVito and Dave Matthews pitched in for a TV ad. And, said Malkan, ""Sting\'s people were calling us last night, asking what they could do to help."" \n \n But it was too little, too late, she added. Despite an initially hefty lead by the pro-labeling folks, Proposition 37 support took a dive soon after the No on 37 ads hit the airwaves. Within two weeks, support for 37 dropped 9 percentage points, according to one poll from Pepperdine University and the California Business Roundtable. \n \n The No camp also got a boost from a series of high-profile endorsements, including one from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the country\'s largest science organization. \n \n Proposition 37 and other labeling propositions ""are not driven by evidence that GM foods are actually danger\xadous,"" wrote the AAAS board of directors. ""Indeed, the science is quite clear: Crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe."" \n \n As we reported earlier this summer, some legal experts raised concerns about how the proposal was written and suggested that it would add confusion — not clarity — to food labels. And, several of the state\'s big newspapers — the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose Mercury News — all came out against the labeling proposal for similar reasons. \n \n Other states have proposed similar labeling measures.']",2,"– Californians voted yesterday in a pair of hot-button referendums, passing a law mandating that porn stars wear condoms while striking down another that would require the food industry to label genetically modified foods. The former means that adult performers in LA County not only have to wrap up, reports the LA Times, but producers will also have to get a public health permit, like tattoo parlors, something AIDS activists say is a major step forward. That bill passed with a 59% majority. The bill that would require foods containing genetically modified ingredients to bear a label reading ""Made with GMO"" was struck down by a 53% to 47% margin, reports NPR. Opponents said the labels would be expensive and confusing to consumers, not to mention ubiquitous in grocery stores, since many items include GMO corn and soy products. The so-called Frankenfood bill's popularity dropped off a cliff after Monsanto waged a $46 million ad war against it; supporters of the bill vow to continue fighting for the labels."

"['SINGAPORE/BEIJING Flamboyant former basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea on Tuesday for a five-day visit, his second this year, but said he had no plans to negotiate the release of a jailed American missionary. \n \n There had been speculation that Rodman, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March, would secure the release of Kenneth Bae, who was jailed for 15 years for trying to overthrow the North Korean government. \n \n ""I\'m not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae,"" Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview before he left Beijing for Pyongyang. ""I\'m just going there on another basketball diplomacy tour."" \n \n Kim, the third of his line to rule North Korea, is a basketball fan and appeared to get on well with Rodman on the earlier visit, with the two of them pictured laughing, eating and drinking together and watching an all-star basketball match. \n \n Rodman\'s latest trip is being sponsored by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power. His arrival was announced on North Korean news agency KCNA, which did not provide any further details of the trip. \n \n Wearing his trademark dark sunglasses, the 6-foot 7-inch (2.01 meter) Rodman pushed through a throng of journalists at Beijing\'s international airport, a common waystation for travelers to North Korea. \n \n ""I\'m just trying to go over there to meet my friend Kim, the Marshal,"" Rodman said. ""Try to start a basketball league over there, something like that."" \n \n North Korea cancelled a visit by Robert King, U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, to Pyongyang last week on what the U.S. State Department said was a ""humanitarian mission"" to negotiate the release of Bae. \n \n King\'s trip was initially seen as a signal that relations between Washington and Pyongyang might start to improve. North Korea said it withdrew the invitation because of annual military drills last week by the United States and South Korea. \n \n Rodman drew fire for his earlier trip to Pyongyang at a time when North Korea was threatening the United States, South Korea and Japan with missile strikes. \n \n He called Kim, 30, who rules unchallenged in a country where there are an estimated 150,000-200,000 prisoners in work camps, ""an awesome kid"". \n \n Bae, a Korean American who had been working as a Christian missionary in China and North Korea, was arrested in the northeast port city of Rason late last year. \n \n The North Korean supreme court said it sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for plotting to overthrow the state.

"['MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — The Latest on the April Fools\' Day storm to hit northern New England. (all times local): \n \n 3:30 p.m. \n \n The April Fools\' Day snowstorm that hit parts of northern New England is winding down, but it\'s not keeping everyone from enjoying the joke. \n \n Erik Lustgarten and Tracy Neff were in Portland, Maine, reveling in the snow Saturday during their weekend away from home in Newburyport, Massachusetts. \n \n Lustgarten said New England residents have to stay on their toes, given the region\'s weather. Neff said the snow was ""fabulous."" \n \n By late afternoon, up to 18 inches of snow had fallen in some locations. \n \n Utility crews across Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine continued to work on restoring power to thousands of customers. \n \n ____ \n \n 2:30 p.m. \n \n Saturday\'s storm that brought heavy, wet snow to much of northern New England is winding down, but not before dumping up to 18 inches of snow, causing traffic accidents on highways across the region and leaving thousands without power. \n \n Meteorologist Eric Schwibs of the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, called the storm nature\'s idea of an April Fools\' Day joke, although late-season storms aren\'t that unusual. \n \n Wintry weather also reached southern New England. Boston accumulations were expected reach 3 to 4 inches. A flood warning was in effect for several Massachusetts counties after many areas received up to 2 inches of rain. \n \n ___ \n \n It\'s April Fools\' Day but it\'s no joke: People across northern New England woke up to a foot of heavy wet snow on parts of the region and expected more throughout the day Saturday. \n \n Meteorologist Eric Schwibs of the National Weather Service office in Gray, Maine, said Portland got about 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) of snow in the storm that began Friday. He said roads were slippery. \n \n Electric utilities across the three northern New England states reported a total of about 16,500 power outages Saturday morning: about 6,000 in Vermont, 3,500 in New Hampshire and 7,000 in Maine. \n \n Schwibs called the storm nature\'s idea of an April Fools\' joke, but it\'s not unusual to see late-season snow storms.', 'Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier used April Fools’ Day this afternoon to take a shot at President Trump‘s Twitter habits, announcing a bill to stop his “unsupervised tweets”: \n \n I will be introducing a bill next week which will prohibit @POTUS from posting unsupervised tweets. https://t.co/vNpeVFBj3J — Jackie Speier (@RepSpeier) April 1, 2017 \n \n The president took to Twitter after watching segments on Fox News, on subjects ranging from Chuck Todd to The New York Times to this: \n \n Wow, @FoxNews just reporting big news.

Almost. And one of the longstanding masters of the tech prank, Google, is at it again with a fresh batch of trickery. \n \n This year, the jokes are more obviously fake this time around in what appears to be an effort to avoid anyone actually thinking these products actually exist. \n \n Nevertheless, some of these products would be kind of cool, despite how wildly impractical they are. \n \n Here\'s the running list of what Google\'s ""rolled out"" today so far: \n \n Google Gnome \n \n Although the name rhymes with the very real Google Home, this imagined Google digital assistant is instead designed to sit outdoors and help you out with all matters related to weekend backyard lounging and the occasional bit of garden work. \n \n Delivering information bits about weather, edible plant life and a surprisingly dark array of opinions, Google Gnome is what Google Home would be like if it showed up in an episode of Black Mirror — helpful, but just a tad too ominous with its robot apocalypse leanings. \n \n Haptic Helpers \n \n The quickest way to get a tech-centric laugh nowadays is to show some idiot fumbling around while blinded by yet another new VR headset. But Google smartly goes in another direction and actually addresses an issue that has yet to be solved in virtual reality: haptics. \n \n Haptic Helpers actually brings human Google workers into your home to assist you with your VR experience by providing you with all of the other sensory input that you can\'t otherwise get on current VR Systems. From smell, to taste, and even touch, Haptic Helpers show us the next best solution for full VR immersion until we actually have holodeck-level sensory input. \n \n Google Wind \n \n Stepping up the April Fools\' Day game to a new level, Google\'s team in the Netherlands came up with an imaginary system called Google Wind that links the country\'s 1,170 windmills together using ""machine learning [that] enables all the mills to collaborate."" Once those windmills are linked, they are able to literally blow clouds out of the sky to allow the country to have more sun-filled days. \n \n Somehow, as ridiculous as this one looks, it\'s reminiscent of the very real weather modification initiatives that have been documented in years past. Nevertheless, the special effects showing people being blown away by the power of the windmill mechanisms adds just the right amount of whimsy to let you know that Google is in fact just playing around with yet another wild ""what if"" idea. \n \n Google Puchi Puchi Keyboard \n \n Also getting in on the international prank fun is Google Japan, whose team came up with perhaps the most ingenious fake gadget in a keyboard made of bubble wrap. The Puchi Puchi keyboard (in Japanese, ""puchi puchi"" translates as bubble wrap), allows the user to simultaneously enjoy the feeling of popping those tiny plastic bubbles included in packing materials while typing out a message. \n \n Once the message has been popped out, a Puchi Puchi reader rolls over the popped material to decipher the message. Yes, this is stupid. But for some reason, I actually want this. They even added a special version of the Puchi Puchi Keyboard that releases pleasant fragrances when you pop the bubbles, including air from places like Hawaii. \n \n Someone please actually make this. \n \n Google Cloud on Mars \n \n Definitely one of the biggest pranks on the list is Google\'s claim that it is launching a data center on Mars in 2018. The data center, named ""Ziggy Stardust,"" is designed as an off-world backup in case Earth experiences some sort of catastrophe. \n \n Image: google \n \n ""By opening a dedicated extraterrestrial cloud region, we\'re bringing the power of Google’s compute, network, and storage to the rest of the solar system, unlocking a plethora of possibilities for astronomy research, exploration of Martian natural resources and interplanetary life sciences,"" reads the very long and detailed blog post accompanying the April Fools\' gag. \n \n They even went as far as creating a data center location on Google Maps that you can explore. \n \n And while this may be a joke now, it\'s not unrealistic to imagine a very real Google data center on Mars in the decades ahead as companies like SpaceX work to colonize the red planet. \n \n Google Maps Ms. Pac-Man \n \n Finally, Google updated an old Google maps twist from 2015 by re-introducing its Pac-Man Google Maps game. In the current updated version on Android and iOS, you play Ms. Pac-Man using a map from anywhere in the world. \n \n Image: GOOGLE \n \n It\'s obvious why Google decided to rehash this one, it\'s incredibly addictive and deserves another look. Find your own neighborhood and try playing ""just one"" game and putting it down. \n \n So far, this looks like all the April Fools\' Day weirdness Google has up its collective sleeve, but we’ll keep our eyes open out for any new ones and add them as we find them.', 'In a year when every day feels like a cruel joke, it isn\'t really the time for April Fools\' Day. \n \n Maybe brands subconsciously realize that, because their April Fools\' Day pranks this year are pretty tame. At least they\'re amusing themselves with fake ways to watch TV and hail cars. \n \n Here are the notable ones so far: \n \n Amazon Petlexa \n \n Petlexa: Alexa, for your cat. Petlexa, ""allows dogs, cats, and other animals to communicate with Alexa just like you do."" Great! \n \n Netflix Live \n \n Image: screenshot/netflix \n \n Netflix uploaded its April Fools\' Day prank a day early and then canceled it the day of. \n \n Netflix Live starred Will Arnett narrating footage of microwaves and copiers. Even though the joke is under the category ""Recently Canceled by Netflix,"" you can still watch it. \n \n Hulu\'s Hu \n \n Hulu went with a commentary on patience this April Fools\' Day. Hu: TV Abbreviated shows you ""your favorite shows, all in eight seconds or less."" \n \n Click on the banner introducing the service to watch condensed clips of The Mindy Project, Seinfeld, Empire and other shows Hulu has streaming rights to. \n \n Lyft\'s Mono \n \n A few days early, Lyft rolled out Mono — a wearable that hails a Lyft for you when you raise your hand in the air (like raising your hand would do if you were hailing an actual taxi). \n \n Lyft quickly admitted the wearable was a prank, but the company did get Bella Hadid to try one out. #GetMono \n \n Learn Emoji with Duolingo \n \n Duolingo, the app that promises to teach you a language in five minutes a day, has a pretty fun proposition for April Fools. Today, the app will teach you how to speak emoji. \n \n If you have family members who are all over the place with their emoji usage (or don\'t use them at all), maybe they should check it out. Take a break from the Japanese lessons! \n \n Google \n \n Google has so many April Fools\' Day jokes it needs its own list. \n \n So far, you can play Ms. Pac-Man on Google Maps, get a ""Google Gnome"" instead of a Google Home, and control the weather with windmills if you\'re using Google Netherlands.', 'Live long and prank them. \n \n ""Star Trek"" star George Takei had everyone fooled early Saturday morning when he tweeted that he was running for Congress in California against Devin Nunes in 2018. \n \n ""Well, the cat\'s out of the bag it seems.

"[""A new study suggests the biblical account of the commanded annihilation of the ancient Canaanite people at the hands of the invading Israelites was a bit premature, claiming their descendants are still living just up the road, across the Lebanese border. \n \n New genetic research from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute has found that far from being destroyed, the Canaanites morphed into the inhabitants of modern Lebanon. \n \n Scientists in the United Kingdom-based genetic research center sequenced the genomes of five 4,000-year-old Canaanite individuals and compared them to other ancient and present-day populations, including a sample of 99 modern Lebanese. \n \n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up \n \n The results, published July 27 in the American Journal of Human Genetics, show that 93 percent of the ancestry of modern Lebanese ancestry comes from the Canaanites. \n \n Had they been destroyed by the Israelites, who were commanded by God to annihilate them, it would have been a form of patricide. According to the study, the Canaanites were the common ancestor for several ancient peoples who inhabited the Levant during the Bronze Age, such as the Ammonites, Moabites, and Israelites. \n \n “Each achieved their own cultural identities but all shared a common genetic and ethnic root with Canaanites,” according to the authors of the new study. \n \n “For the first time we have genetic evidence for substantial continuity in the region, from the Bronze Age Canaanite population through to the present day. These results agree with the continuity seen by archaeologists,” said Dr. Claude Doumet-Serhal, co-author and director of the Sidon excavation site in Lebanon. \n \n The Canaanites, like the Israelites a Semitic-speaking people, were at the center of Bronze Age civilization and “inhabited an area bounded by Anatolia to the north, Mesopotamia to the east, and Egypt to the south, with access to Cyprus and the Aegean through the Mediterranean,” according to the study. \n \n Mystery surrounds the fate of the Canaanites, who later came to be known as the Phoenicians, as they appear in scant historical records. Although they introduced several innovations into society, including the first alphabet, other than in the Hebrew Bible — where their annihilation is clearly commanded — there are a few mentions in ancient Egyptian and Greek texts. \n \n As reported in Science, Greek legend has it that the Canaanites originally came from the East. \n \n According to the study, the Canaanite-related ancestry “derived from mixture between local Neolithic populations and eastern migrants genetically related to Chalcolithic Iranians.” The scientists estimate, “using linkage-disequilibrium decay patterns,” that the genetic mixture took place between 6,600–3,550 years ago, “coinciding with recorded massive population movements in Mesopotamia.” \n \n Further, the Eurasian ancestry in the modern Lebanese genetic samples was not present in Bronze Age Canaanites or earlier Levantines. “We estimate that this Eurasian ancestry arrived in the Levant around 3,750–2,170 years ago during a period of successive conquests by distant populations,” write the scientists. \n \n Did a Canaanite genocide occur? \n \n In Deuteronomy 20:16, the ancient Israelites are commanded by God to completely wipe out the several Canaanite peoples after the death of the Hebrew leader Joshua. \n \n “But in the cities of these peoples that the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes, but you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the Lord your God has commanded.” \n \n However, according to the report, archaeological evidence does not support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages. For example, coastal cities such as Sidon and Tyre “show continuity of occupation until the present day.” \n \n In one of the later books of the Bible, the Canaanite’s continuity is detailed, in spite of the earlier commandment for their annihilation. In Judges 3:1-3, it is described how the commandment was given so that the Israelites may learn warfare, but that remnants of the Canaanite peoples were allowed to exist, including “the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon…” \n \n The analysis of the DNA from five Canaanite skeletons found in Sidon who lived 4,000 years ago, and comparison with modern day Lebanese, paint a picture much different than the annihilation recorded in the Bible. \n \n “It was a pleasant surprise to be able to extract and analyze DNA from 4,000-year-old human remains found in a hot environment, which is not known for preserving DNA well,” said Dr. Marc Haber, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Haber said the team overcame the climate’s challenge by taking samples from the petrous bone in the skull, which is a very tough bone with a high density of ancient DNA. \n \n “Genetic studies using ancient DNA can expand our understanding of history, and answer questions about the likely origins and descendants of enigmatic populations like the Canaanites, who left few written records themselves,” said Dr. Chris Tyler-Smith, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. \n \n “The overlap between the Bronze Age and present-day Levantines suggests a degree of genetic continuity in the region,” according to the study."", ""When people in a business negotiation share not just a meal but a plate, they collaborate better and reach deals faster, according to new ... \n \n A new study found workplace incivilities has the potential to not only negatively affect an employee's sleep but their partner's as ... \n \n Less data-sharing among firms can actually lead to more collusion, economists ... \n \n Men with dyslexia have altered structural connections between the thalamus and auditory cortex on the left side of the brain, new research reveals.

Per a study in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers from the UK's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute sequenced the genomes of five 4,000-year-old Canaanites, as well as 99 people now residing in Lebanon—DNA evidence that enabled the scientists to establish ancestry. The study results show an overwhelming majority of the genetic makeup (93%) of today's Lebanese can be traced back to the Canaanites, per the Times of Israel. Study co-author Chris Tyler-Smith calls that percentage ""quite surprising,"" given the ""enormously complex history of this region,"" per ScienceDaily. The Bible's Book of Deuteronomy lays out what was to happen to the Canaanites: ""Completely destroy them ... as the Lord your God has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do."" But some Bible verses contradict the story of total annihilation, and the researchers write that ""no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages."" The Canaanites made a major cultural impact during the Bronze Age, including introducing what's believed to have been the first alphabet. This new discovery sheds a bit more light on the rather mysterious group, who didn't leave much in the way of written records. (This find could reveal the truth about Goliath's people.)"
"['Free Online Training! \n \n Chances are your parenting is perfectly fine and working the way you would like. But if you have any frustrations with your child or would like improve your effectiveness in changing your child’s behavior, this training course will be a very useful guide. \n \n Everyday Parenting: The ABCs of Child Rearing gives you access to a toolkit of behavior-change techniques that will make your typical day in the home easier as you develop the behaviors you would like to see in your child. The lessons provide step-by-step instructions and demonstrations to improve your course of action with both children and adolescents. Among many techniques, you will learn how even simple modifications to tone of voice and phrasing can lead to more compliance. The key to the course and learning the techniques is practice. It is not enough to know the strategies; you have to do them to reap the rewards. Using the techniques on a temporary basis can lead to permanent change. Apart from the techniques, the course will also shed light on many parenting misconceptions and ineffective strategies that are routinely used. \n \n Here is a sample of what you will learn \n \n How to Register \n \n The Everyday Parenting: The ABCs of Child Rearing course is now available on Coursera for free*. Coursera provides online instruction through recorded videos and lectures taught by instructors from universities and educational institutions around the world. To sign up simply: \n \n Go to the Coursera website and create an account Search for “Everyday Parenting: The ABCs of Child Rearing“ Click on the “Enroll” button and choose Audit You will be brought to the page and can begin at any time. \n \n *You can earn a Course Certificate for a nominal fee.', 'Dr. Kazdin promotes a program called the ABCs, which stands for antecedents, behaviors and consequences. The antecedent is the setup, telling a child, specifically, what you want them to do before you want them to do it. Behaviors are where the behavior is defined and shaped, modeled by the parent. And the consequence involves an expression of approval when that behavior is performed, an over-the top Broadway-style belt-it-to-the-back-row expression of praise with an accompanying physical gesture of approval. \n \n So instead of yelling at your kid every night for the shoes strewn across the floor, ask him in the morning if he can put his shoes away when he comes home. Make sure when you come home that you put your own shoes away. And if your child puts his shoes away, or even puts them closer to where they’re supposed to be, tell him that he did a great job and then hug him. \n \n The ABC method of praise is a highly specific technique. You have to be effusive, so you actually have to put a big dumb smile on your face and even wave your hands in the air. Next thing is you have to say, in a very high, cheerful voice, exactly what you’re praising. And then the third part is you have to touch the child and give him some kind of nonverbal praise. The silliness is a feature, not a bug. It makes the kid notice the praise that accompanies correct behavior. And that’s the point. \n \n “We want to build habits,” Dr. Kazdin said. “The practice actually changes the brain, and in the process of that, the behaviors that you want to get rid of, having all kinds of temper tantrums and all the fights, all that just disappears.” Furthermore, he noted, “as a side effect, when you do these things, the parents’ depression and stress in fact go down and family relations pick up.” \n \n If our kids behave better, then we won’t feel like yelling. And if we don’t yell, our kids will behave better.']",2,"– In the 1960s, 94% of parents used physical punishment on their children. In 2010, just 22% of parents did. Parents have figured out that there's a better way than spanking—and now it's time for yelling to experience that same reckoning. Most parents today yell at their kids, and in the New York Times, Stephen Marche calls the practice ""the most widespread parental stupidity around today."" Studies have found that shouting at kids can lead to increases in anxiety, stress, depression, and behavioral problems and decreases in self-esteem. It makes parents look out of control and weak, and all it accomplishes is teaching kids to yell themselves. ""Yelling, even more than spanking, is the response of a person who doesn’t know what else to do,"" Marche writes—before explaining what else you can do. He highlights the ABCs of parenting, a process that does require advance planning: A: antecedents. Instead of yelling at your children every time they leave their shoes strewn around the room, clearly explain to them what you want them to do—before you want them to do it. In this case, talk to them in the morning about putting their shoes away when they come home from school. B: behaviors. Define, shape, and model the behavior you want. Put your own shoes away, and help your kids understand what to do. C: consequences. When your child puts his or her shoes away, or even gets them closer to where they're supposed to go, go over-the-top with praise, both verbal and nonverbal (touching). ""The beauty of having a system is that instead of reacting after your kids do something bad, instead of waiting for them to mess up and then getting angry, you have a conscious plan,"" writes Marche. His full explanation of the system is here."
"['One Woman\'s Quest To Make Juneteenth A National Holiday \n \n A 90-year-old Texas woman is trying to make ""Juneteenth,"" a holiday that honors the freedom of slaves, a national holiday. She\'s walked around the country and will end her petition in Washington, D.C. \n \n MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: \n \n This week, thousands of Americans are getting ready to visit Washington, D.C., to attend the inauguration or protests or other events. But we want to introduce you to a woman from Fort Worth, Texas, who\'s planning a special visit to the nation\'s capitol for a different reason. \n \n OPAL LEE: I kept telling family and friends that wanted to do it, and I think they thought, well, she\'s delusional. \n \n MARTIN: That\'s Opal Lee. She is on a quest to make June 19 a federal holiday. If you know your American history, then you know that June 19 is known as Juneteenth. It marks the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, and brought news that slavery had been abolished some two and a half years earlier. Oh, and let me just mention Opal Lee is 91 years old. \n \n LEE: I just thought if a little, old lady in tennis shoes was out there walking, somebody would take notice. \n \n MARTIN: It started out as a simple walk around her church in Fort Worth. \n \n LEE: But I got together some people here. We had a rally, and so after the rally, the people walked with me, and we\'ve been going ever since. \n \n MARTIN: Now she\'s made her Juneteenth walk throughout the country from Texas to Colorado to Illinois. Her last stop is the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Even though, some 45 states recognize Juneteenth in some way or another, she says the holiday is so important it should be recognized as a federal holiday. \n \n LEE: Slaves didn\'t free themselves. There were abolitionists and people of all persuasions that worked untiringly to have slavery abolished. \n \n MARTIN: Opal Lee has been trying to get President Obama to make Juneteenth a national holiday before he leaves office. But as that date draws near, she says, she hasn\'t gotten any sign that the president\'s onboard. But she\'s not discouraged. \n \n LEE: I have no idea, but I\'ll be trying. \n \n MARTIN: And she says she will keep pushing to make Juneteenth a national holiday when Donald Trump becomes president. \n \n Copyright © 2017 NPR.

Opal Lee, 90, set out from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, in September with a single goal: a long walk, with a final stop in Washington, DC, where she wants to present her petition to President Obama calling for a federal holiday on June 19. That's the day—""Juneteenth""—that Union soldiers came to Texas in 1865 with the news that slavery had been abolished more than two years earlier. What started out as a stroll around Lee's church last August mushroomed into something bigger. ""The people walked with me, and we've been going ever since,"" Lee tells NPR. ""I just thought if a little, old lady in tennis shoes was out there walking, somebody would take notice."" She was right. Invitations started coming, and Lee was happy to take them—in states ranging from Colorado and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Virginia, in a quest to add 100,000 signatures to her petition. ""I walk wherever I’m invited,"" Lee told CBS Pittsburgh during a stop in November. ""Two and a half miles in the morning and two and a half in the afternoon to symbolize that slaves were later told that they were free."" Lee, who collects donations on GoFundMe, is due in the nation's capital next week, where she hopes to make her case to Obama and lawmakers. Although 45 states count Juneteenth as a holiday, Lee says federal recognition is important. ""It would be the oldest holiday of significance for black people in these United States, so it needs to be observed and celebrated,"" she tells Fox4. ""Slaves didn't free themselves,"" she adds, per NPR. ""There were abolitionists and people of all persuasions that worked untiringly to have slavery abolished."" And if her pitch falls short next week? There's a new president coming and Lee plans to keep pushing with him. (Dallas once voted on slavery reparations.)"
"['Donald Trump hasn’t even taken office yet, but the racist alt-right movement that has latched onto him is already showing signs that it’s falling apart. \n \n The loosely knit group was shocked to the core Saturday night when one of its most influential leaders -- a man known to his online followers as ""Mike Enoch,"" a virulent racist and anti-Semite -- was revealed to be a New York website developer named Mike Peinovich, who has said that his wife is Jewish. \n \n Enoch/Peinovich is the creator of the popular neo-Nazi website The Right Stuff (TRS). For several years, he has also co-hosted a podcast called “The Daily Shoah,” a deliberately offensive pun on the Hebrew term for the Holocaust. \n \n In his online persona, Peinovich routinely cracked jokes about killing Jewish people and forcibly deporting Muslims and people of African descent. The weekly program had roughly 100,000 regular listeners, many of whom regularly sent in financial donations by PayPal or bought merchandise from the site. \n \n Peinovich\'s wife appears to have been aware of the entire situation. She even appeared on ""The Daily Shoah"" several times, including a special holiday-season segment in 2015 where she read a neo-Nazi parody of ""The Night Before Christmas."" Introducing the clip, which can be found online, Peinovich said his wife was ""very proud of it."" \n \n Peinovich’s doxxing --- a term referring to revealing someone’s private information online --- was largely the work of anonymous left-wing users on the Medium blog site, in a post that has since been deleted. Word spread like wildfire throughout the alt-right’s many web forums and message boards over the weekend, as TRS fans and detractors battled over whether the information was legitimate or not. \n \n That initial report had an air of credibility, since the identities of Peinovich’s fellow “death panelists” on the podcast had been revealed earlier in the week. That doxxing was done by anti-fascist activists who call themselves ""antifas"" and also members of a rival far right website called 8chan, who attacked TRS for supporting the principle that non-Jewish white nationalists had common interests with extreme right-wing Israelis, which is anathema to hardcore neo-Nazis and anti-Semites. \n \n The first of Peinovich’s colleagues who was doxxed was a University of Nebraska philosophy student who called himself “Ghoul."" His information was leaked out by antifas; 8channers subsequently revealed that his mother was revealed to be married to another woman. \n \n After that, 8channers and and antifas doxxed the rest of the “Daily Shoah” crew. “Bulbasaur” was exposed as a corrections officer living in Tennessee and “Seventh Son” was revealed as a guitarist in a New York-based rock band. \n \n The big prize for the doxxers, however, was Peinovich. As the creator of TRS, he was (at least until this weekend) regarded as one of the three most influential figures in the alt-right, alongside Daily Stormer creator Andrew Anglin and Richard Spencer, the co-creator of the ""alt-right"" label. \n \n Though TRS has not received as much coverage in the mainstream press, it originated or popularized many alt-right pranks and memes, including the practice of identifying Jewish people or those suspected of being Jewish with (((triple sets of parentheses))), bogus White Student Union schemes at educational institutions, and racist or anti-Semitic song parodies. Peinovich has also claimed he was the first person to give a Nazi salute at the infamous National Policy Institute conference after Trump\'s election in November. \n \n Peinovich’s downfall was set in motion in December when a former alt-right vlogger named Mike Cernovich hinted to his viewers that one of his rivals “is morbidly obese and is married to a Jewish woman.” He declined to say who he meant, but that salacious rumor set the cyber-sleuths to their task. \n \n As the doxxing unfolded this weekend, Peinovich said nothing on Twitter or on his own site. Contacted via email by Salon, he denied being Mike Enoch but admitted to having been involved with TRS. \n \n “I was involved with that site years ago, writing a few libertarian articles for them and using my PayPal for the exactly zero donations that the site ever got when it was still a libertarian blog,” he wrote. \n \n Peinovich then claimed he had disassociated himself from TRS after it became overtly pro-Nazi: “I cut off ties when they went the direction they are going now, and that was 4 years ago. Honestly I have not thought much about them. As you can see from all public writings I am libertarian. My wife is Jewish. Do you really believe that I am this person?” \n \n The TRS creator then asked Salon to help him deny that he was Enoch: “If you give any fucks at all then you could print that this is all bullshit. We are now being harassed not only by communists but by actual neo nazis.” \n \n When asked if he would be willing to conduct a telephone interview, Peinovich replied, “Let me talk to my wife.” He never answered back. \n \n As the evidence continued to mount linking him to the Enoch identity, Peinovich decided to fess up to his devoted Nazi fans in a post for TRS’ password-protected forums, part of which read: \n \n As I am sure you all know, I was doxxed and an ill advised attempt to fool the media about my identity led me to not talk to you people and to try to simply ride it out by being silent. This was irresponsible and a disservice to all of you. Yes my wife is who they say she is, I won\'t even bother denying it, I won\'t bother making excuses. If this makes you want to leave the movement, or to have nothing to do with TRS, then I understand. Don\'t lie for me. Don\'t try to defend me to those attacking me. Don\'t jeopardize your own reputation by defending things that you don\'t think you can. I could try to explain my whole life for the last ten years to you but what difference at this point would it make. Life isn\'t perfect. \n \n The admission sent a shock wave throughout the alt-right. The reactions began pouring in. Some listeners of “The Daily Shoah” were crestfallen. Here\'s just one example of the anguish: \n \n TDS was my favorite podcast and one of the best parts of my week. Enoch\'s rants were both enlightening and triggering, but now I cannot listen to them the same way again. It just feels like they\'re just more actors in the same play being orchestrated by the Jews. Half of my gut has also thought TRS has been controlled opposition for awhile now. Although I will continue to listen to the Shoah I just don\'t know if I will be able to take Enoch as seriously as I used to. It\'s pretty bad for your WN, fourth reich, neo-nazi, facist movement when one of the head guys happens to be married to a Jew. \n \n Within a few more hours, Peinovich’s partners announced that he was resigning from TRS entirely. \n \n The 8channers, who pride themselves on their refusal to adopt pseudonyms (all site users post under the handle “Anonymous”) and reject the ""alt-right"" label in favor of ""national socialist,"" were ecstatic. \n \n “(((TRS))) is over. Period,” gloated one of them. \n \n Many began improvising some of the Holocaust memes that have been lobbed at Jewish journalists, instead featuring Peinovich and his wife. Both were depicted in gas chambers before the night was done. \n \n Another hoped the entire alt-right movement would just disappear: “After the shitstorm is over the alt-right won’t be important enough to warrant a [discussion] thread,” he wrote. “In my opinion, they never did.” \n \n With Peinovich gone and many TRS readers mistrustful of the “death panelists” who helped him cover up his secret, the site’s future is an open question. Its unique blend of pop-culture references and hardcore neo-Nazism will be hard to replace. By around 3:30 on Sunday morning, at least some 8channers had begun to feel a sense of regret. \n \n ""I\'m going to bed but I want everyone involved with this doxxing to think about contributing something to replace TRS rather than pissing on its grave and saying that they did the right thing,” wrote one of them. “So far you have fucked up royally.” \n \n This article has been updated to reflect the fact that anti-fascist activists were the first to expose Ghoul, not 8chan posters. \n \n Matthew Sheffield A writer, web developer, and former tv producer, Matthew Sheffield covers politics, media, and technology for Salon.

Sorry.” \n \n On Monday, Spencer said on Twitter: “I respect, like, and admire Mike Enoch. He will continue to be a force on the Alt Right in the future.” \n \n The same day, Peinovich’s podcast partners said he had quit the Right Stuff. \n \n \n \n The Right Stuff serves as a hub for the far right and publishes podcasts including The Daily Shoah and Fash the Nation. The site claims tens of thousands of listeners. Before it was banned from Soundcloud last October, Fash the Nation was the No1 conservative podcast on the platform. \n \n The Right Stuff has been instrumental in evolving the distinctive lexicon of the far right, notably originating the “echoes” meme in which Jewish names are enclosed in three closed parentheses. This was listed as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League last year. \n \n In its Medium post, counter-countersignal accused the Right Stuff of taking “alt-right politics to their logical conclusion, including favorable references to the Holocaust, ethnic cleansing, gaybashing, Islamophobic hate crimes, police shootings of black youth, and much more”. \n \n The group justified the doxxing by claiming the website was “central to a hard-core, explicitly neo-Nazi tendency in the alt-right movement”. \n \n Antifascist sources said the investigation had proceeded with online intelligence, supplemented with offline checking of Enoch’s address and his wife’s identity. Counter-countersignal said that there was “no hacking or illegal activity involved”. \n \n 'Alt-right' groups will 'revolt' if Trump shuns white supremacy, leaders say Read more \n \n In an email, the group provided its reasons for targeting Enoch. \n \n “[The Right Stuff] posts podcasts and articles advocating for the murder of people of color, queers, leftists, and a new holocaust against Jews on a daily basis,” the email read. “For the most part they would not be saying this stuff if they had any accountability from their neighbors, friends, and family.” \n \n Writers and podcasters at the Right Stuff usually operate under pseudonyms. In recent weeks, other doxxings have led some far-right figures to go into hiding. \n \n A Scottish YouTube star known as Millennial Woes, who appeared at the National Policy Institute, has reportedly left the country after attracting mainstream media interest.

Peinovich's wife appeared on the Daily Shoah podcast numerous times. In one 2015 episode, she read a neo-Nazi parody of The Night Before Christmas of which she was ""very proud,"" Peinovich said at the time. If her Jewish heritage ""makes you want to leave the movement, or to have nothing to do with TRS, then I understand,"" Peinovich wrote on the TRS forum this week.

"['(HealthDay News) -- Babies process and preserve memories during those many naps they take during the day, a new study suggests. ""We discovered that sleeping shortly after learning helps infants to retain memories over extended periods of time,"" said study author Sabine Seehagen, a child and adolescent psychology researcher with Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. ""In both of our experiments, only those infants who took an extended nap for at least half an hour within four hours after learning remembered the information."" The study doesn\'t definitively confirm that the naps themselves help the memories stick, but the researchers believe that is happening. ""While people might assume that infants learn best when they are wide awake, our findings suggest that the time just before infants go down for sleep can be a particularly valuable learning opportunity,"" Seehagen said. Scientists have long linked more sleep to better memory, but it\'s been unclear what happens when babies spend a significant amount of time sleeping. \n \n In the new study, researchers launched two experiments. In each one, babies aged 6 months or 12 months were taught how to remove mittens from animal puppets. Then some of the babies took a nap for a half-hour and some didn\'t. A total of 216 babies were tested. \n \n Then the researchers tested the babies to see if they remembered how to remove the mittens either four or 24 hours later. \n \n The researchers found that only the babies who\'d taken naps after learning actually remembered what they\'d learned, especially after 24 hours. \n \n Study author Seehagen said it\'s ""quite unlikely"" that the babies who didn\'t nap remember less because they were tired. Still, she said more research is needed to confirm the results. \n \n So, how many naps do babies need and how long should they be? \n \n ""The small number of studies makes it difficult to make firm recommendations to parents,"" said Angela Lukowski, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine. \n \n However, ""the lesson for parents seems to be that napping after learning may help infants remember information over time,"" she said. She added that naps of at least 30 minutes seem to be helpful, although there hasn\'t been much, if any, research into shorter naps. \n \n As for adults, don\'t worry about napping as a memory aid. ""There are many studies in the literature showing the benefit of naps for adults, but adults do not need to nap to retain new memories,"" said Rebecca Gomez, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Arizona. \n \n The new study is published in this week\'s issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n More information \n \n Visit Harvard Medical School\'s Healthy Sleep website for more about sleep, learning and memory.', 'Because most babies at those ages are not yet talking, the researchers had to find a nonverbal way to measure how the timing of sleep influenced the strength of a memory. Four furry puppets--two resembling mice and two resembling rabbits, each wearing a detachable felt mitten on one hand--helped researchers infer whether or not a baby had successfully committed his or her experience with the puppets to memory and stored that information for later use.', 'The potential benefits of infant sleep for memory processing are largely unexplored. Here we show evidence that having an extended nap (≥30 min) within 4 h of learning helps 6- and 12-month-old infants to retain their memories for new behaviors across a 4- and 24-h delay. These results suggest that infants rely on frequent naps for the formation of long-term memories. \n \n Abstract \n \n Human infants devote the majority of their time to sleeping. However, very little is known about the role of sleep in early memory processing. Here we test 6- and 12-mo-old infants’ declarative memory for novel actions after a 4-h [Experiment (Exp.) 1] and 24-h delay (Exp. 2). Infants in a nap condition took an extended nap (≥30 min) within 4 h after learning, whereas infants in a no-nap condition did not. A comparison with age-matched control groups revealed that after both delays, only infants who had napped after learning remembered the target actions at the test. Additionally, after the 24-h delay, memory performance of infants in the nap condition was significantly higher than that of infants in the no-nap condition. This is the first experimental evidence to our knowledge for an enhancing role of sleep in the consolidation of declarative memories in the first year of life.']",3,"– It's long been thought that napping is an important part of a baby's growth—both physically and mentally. Now new research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that naps help babies form new memories, and that when a nap directly follows a new activity the baby is far likelier to recall it the next day than if that child doesn't nap until four hours after the activity, reports the Los Angeles Times. ""In both of our experiments, only those infants who took an extended nap for at least half an hour within four hours after learning remembered the information,"" the study's lead author tells HealthDay News. To test a baby's recall, researchers studied 216 babies ages 6 months and 12 months. They demonstrated how to remove mittens from animal puppets, and found that those who then took naps at least 30 minutes long (and typically more like 80) were better able to recall how to remove the mittens 24 hours later than those who didn't nap until four hours later. Whether a baby napped just before the experiment made no difference. The authors also hypothesize that because the hippocampal region—key to memory formation—is so small in babies, it may only be able to store smaller chunks of information, hence the need for frequent sleep early in life. (Other research shows a newborn's brain grows 1% a day.)"

"['A troubled patient opened fire on a caseworker and psychiatrist in a small office at a unit of Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Delaware County on Thursday afternoon, police said, leading the doctor to draw his own weapon and shoot the assailant. \n \n The confrontation left the caseworker, 53-year-old Theresa Hunt, dead and the 52-year-old psychiatrist, a veteran doctor at the hospital whom sources identified as Lee Silverman, with a graze wound to the head. The patient, Richard Plotts, was in critical condition Thursday night from three gunshot wounds. \n \n The violence sent a shock wave through the normally quiet campus of the medical center on the border of Darby Borough and Yeadon. Police vehicles swarmed the scene and armed officers charged through the building - the Sister Marie Lenahan Wellness Center, across Lansdowne Avenue from the main hospital - to evacuate doctors, nurses, and patients waiting for routine appointments. \n \n Authorities said they believed Silverman shot Plotts three times in the torso and arm. Silverman was expected to be released from the hospital Thursday night and recover fully. \n \n Plotts, of Upper Darby, who appeared to have a long criminal record, was undergoing surgery Thursday night at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. If he survives, he will be charged Friday with murder, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said. \n \n It was not clear why Silverman, a doctor for nearly 25 years, was armed at the office. Bernice Ho, a spokeswoman for Mercy Fitzgerald, said Thursday it was against hospital policy for anyone other than security guards to carry weapons. \n \n Donald Molineux, chief of the Yeadon Police Department, said that if Silverman returned fire and wounded Plotts, he ""without a doubt saved lives."" \n \n Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital called the incident ""a tragic event for our hospital and for our community,"" and said its community was praying for the victims. \n \n ""We are grateful for the efforts of the emergency responders, and we are working with the Delaware County police departments to understand fully the details of the event and to do all we can to assist those affected,"" hospital officials said in a statement. \n \n Founded in 1933 by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Mercy Fitzgerald is a 213-bed hospital that serves more than 186,000 patients each year. \n \n Why Plotts was there was unclear. Whelan said Plotts has a history of psychiatric problems. \n \n Court records show that a Delaware County man matching his name and age - authorities said Plotts was in his mid- to late 40s - was sentenced in 1996 to more than seven years in prison for robbing a bank in Wilmington. Other court records show that an Upper Darby man with the same name and age has been arrested numerous times over the last 30 years for assault, drugs, weapons possession, and other offenses. \n \n On Thursday, Whelan described how the meeting among Plotts, Silverman, and Hunt abruptly took a violent turn. \n \n Plotts and Hunt went to Silverman\'s third-floor office shortly before 2:30 p.m., Whelan said. Plotts was apparently armed, Whelan said, and people near the room soon heard shouting. \n \n Concerned, a hospital employee ""actually opened the door, saw him pointing a gun at the doctor,"" Whelan said. The worker shut the door quietly and immediately called 911. \n \n Plotts then opened fire. According to Whelan, he shot Hunt two times in the face. The psychiatrist then ducked under his desk, retrieved his gun, and came up shooting, striking Plotts three times. \n \n Staff members rushed toward the scene. Plotts ended up in the hallway, and another caseworker and a doctor tackled and pinned him, Whelan said. \n \n As police arrived, the building was being evacuated and placed in a lockdown. Patients and doctors streamed onto the lawn and driveways surrounding the building, which contains offices for outpatient services, including pediatrics, cardiology, pulmonary care, and psychiatry. \n \n Allen Williams of Upper Darby was handing over his identification and health card for his X-Ray appointment when police officers rushed into the lobby. \n \n ""They came in with guns drawn,"" he said. ""It was just a shock to me."" \n \n Alfred Williams said he had just left a doctor\'s appointment and was waiting for a ride home when, suddenly, swarms of police officers descended on the scene. \n \n ""They kept coming,"" Williams said. ""Guys with helmets and automatic weapons kept jumping out of their cars. It was total panic. . . . I saw three people come out in stretchers."" \n \n Anna Smith, an ultrasound technician, was on the first floor of the building celebrating a colleague\'s 60th birthday when police burst in and told everyone to leave through the back door, she said. \n \n ""There\'s a sign on the door that says you have to check your weapons at the front,"" she said. ""But you can\'t expect every crazy person to do that."" \n \n Former neighbors at Plotts\' apartment building along West Chester Pike in Upper Darby said Plotts was an uneasy presence in the neighborhood until he moved out sometime in the last year. The tall, solidly built Plotts seemed like he was either ""on drugs or heavily medicated,"" said Bert Garcia. \n \n ""He was a big guy,"" Garcia said. ""He could be intimidating."" \n \n Once, before he moved out, Garcia found that he had removed some ceiling tiles in the hallway and was messing around with the wiring. Another time, he told Garcia he had stabbed himself in the leg - but Garcia saw no blood. \n \n ""You could tell there was something wrong,"" neighbor Cathy Nickel said.

"['(Washington Post Staff Photo/Andrea Bruce) \n \n Just one glass of wine or other alcoholic drink a day significantly raises the risk of breast cancer, while vigorous exercise such as running and bicycling reduces it, according to an expansive review of research on the effects of diet, nutrition and physical activity on the disease. \n \n The report, which was issued Tuesday, concluded that drinking the equivalent of one small glass of wine, beer or other alcohol a day — about 10 grams of alcohol — is linked to an increased cancer risk of 5 percent for pre-menopausal women and 9 percent for post-menopausal women. A standard drink has 14 grams of alcohol. \n \n ""This suggests there is no level of alcohol use that is completely safe in terms of breast cancer,"" said Anne McTiernan, a cancer-prevention researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and one of the report\'s lead authors. ""If a woman is drinking, it would be better if she kept it to a lower amount."" \n \n The review, by the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and the World Cancer Research Fund, evaluated research in 119 studies encompassing data on 12 million women from around the world. It is the first such review since 2010, the groups said. \n \n For the first time, researchers concluded evidence is strong that vigorous exercise reduces breast-cancer risk. Pre-menopausal women who were the most active had a 17 percent lower risk of developing malignancies compared to the least active women, while post-menopausal women had a 10 percent decreased risk. \n \n [For women, heavy drinking has been normalized. That\'s dangerous.] \n \n The researchers noted that many things influence cancer risk and that women can\'t control factors such as a family history of cancer. But, McTiernan said, ""having a physically active lifestyle, maintaining a healthy weight throughout life and limiting alcohol — these are all steps women can take to lower their risk."" \n \n At the same time, she said, a healthy lifestyle is not a guarantee. Rather, it\'s more like wearing a seat belt. Many women will do everything they can to reduce their risks of breast cancer but still get diagnosed. ""That\'s unfortunate, but that\'s what happens,"" she said. \n \n Researchers were not able to calculate the degree to which vigorous exercise might cut the risk of alcohol consumption. What happens, for example, if a regular drinker also runs daily? \n \n ""The mechanism suggests that it could be helpful,"" McTiernan said. Alcohol increases estrogen, which is linked to increased breast-cancer risk, while physical activity reduces it. ""But I can\'t say that for someone who drinks five drinks and then runs, that the exercise is going to negate the adverse effects of the alcohol."" \n \n The report found women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of post-menopausal disease. \n \n ""If women lose just 10 percent of their weight, it\'s linked to reduced blood estrogen, inflammation"" and other factors associated with breast cancer, McTiernan said. \n \n The report also found limited evidence linking dairy foods, diets high in calcium and foods containing carotenoids to a lower risk of some breast cancers. Carotenoids include such fruits and vegetables as kale, apricots and carrots. \n \n About 252,000 women in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. AICR estimates that 1 in 3 cases could be prevented if women did not drink alcohol, were physically active and maintained a healthy weight. \n \n Read more: \n \n Women with advanced breast cancer are surviving longer, study says \n \n You just learned you have breast cancer.

That's the conclusion of a large-scale review by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research fund that took a closer look at 119 studies involving more than 12 million women globally, and the impact of nutrition, diet, and physical activity on breast cancer risk. Although a typical alcoholic beverage contains 14 grams of alcohol, the report finds that even a small glass of wine, beer, or spirits (one with as little as 10 grams of alcohol) is tied to a 5% increased cancer risk in pre-menopausal women and 9% in post-menopausal women, indicating there may be ""no level of alcohol use that is completely safe"" when it comes to breast cancer, Ann McTiernan, one of the study's lead authors, tells the Post. Some good news: Researchers also found exercise plays a role in one's risk level—specifically, ""vigorous"" exercise on a regular basis cut the risk of breast cancer for both pre-menopausal women (a 17% reduction) and post-menopausal women (a 10% cut). So what if you like to throw one back but also often hit the gym? McTiernan notes alcohol increases estrogen levels, which has been tied to breast cancer risk, and that exercise can tamp those levels down—though that doesn't necessarily mean it will cancel out alcohol's effects. Although a healthy lifestyle doesn't offer complete assurance that cancer will stay away—McTiernan compares it to wearing a seatbelt, per the Post—the AICR estimates that a third of US breast cancer cases could be avoided if women kept to a healthy weight, exercised regularly, and didn't drink. (Alcohol has been tied to at least half a dozen types of cancer.)"

Read more \n \n Researchers trained 29 rats on two different challenges: rats which successfully carried out the more difficult task earned two sugar pellets; those which carried out the easier task earned just one. \n \n Rats usually preferred the harder, but more rewarding, task. But after being dosed with THC, the same rats picked the easier task. \n \n CBD, which does not cause a high and is believed to have medicinal benefits such as relieving pain and the symptoms of epilepsy, had no impact on the rats’ cognitive behaviour. It also did not mitigate the cognitive impact of THC in the rats. \n \n \n \n The THC did not make the rats less intelligent – just lazier, said the study’s lead author, Mason Silveira, a PhD candidate in psychology at the University of British Columbia. \n \n \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest UBC researchers test effects of THC on rats \n \n “When rats were given THC – the active ingredient in cannabis or marijuana – we found that they were less likely to exert the mental energy needed to do more difficult tasks,” he said. \n \n \n \n “What’s particularly interesting is though they were less likely to do these more difficult tasks they were still able to. There’s this distinction between THC’s ability to affect your cognition versus your willingness to actually use your cognitive abilities.” \n \n \n \n Silveira said his work underscores the need for more research to determine the impact of THC on the human brain, to explore how any of those potential negative effects could be mitigated, and to look into the effect of other marijuana compounds other than CBD on THC’s impact. \n \n \n \n “Our research highlights that, yes, cannabis itself may be beneficial for a variety of things, but can maybe lead to these impairments in cognition that you might want to consider,” he said. \n \n \n \n A 2012 report by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse said there was “sound evidence” from both animal and clinical trials that medicinal marijuana can offer relief of nausea and vomiting and certain types of pain, but warned there was a lack of research documenting the risks associated with the medical use of cannabis.', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.', 'THC makes rats lazy, less willing to try cognitively demanding tasks: UBC study \n \n New research from the University of British Columbia suggests there may be some truth to the belief that marijuana use causes laziness— at least in rats. \n \n The study, published today in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, makes rats less willing to try a cognitively demanding task. \n \n “Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that when we gave THC to these rats, they basically became cognitively lazy,” said Mason Silveira, the study’s lead author and a PhD candidate in UBC’s department of psychology. “What’s interesting, however, is that their ability to do the difficult challenge was unaffected by THC. The rats could still do the task— they just didn’t want to.” \n \n For the study, researchers looked at the effects of both THC and cannabidiol (CBD) on rats’ willingness to exert cognitive effort. \n \n They trained 29 rats to perform a behavioural experiment in which the animals had to choose whether they wanted an easy or difficult challenge to earn sugary treats. \n \n Under normal circumstances, most rats preferred the harder challenge to earn a bigger reward. But when the rats were given THC, the animals switched to the easier option, despite earning a smaller reward. \n \n When they looked at the effect of CBD, an ingredient in marijuana that does not result in a high, researchers found the chemical did not have any effect on rats’ decision-making or attention. CBD, which is believed to be beneficial in treating pain, epilepsy and even cancer, also didn’t block the negative effects of THC. \n \n “This was surprising, as it had been suggested that high concentrations of CBD could modulate or reduce the negative effects of THC,” said Catharine Winstanley, senior author of the study and an associate professor in UBC’s department of psychology. “Unfortunately, that did not appear to be the case.” \n \n Given how essential willingness to exert cognitive effort is for people to achieve success, Winstanley said the findings underscore the importance of realizing the possible effect of cannabis use on impairing willingness to engage in harder tasks. \n \n While some people view marijuana as a panacea that can cure all ailments, the findings also highlight a need for more research to determine what THC does to the human brain to alter decision-making. That could eventually allow scientists to block these effects of THC, allowing those who use medical marijuana to enjoy the possible benefits of cannabis without the less desirable cognitive effects. \n \n METHOD \n \n At the beginning of each behavioural experiment, rats chose between two levers to signal whether they wanted an easy or hard challenge. \n \n Choosing the easy challenge resulted in a light turning on for one second, which the rats could easily detect and respond to by poking it with their nose, receiving one sugar pellet as a reward. In the more difficult challenge, the light turned on for only 0.2 seconds, rewarding the rat with two sugar pellets if they responded with a nose poke.']",3,"– Scientists, apparently bored with pert, productive rats, added a little marijuana to the equation and found that, as many a teenager can tell you, laziness ensued. So report researchers at the University of British Columbia in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience after concluding that male lab rats given TCH experience an observable reduction in their ""willingness to exert cognitive effort."" To test this, researchers trained 29 rats to choose whether they wanted to perform a more difficult task to earn a larger quantity of a sugary treat or perform an easier task but earn less of the treat. Without THC, most of the rats preferred to exert themselves for the greater reward; after the dose of THC, however, they largely chose the easier path and settled for a smaller treat, even though their ability to perform the harder task was not impacted. ""What’s particularly interesting is though they were less likely to do these more difficult tasks they were still able to,"" one researcher tells the Guardian, adding that there's a clear need for more research on how THC impacts the human brain, whether any negative side effects can be reduced, and whether marijuana compounds other than THC play a role. When the researchers gave the rats doses of the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol, or CBD, which is thought to have medical benefits such as pain relief and doesn't cause a high, they found that it didn't impact the rats' cognitive behavior, but it also didn't help mitigate the effects of THC on motivation.

Still, 80 mph in a sport-utility vehicle is pretty fast. \n \n At the time, Sheen was running nearly an hour late for his stage show, “Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option,” at DAR Constitution Hall. \n \n But you might wonder: Who authorized the D.C. police escort — at least two marked cars with emergency lights blazing — that helped the fired sitcom star and his entourage hurry into the District? \n \n How important or famous must one be — how much tiger blood and Adonis DNA must one possess — to rate a police motorcade in the nation’s capital? \n \n How is such a thing arranged? And what does it cost? \n \n You’ll have to wonder awhile longer: As of Thursday, 48 hours after Sheen had come and gone, no one in his camp or the police department would publicly explain the deployment of law enforcement resources. \n \n “Citizens of the District don’t want to see their police force used to escort private citizens and that Charlie Sheen, of all people, is getting a personal escort,” said D.C. Council member Phil Mendelson (D-At Large), chairman of the committee that oversees police. \n \n Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier did not reply to e-mailed questions. Sheen’s publicist and tour promoter said they had no answers. And a spokeswoman for Constitution Hall said the venerable venue had nothing to do with the actor’s commute. \n \n “This entire matter is under investigation,” D.C. police spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said Thursday, declining to answer questions about the escort. \n \n Such a murky affair. Try to follow along. . . . \n \n Although the D.C. police Web site describes how the department deals with visiting dignitaries, nothing could be found on it explaining how, say, a Hollywood celebrity running late for a stage gig can arrange a high-speed motor escort. \n \n “From what I know right now, I have asked internal affairs to investigate,” Lanier told reporter Paul Wagner of WTTG-TV (Channel 5) outside the city’s John A. Wilson Building. “Because, from what the allegation is, it is not something that’s authorized by the Metropolitan Police Department.” \n \n The department provides police escorts in “limited circumstances . . . based on security needs, and there are protocols to be followed,” the chief said. “We don’t do escorts for celebrities.” \n \n The department’s special events branch works on “planning, developing and executing escort and security support,” but only for “distinguished guests of the federal and municipal governments,” the site says. \n \n The phone in the special events branch rang and rang Thursday. No one answered, and there was no voice mail. The branch is part of the police homeland security bureau, which is commanded by Assistant Chief Lamar Greene. \n \n Greene said Thursday that he had not personally looked into the Sheen matter. “I know, of course, there’s a lot of inquiries floating around about it,” he said, adding that the department “has put together a fact sheet that will pretty much answer any- and everything you guys need to know.” \n \n Was the escort proper? “Oh, yes,” Greene said without elaborating. \n \n Asked about the fact sheet, Crump said: “Oh, that’s an internal document. That’s not something we’re putting out. . . . It’s part of our investigation.” \n \n Sheen, who was busy in Los Angeles with two court hearings Tuesday morning, including a child-custody dispute with estranged wife Brooke Mueller, arrived at Dulles that night on a private jet. It was still unclear Thursday whether the escort began at the airport in suburban Virginia. \n \n Mendelson said Lanier told him that the escort started outside the city. He said the chief was “very clearly caught off-guard” by news of Sheen’s ride. \n \n “[I]n car with Police escort in front and rear!” Sheen, 45, said in a message posted to his Twitter account (@charliesheen) as he and his posse were headed to the city in two SUVs. “[D]riving like someone’s about to deliver a baby! Cop car lights #Spinning!” \n \n Accompanying the tweet, which appears to have been deleted, was a photo taken in the SUV carrying Sheen, showing the speedometer needle at 80 mph, with the flashing strobe lights of the lead police car visible through the windshield. Sheen was quick to tell reporters about his fast ride into the city when he arrived at Constitution Hall. \n \n The show, scheduled to start at 8 p.m., was delayed for 57 minutes. “I just landed,” he told the waiting news media at the stage door. “We had a police escort, and we ran more red lights than Brooke Mueller heading to a pawn shop.” \n \n On Wednesday, when asked about the police cars, Crump described the deployment as routine. “This escort was handled as a reimbursable detail,” she said in an e-mail. “This means the government was reimbursed for the services provided.” \n \n The department’s Web site defines a “reimbursable detail” as one in which on-duty officers are posted at public events such as festivals and parades to direct traffic, control crowds and “ensure the safety of public patrons.” \n \n An event organizer is required to sign a letter of agreement beforehand, promising to reimburse the department for the cost of deploying officers. \n \n When Crump was asked how a TV star’s drive into the city from an airport fit the definition of “reimbursable detail,” she would only say that the matter is being investigated. \n \n Bren Landon, a spokeswoman for Constitution Hall, suggested that questions about the escort might best be put to Sheen’s handlers. \n \n “Constitution Hall operates under a four-wall rental, which means a promoter rents the venue, books the act, and then is responsible for all aspects of the show, including security, ticketing, ushering, etc.,” she said in an e-mail. \n \n Sheen’s tour promoter, Joey Scoleri of Live Nation, had no answers. “Please deal with Larry,” he said in an e-mail referring to Sheen’s publicist, Larry Solters. \n \n Solters was also no help. He said he was in Los Angeles on Tuesday. “I am in LA and was not aware of any arrangements,” his e-mail said. “Will check with our on site reps.” \n \n Then later: “Haven’t been able to get any info on this.” \n \n The mystery endures. \n \n Tuesday’s Washington performance marked the halfway point of Sheen’s 20-city show tour. On Thursday night, he was set to rant at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta. It wasn’t clear how fast he got to the stage door. An Atlanta police spokesman said the department “has not been asked to provide any escorts.”']",2,"– Charlie Sheen stirred up another controversy while in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night: He somehow managed to snag a police escort so he could book it at 80mph to his show, for which he was running almost an hour late. The Washington Post looks into the matter, but no one will say exactly how such a thing was arranged or who paid for it. A police spokesperson says it's ""under investigation."" Griped one DC council member, ""Citizens of the District don’t want to see their police force used to escort private citizens and that Charlie Sheen, of all people, is getting a personal escort."" Meanwhile, as Sheen himself told us, he’s “not bipolar,” he’s “bi-winning.” But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t care about those who are bipolar: He is donating $5,880 to the Calgary-based Organization for Bipolar Affective Disorders, the New York Daily News reports. That amount matches the amount his fans donated during an odd and somewhat controversial charity march Sheen staged in support of the group last week in Toronto, during which he sported a hat that said, “I’M NOT BIPOLAR.” A rep for the group calls the hat insulting, but says, “We’re happy to receive the funds.” (Click to read what Sheen announced he'd do if he was elected president.)"

Robert Bentley has apologized to the government of India for ""the unfortunate use of excessive force"" that left an Indian man partially paralyzed and in need of spinal surgery, AL.com reports. Officer Eric Parker allegedly slammed Sureshbhai Patel, 57, to the ground while he walked in Madison, where he was visiting his son and helping look after his grandson. ""I deeply regret"" the action and ""the injuries sustained by Mr. Patel,"" Bentley wrote in a letter to Consul General Ajit Kumar in Atlanta. ""I sincerely hope that Mr. Patel continues to improve and that he will regain full use of his legs."" Parker, 26, who was fired following the incident, pleaded not guilty to third-degree assault in writing yesterday. A bench trial is scheduled for April, AL.com reports. ""We will see that justice is done arising from the use of excessive force under color of state law upon a citizen of India,"" Bentley continued in the letter. Though the FBI is already investigating, Bentley also called on the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency to review the incident. Patel has since been moved from a hospital to a rehabilitation center, where his lawyer says he is recovering but still unable to walk, the Times of India reports. A GoFundMe page has raised more than $190,000 for his recovery. Meanwhile, Patel's lawyer has filed a federal lawsuit claiming Madison police used excessive force and weren't authorized to search Patel. He says the incident wasn't race related but is instead ""about police abuse of power and police accountability."""

"['Watching President Barack Obama play the race card late last week in the matter of the Zimmerman trial reminded me that the guy from Chicago has truly amazing powers. \n \n He stood in the White House briefing room, and through the magic of his own silky rhetoric and skill with metaphor, he was able animate the body of a slain African-American teenager, Trayvon Martin. \n \n Obama pronounced the killing as racially motivated, though he didn\'t use the words. He didn\'t have to, such is his prowess. It was so smooth that few noticed. He put the killing in a racial context, and that was enough. \n \n ""You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago,"" Obama told reporters at the White House on Friday, addressing last weekend\'s acquittal of Martin\'s shooter, George Zimmerman. \n \n Could Obama have been Trayvon Martin 35 years ago? \n \n Perhaps. If so, then any of us could have been Trayvon Martin. And I could have been Trayvon Martin. Racial motives weren\'t established at trial. And reportedly, the FBI still hasn\'t found racial motives in George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic. \n \n Race was established by the president of the United States, and by other political and media actors. It\'s a cynical business, about money and power, about keeping divisions between American tribes. There are the black tribes that see Martin in the context of the old civil rights struggles and leverage, and white tribes that see Martin being used to pummel them with racial guilt. \n \n The algebra of all of this is as old as some musty textbook in your uncle\'s garage. We\'ve seen it before. We\'ve heard the lines, the formulations, the slogans, and some of us recite them the way we recite phrases from television commercials. We\'re given just enough evidence and we\'re told we must choose a side. \n \n Yet none of this tribalism has anything to do with what happened the night Martin was killed. Politicians don\'t worry about that. They\'re experts at the game of tribes, and a tribal America is what nourishes them. \n \n Americanism should be about something more than tribes and groups. Americanism should instead be about individuals, about individual promise, individual accomplishment. \n \n Only an individual can give another respect. Tribes can\'t. What tribes do is battle other tribes over the spoils of government. This has nothing to do with individual respect. It has everything to do with group leverage. \n \n Clearly, Martin and Zimmerman didn\'t give each other respect. Each one could and should have walked away, and didn\'t. Many homicides happen that way, with bad choices and stupidity and anger. Homicides are never political at the beginning. They become so only after the body is cold, when the political actors approach and heat things up. \n \n The rest of the president\'s commentary was quite touching, describing how young African-American men are followed in department stores, and how he was one of those followed, or how motorists lock their doors, how women clutch their purses when a black man enters an elevator. \n \n It was compelling talk for a president who avoids discussing race almost as much as he avoids discussing all those young African-American men shot down in Chicago every year in the street gang wars. \n \n But first came the sound bite in which he became Trayvon Martin. He knew what he was delivering. It was no accident. The rest of it was the cover. Many will applaud him for initiating sensitive discussion about race in America, and many will miss completely what he did. \n \n He played the race card and they didn\'t see it coming. He attributed racial motive to a homicide even though the race angle was never established in court. And he\'ll be praised. That\'s skill. That\'s power. \n \n Despite Obama\'s assertion that he could have been Martin, the jury did not believe that the teenager was killed because he was black. \n \n Many in the news media clearly believed the race angle, which reinforces American tribalism. Perhaps the worst of many violators was NBC News. That network\'s cynical editing of Zimmerman\'s 911 emergency call should cost them millions in damages. \n \n By saying he could have been Trayvon Martin, President Obama bypassed the evidence and established his own motive. Only a maestro could accomplish this. \n \n ""I think it\'s going to be important for all of us to do some soul searching,"" Obama said, and I hope he included himself in the search. \n \n ""There has been talk about should we convene a conversation on race,"" he continued. ""I haven\'t seen that to be particularly productive. When politicians try to organize conversations they end up being stilted and politicized, when folks are locked into the positions they already have."" \n \n They get locked into positions with help from those who would ostensibly lead them away from ignorance and anger and fear. No one wins the game of tribes but the leaders. \n \n * * * \n \n The Sunday Tribune is full of interesting and compelling stories, but one I certainly hope you read was written by William Lee. You know him as ""Old School,"" the reporter who helps me with the column. Will Lee has written the story of Sylvester Washington, aka Two-Gun Pete, the Chicago cop with the pearl-handled revolvers who left many men dead and is a legend on the South Side. If you want to know about the real heart of Chicago, then read about Two-Gun: CLICK HERE. \n \n jskass@tribune.com \n \n Twitter @John_Kass', 'This story is updated at the bottom with a response from Rich Benjamin \n \n When people hold their breath for your imminent words, isn’t it exasperating when you open your mouth, but don’t say much? \n \n Finally the president has spoken about George Zimmerman’s acquittal. Even as the country waited for his singular response – the nation’s leader and a law professor who once looked like Trayvon Martin – the president danced around the issues. And what a dramatic anti-climax, listening to the president refuse to say anything insightful or profound about the acquittal. In signature professorial style, the president gave us the “context” to the episode and to black people’s “pain.” But he didn’t offer a meaningful opinion on the episode’s hot molten core: racial profiling, vigilantism, and “Stand Your Ground” laws. \n \n Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder delivered trenchant thoughts on the acquittal, demanding action. Before an audience of supporters, Holder recently called for a full investigation of Martin\'s death after Zimmerman\'s acquittal. Holder vowed that the Justice Department will act “in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We will not be afraid."" \n \n “We must stand our ground,” he told supporters. \n \n Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Nigger. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Nigger? \n \n Is Holder the president’s aggressive internal mind and voice -- willing to speak truth to power, but unbothered with appearing like an angry black man? \n \n In 2007, when candidate Obama gave that infamous speech in Philadelphia, distancing himself from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the nation and media responded with enthralled appreciation. It was, indeed, a heartwarming speech. When Holder gave his NAACP speech this past Tuesday, much of corporate-owned cable media —FOX, CNN, and MSNBC—aborted any speech coverage, in favor of their own cranky commentary. \n \n Apparently, Holder wasn’t giving America the race speech it wants to hear. \n \n From guns to gays, here is a man always ready to speak truth to power. (Well, except to the NSA). Little wonder the right has been actively trying to drive him from office, even more so than it does Obama. \n \n From a tactical standpoint, it’s wise for the president to avoid discussing race and Trayvon Martin. Many white Americans don’t want that discussion. Many whites avoid that discussion due to their sincere ethical desire to wash the stain of racial differentiation from our nation; they see themselves as Reverend King’s color- blind disciples. Still others avoid the topic because they suffer from racial fatigue. They feel harassed and hectored by so-called race hustlers. Enough with that: They want to focus on the technical and legal aspects of Zimmerman’s acquittal. \n \n Where Trayvon Martin is concerned, the president is also wise to sweep a racial discussion under the rug, because that discussion tarnishes his political capital. Politically, he seeks to run-up his party’s Latino support, by burnishing his reputation for historic inclusion and racial reconciliation. In discouraging too much diversity talk or racial gripe, the president’s image management promotes him as a racial icon with no racial agenda. His image management shrewdly polishes his racial identity even as it downplays it. \n \n Then there’s Obama’s Dark Doppelganger. Don’t you remember? Holder’s first speech in office as Attorney General set headlines afire because he branded America “a nation of cowards” for skirting frank conversations about race. Holder’s remarks piqued white Americans who lauded their own forward thinking in voting for Obama, only to be called “coward” by Obama’s chief lawyer. (So much for racial catharsis!) \n \n In that 2009 speech, Holder scolded America for “retreating to our race protected cocoons, where much is comfortable and where progress is not really made.” He darkly warned that if Americans continue to avoid meaningful racial debate, “the coming diversity that could be such a powerful, positive force will, instead, become a reason for stagnation and polarization.” His 2009 insight seems painfully prescient to Zimmerman’s acquittal and our present confusion. \n \n The Secret Service calls the president “Renegade,” his agency nickname. It seems, these days, that Holder is the real renegade. The country\'s Rogue Negro. And the president’s repressed Black Id. \n \n Who can blame Obama for not intelligently confronting race in this horrific dilemma? But we shouldn’t blame his top cop for doing so, either. \n \n UPDATE, Saturday morning \n \n Since Salon and I have received a lot of feedback, some of it very upset, about this article, I’d like to take the time to respond. \n \n First I want to express my extreme admiration for the president and for the attorney general, which I have stated publicly and to them personally. My autographed copy of ""Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance"" is one of my most cherished possessions. \n \n Major thinkers, from Carl Jung to W.E.B. DuBois to Franz Fanon, have written about the internalized split or hybridized consciousness that conflicts humans. As such, what black person doesn’t understand duality and double consciousness, especially when s/he speaks to multiple publics and circulates in multiple contexts? This question of internal and externalized conflicts, to my thinking, becomes particularly poignant and urgent in this instance: Two of our country’s most powerful black leaders are speaking to multiple audiences in reaction to a horrific race-related event. \n \n To speak of a person’s “inner child” is not to call that person a child. To speak of a person’s “inner diva” is not to call that person a diva. To speak of a person’s “inner nigger” is not to call that person a nigger. It is merely to wonder what aspect of that person’s outlook that person strategically covers. In his brilliant work ""Covering: The Hidden Assault on our Civil Rights,"" New York University Law Professor Kenji Yoshino asks to what extent leaders “downplay a disfavored trait so as to blend into the mainstream, [because] all of us possess stigmatized attributes, we all encounter pressure to cover in our daily lives.” As Yoshina brilliantly illustrates, mostly in the context of LGBT rights, “covering” one’s reportedly negative “minority traits” has an insidious and detrimental effect on the long-term prospects of civil rights. My Salon article asks to what extent the president covers his race-based thoughts, and whether Mr. Holder is a surrogate, or an active proponent, of the president’s potentially more controversial, but productive, viewpoints. Does Mr. Holder provide the president “cover” for the president to express his opinions on this volatile topic, but in softer terms? Eric Holder has been much more vocal and active on issues of race during this administration; I do not “blame” anyone for this, but I do point it out. \n \n Some Salon readers were upset by my use of the word “nigger.” I am not the first to use this term in public discussion, nor will I be the last. The term is in wide circulation in the streets, in private homes, in popular culture, in black-generated rap music, and in thoughtful scholarship, most notably in Harvard Law Professor Randall Kennedy’s exceptional tome, ""Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word."" My use of the word isn’t haphazard or gratuitous. Language is central to race. Language has been central to Martin’s tragic death and to Zimmerman’s acquittal. Language is central to our implicit and explicit racial biases. As a writer, evaluating speeches, by two capable and eloquent public servants, I use the word “nigger” with deep understanding of its long, complicated existence. \n \n As someone who has traveled the country extensively talking to people about their racial viewpoints, and in turn has conversed with people about race and those findings, I’m sensitive to the complexity that such discussions bring. As someone who has been called “nigger” affectionately and violently, I do understand firsthand readers\' concerns with that term. \n \n At any rate, this is an important debate, and I am grateful for the feedback, the better to contribute to the discussion.', 'President Obama did something Friday that he hardly ever does — and no other president could ever have done. He addressed the racial fault lines in the country by laying bare his personal anguish and experience in an effort to help white Americans understand why African-Americans reacted with frustration and anger to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. \n \n Mr. Obama’s comments during a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing crystallized the dissonance around this case. In the narrow confines of the trial, all talk of race was excluded, and the “stand your ground” element in Florida’s self-defense law was not invoked by Mr. Zimmerman’s lawyers. But in the broader, more profound and more troubling context of Mr. Martin’s death, race and Florida’s lax gun laws are inextricably interwoven. \n \n On the first, Mr. Obama said: “The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments.” The jurors, he added, “were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict.” \n \n But on the broader context, Mr. Obama eloquently rebutted those — like Representative Andy Harris, a Republican, with his dismissive “get over it” remark on Tuesday — who said that the verdict should have ended discussion of the case, especially talk about race and gun laws. \n \n “Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” Mr. Obama said, adding that “it’s important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn’t go away.” \n \n He said there are “very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store” or “the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.” \n \n “That,” he said, “includes me.” \n \n Mr. Obama said African-Americans are also acutely aware that “there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws — everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws.” \n \n He said it would be naïve not to recognize that young African-American men are “disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.” But using those statistics “to then see sons treated differently causes pain,” he said. \n \n Mr. Obama called on the Justice Department to work with local and state law enforcement to reduce mistrust in the policing system, including ending racial profiling. He also called for an examination of state and local laws to see whether they “are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case.” \n \n Mr. Obama raised questions about the message that “stand your ground” laws send, telling a citizen that he “potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there’s a way for them to exit from a situation.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Obama noted that Mr. Zimmerman did not invoke that defense. But he said it was still relevant. In one of the most powerful parts of his remarks, he said: “I’d just ask people to consider, if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?” \n \n If the answer is “at least ambiguous,” Mr. Obama said, “we might want to examine those kinds of laws.” \n \n Mr. Obama said Americans needed to give African-American boys “the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them.” \n \n He said he was not talking about “some grand, new federal program” or even a national “conversation on race,” which he said often ends up being “stilted and politicized” and reaffirms pre-existing positions. \n \n In a way, Mr. Obama began that conversation with these remarks, while speaking directly to African-Americans who have longed to hear him identify with their frustrations and their anger. \n \n It is a great thing for this country to have a president who could do what Mr. Obama did on Friday. It is sad that we still need him to do it.', ""Full transcript of President Obama's remarks on race and the Trayvon Martin case, Friday, July 19, 2013, in the White House press briefing room, as released by the White House: \n \n \n \n THE PRESIDENT: I wanted to come out here, first of all, to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session. The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks, there's going to obviously be a whole range of issues -- immigration, economics, et cetera -- we'll try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions. \n \n The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions, but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week -- the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling. I gave a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday. But watching the debate over the course of the last week, I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit. \n \n First of all, I want to make sure that, once again, I send my thoughts and prayers, as well as Michelle's, to the family of Trayvon Martin, and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they've dealt with the entire situation. I can only imagine what they're going through, and it's remarkable how they've handled it. \n \n The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday, which is there's going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case -- I'll let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues. The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments. The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict. And once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works. But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling. \n \n You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away. \n \n There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me -- at least before I was a senator. There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often. \n \n no previous page \n \n next""]",4,"– President Obama's surprise comments yesterday on the George Zimmerman verdict—""Trayvon Martin could have been me""—continue to resonate today. Examples: New York Times editorial: It lavishes high praise on Obama for ""laying bare his personal anguish and experience"" to explain why black Americans were so frustrated by the acquittal. His important, eloquent words went beyond the specifics of the trial and ""crystallized the dissonance around this case."" It's great we have a president who can do that, but it's ""sad that we still need him to do it."" Jonathan Chait, New York: It was ""instantly historic,"" he writes. ""Obama understands that interjecting himself into a racialized controversy carries risks, but he also believes that the electorate of the future is on his side. His remarks are probably aimed not at the present but at posterity."" John Kass, Chicago Tribune: All the people praising the speech are missing something, Kass argues. Obama ""played the race card and they didn't see it coming. He attributed racial motive to a homicide even though the race angle was never established in court.""

Rich Benjamin, Salon: He calls the speech a ""dramatic anti-climax,"" arguing that Obama didn't say anything ""insightful or profound."" But Benjamin, who is black, raised a ruckus when he compared Obama's response unfavorably to Eric Holder's ""trenchant"" remarks. ""Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Nigger.

"['""I do not know your name — but I know that a lot of people failed you that terrible January night and in the months that followed,"" Biden wrote. ""It must have been wrenching — to relive what he did to you all over again. But you did it anyway, in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking."" \n \n Biden, who wrote the 1994 Violence Against Women Act and is involved in the White House\'s ""It\'s On Us"" campaign against campus sexual assault, sent the letter to BuzzFeed News on Thursday. In it, he said he is ""filled with furious anger — both that this happened to you and that our culture is still so broken that you were ever put in the position of defending your own worth."" He said the woman\'s actions ""will save lives."" \n \n Her letter has since been read by millions of people and has drawn attention to the judge\'s six-month sentence for Brock Turner — the champion swimmer who was convicted of three counts of sexual assault — even though he faced up to 14 years in prison. \n \n Vice President Joe Biden penned an open letter to the Stanford sexual assault survivor who read a powerful message to her assailant in court detailing the effects of his actions on her. \n \n An Open Letter to a Courageous Young Woman \n \n I do not know your name — but your words are forever seared on my soul. Words that should be required reading for men and women of all ages. \n \n Words that I wish with all of my heart you never had to write. \n \n I am in awe of your courage for speaking out — for so clearly naming the wrongs that were done to you and so passionately asserting your equal claim to human dignity. \n \n And I am filled with furious anger — both that this happened to you and that our culture is still so broken that you were ever put in the position of defending your own worth. \n \n It must have been wrenching — to relive what he did to you all over again. But you did it anyway, in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking. \n \n You are a warrior — with a solid steel spine. \n \n I do not know your name — but I know that a lot of people failed you that terrible January night and in the months that followed. \n \n Anyone at that party who saw that you were incapacitated yet looked the other way and did not offer assistance. Anyone who dismissed what happened to you as ""just another crazy night."" Anyone who asked “what did you expect would happen when you drank that much?” or thought you must have brought it on yourself. \n \n You were failed by a culture on our college campuses where one in five women is sexually assaulted — year after year after year. A culture that promotes passivity. That encourages young men and women on campuses to simply turn a blind eye. \n \n The statistics on college sexual assault haven’t gone down in the past two decades. It’s obscene, and it’s a failure that lies at all our feet. \n \n And you were failed by anyone who dared to question this one clear and simple truth: Sex without consent is rape. Period. It is a crime. \n \n I do not know your name — but thanks to you, I know that heroes ride bicycles. \n \n Those two men who saw what was happening to you — who took it upon themselves to step in — they did what they instinctually knew to be right. \n \n They did not say ""It\'s none of my business."" \n \n They did not worry about the social or safety implications of intervening, or about what their peers might think. \n \n Those two men epitomize what it means to be a responsible bystander. \n \n To do otherwise — to see an assault about to take place and do nothing to intervene — makes you part of the problem. \n \n Like I tell college students all over this country — it’s on us. All of us. \n \n We all have a responsibility to stop the scourge of violence against women once and for all. \n \n I do not know your name — but I see your unconquerable spirit. \n \n I see the limitless potential of an incredibly talented young woman — full of possibility. I see the shoulders on which our dreams for the future rest. \n \n I see you. \n \n You will never be defined by what the defendant’s father callously termed “20 minutes of action.” \n \n His son will be. \n \n I join your global chorus of supporters, because we can never say enough to survivors: I believe you. It is not your fault. \n \n What you endured is never, never, never, NEVER a woman\'s fault. \n \n And while the justice system has spoken in your particular case, the nation is not satisfied. \n \n And that is why we will continue to speak out. \n \n We will speak to change the culture on our college campuses — a culture that continues to ask the wrong questions: What were you wearing? \n \n Why were you there? What did you say? How much did you drink? \n \n Instead of asking: Why did he think he had license to rape? \n \n We will speak out against those who seek to engage in plausible deniability. Those who know that this is happening, but don\'t want to get involved.

Ted Poe called today for the removal of a California judge who sentenced a former Stanford athlete convicted of sexual assault to six months in prison. \n \n Poe, a former prosecutor and criminal court judge, took to the House floor and blasted Judge Aaron Persky’s sentence as “pathetic,” saying: “The punishment for rape should be longer than a semester of college.” \n \n Poe, R-Humble, said that Brock Turner — a 20-year-old champion swimmer convicted of assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster in 2015 — should face tougher penalties. \n \n Brock was convicted last week of three counts of sexual assault and, in addition to six months in prison and three years’ probation, will have to register as a sex offender. \n \n Turner was not convicted of rape because, under California law, rape is defined as someone using “physical force, intimidation, duress, or threats to persuade the victim to engage in intercourse.” \n \n Witnesses and testimony determined that Turner penetrated his victim with a foreign object, not a sexual organ. \n \n The case has ignited a fierce debate about victims’ rights and how the court system treats upper-middle-class white men. \n \n “This judge got it wrong. There is an archaic philosophy in some courts that sin ain’t sin as long as good folk do it,” said Poe. “The judge should be removed. The rapist should do more time for the dastardly deed he did that night.” \n \n Poe has no authority to remove Persky from the bench but urged an appeals court to overturn Turner’s sentence and for California voters to petition for his ouster. \n \n Turner will be serving an even shorter sentence than what Persky gave him, Mic reports. The Santa Clara County’s Department of Corrections website lists Turner’s release as Sept. 2 — three months after his booking date, June 2. \n \n In addition to being outraged by the judge’s sentence, many have expressed frustration over comments from Turner’s father, who called prison “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action.” \n \n “The judge said: ‘A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.’ Isn’t that the point?” Poe said. \n \n At Turner’s sentencing, his unnamed victim read him a letter. \n \n Poe on Thursday read portions of the victim’s 7,000-plus word letter, which explained in graphic detail the impact of the assault on her life. The assault was reportedly halted by two students passing by on bicycles while the woman was still unconscious. \n \n A rape victim’s message to a former Stanford swimmer | @DMNOpinion https://t.co/ElLVkVhB84 pic.twitter.com/5kkovNakiu — Dallas Morning News (@dallasnews) June 8, 2016 \n \n In an interview with The Dallas Morning News, Poe called the woman’s missive “the Bible on what happens to sexual assault victims.” \n \n “For many victims, rape is a fate worse than death,” Poe said. “Because rape victims say after being raped, they die emotionally many times. And with homicide, one dies only once.” \n \n Vice President Joe Biden issued his own open letter to the victim Thursday afternoon which began: \n \n “I do not know your name — but your words are forever seared on my soul. Words that should be required reading for men and women of all ages.

Another photo showed the victim making a sexually provocative gesture. \n \n The judge allowed the images to be shown to the jury in the civil case after the defense argued that they would help prove that the young woman was not, as she claimed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. \n \n “Did you have PTSD when you did the acts shown in these pictures?” one defense attorney asked the woman in court, according to the San Jose Mercury News. \n \n Barbara Spector, one of the attorneys for the alleged victim, who was known as Jane Doe, said that she felt at the time the images “were irrelevant”. \n \n \n \n “The impact was very definitely prejudicial for Jane Doe and had a positive impact for the defendants on the jury,” she said. \n \n \n \n Four of the defendants settled, three had charges dismissed and two went through the trial and were found not liable by the jury. \n \n Persky is now facing international scrutiny, after the victim in the Stanford case released a viral statement on the trauma of her assault, prompting messages of support from vice-president Joe Biden and actor Lena Dunham. \n \n Critics have also launched a recall campaign against Persky over his decision to sentence Turner to six months in county jail – a punishment that is much more lenient than the two years in prison prescribed by law. \n \n Persky, who has reportedly faced death threats in the wake of the backlash has, however, received support from an unlikely source: the public defenders who represent indigent defendants in his Santa Clara county. \n \n Several have told the Guardian the judge has a reputation for being fair to their clients and his apparent leniency in the Stanford swimmer case was in-keeping with his general approach to criminal cases. \n \n However his role in the De Anza civil trial is likely to raise further questions about his handling of sexual assault cases. \n \n On the night of 4 March 2007, three members of the De Anza women’s soccer team barged into the bedroom of an off-campus house during a birthday party. They claimed that they found a 17-year-old girl unconscious and being sexually assaulted by a group of men. \n \n The witnesses testified that they tried to get inside the room, but men initially prevented them from entering. Inside, they said they saw a man thrusting on top of the woman. \n \n The female soccer players were later hailed as heroes by the San Jose city council. \n \n Stanford sexual assault case: victim impact statement in full Read more \n \n Eight members of the baseball team were quickly suspended by the community college’s athletics department, but no arrests were made, even after a second woman came forward to say that she too had been sexually assaulted by De Anza college baseball players. \n \n Two and a half months later, the Santa Clara County district attorney announced that she would not file criminal charges in the case, despite the fact that the sheriff, whose department investigated the case, stated publicly that she believed “a crime occurred”. \n \n “The bottom line is it’s not about what we believe happened or think happened. It’s about what we can prove happened,” the district attorney, Dolores Carr, told the San Francisco Chronicle at the time, in the face of intense criticism of her decision not to prosecute. \n \n The outcry against Carr in 2007 has been echoed by the torrent of anger directed at Persky since his sentencing of Turner. \n \n “It sent a message to victims that they can’t find justice in Santa Clara County,” Irene Weiser, an advocate for victims of assault, told the Chronicle at the time of the De Anza case. “It also sent a message to perpetrators and would-be perpetrators. It gave them a green light.” \n \n One year after the alleged 2007 assault took place, the young woman sought another avenue to have her day in court: a civil lawsuit seeking damages from her alleged attackers. \n \n Looking at the most recent case, it seems that [Persky’s] ruling was rooted in something different Monica Burneikis, attorney \n \n The case finally went in front of Persky and a jury in March 2011, following three years of legal wrangling overseen by a different judge. As a civil case, the plaintiff and her attorneys were tasked not with proving guilt, but with proving liability and culpability. \n \n The photographs of Jane Doe at a party less than a year after the alleged assault were allowed by Judge Persky after defense attorneys argued that they contradicted the plaintiff’s claims about how the alleged gang rape had harmed her emotionally and psychologically. \n \n At the time of the De Anza case, the plaintiff’s other lawyer, Monica Burneikis, speculated that at least one of Persky’s controversial rulings may have been because he was inexperienced in civil cases, but the Stanford case has changed her mind. \n \n “Looking at the most recent case, it seems that [Persky’s] ruling was rooted in something different,” Burneikis said. \n \n ‘Nail in a coffin’ \n \n Jane Doe’s lawyers said the photographs were not the only evidence that Persky unfairly permitted. \n \n Another controversy related to Persky’s handling of the case stemmed from his decision over testimony from the alleged attackers. \n \n Four of the baseball players invoked fifth amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation. \n \n According to Burneikis, that was a critical juncture: preventing the young woman’s team from obtaining evidence that could have helped them pursue their case. \n \n The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could stay silent, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from testifying in a later part of the case. \n \n \n \n That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky, a move that Jane Doe’s attorneys now say undermined her case. \n \n Persky, taking over the trail in 2011, allowed one of the defendants, Christopher Knopf, to enter evidence that the woman’s lawyers believed should have been covered by the earlier judge’s order. \n \n “It was shocking to see judge Persky disregard that order,” Burneikis said. “One judge completely disregarding an order that another judge has entered: yes, that was unusual.” \n \n “It was devastating,” she continued. “I can remember how I felt the moment the ruling came down and it was like a nail in a coffin. I could not comprehend it.” \n \n Persky did not respond to requests for comment. Alison Crane, attorney for the defendants, who asked the woman about the questionable photos, also did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Persky’s defenders \n \n Persky was only in the position to influence the outcome of the De Anza case because it was brought in civil, rather than criminal, court, after prosecutors did not bring charges. Such an outcome is indicative of a criminal justice system which, advocates for survivors of sexual assault say, fails to hold perpetrators accountable. Research has repeatedly shown that only a small fraction of rape cases lead to prosecution. \n \n The Stanford rape case: a white privilege cake with vanilla frosting on top Read more \n \n Persky’s critics have argued that his actions in the De Anza case and the Stanford assault reflect a lack of empathy for victims, noting that the judge himself was a former Stanford athlete. \n \n But defenders of the judge have come forward in recent days and argued that it’s critical for judges to have discretion and that he should be applauded for avoiding overly harsh sentences. \n \n “Persky has a reputation for being a thoughtful jurist and he has been fair and decent to our clients, many of whom come from poor socioeconomic backgrounds,” said Jennifer Redding, a public defender in Santa Clara. \n \n “Based on my experience and knowledge of judge Persky’s reputation I do not believe that he granted [Turner] probation because the defendant reportedly came from a privileged background,” said Andy Gutierrez, deputy public defender for Santa Clara county. \n \n Gutierrez noted that it can be especially challenging for judges to issue appropriate sentences when the crimes are violent or horrendous. But sometimes, he said, it’s the right thing to do. \n \n “In notorious cases, whether it involves a sexual assault, a child molestation, or even a gang crime, there is often public clamor for a heavy sentence. A judge must resist the temptation to be swallowed by such public sentiment. That is one of the toughest things for a judge to do.” \n \n This article was amended on 9 June 2016.

"['By Staff Sgt. Benjamin W. Stratton, 7th Air Force Public Affairs / Published March 24, 2017 \n \n OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea (AFNS) -- South Korea and U.S. military forces participated in an annual command and control exercise called Key Resolve (KR17) held across the Korean Peninsula March 8 to 23, 2017. \n \n \n \n From its start, the exercise highlights the longstanding and enduring partnership and friendship between the two nations and their combined commitment to the defense of South Korea and regional stability. \n \n \n \n Approximately 12,800 U.S. forces along with 10,000 South Korean military personnel joined dozens of augmentation forces and multinational representatives from the United Nations Command including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France and Great Britain. \n \n \n \n Lt. Gen. Thomas Bergeson, the Air Component Command, South Korea/U.S. Combined Forces Command and 7th Air Force commander, explained the significance of exercises like Key Resolve and the combined U.S. and U.N. commitment to South Korea. \n \n \n \n “Our mission is first and foremost to deter any aggression from North Korea,” he said. “If that deterrence fails then we are in a position to defend the Republic of Korea. And if we defend, we are going to defeat the enemy and win.” \n \n \n \n The general went on to explain how vitally important this region of the world is to all nations. \n \n \n \n “Over 20 percent of the world’s economic output comes from Northeast Asia,” he continued. “This is a very vital portion of the world and so it’s extremely important not just to the United States but to the rest of the world as well.” \n \n \n \n KR17 is conducted in accordance with the South Korean-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty, signed Oct. 1, 1953. The exercise strengthens the two nation’s regional security cooperation essential for addressing the growing threat from North Korea. A strong defense relationship among the U.S., CFC and South Korea serves as the anchor of stability in the region. \n \n \n \n “Allies are critical to the United States,” Bergeson said. “Our friends and our allies, we share common values: democracy, respect for human rights and laws, and so we want to work together to try to retain peace and security throughout this region.” \n \n \n \n The defense treaty further emboldens Koreans and Americans alike in their collective desire “to strengthen the fabric of peace in the Pacific area.” \n \n \n \n Exercises like KR17 afford both U.S. and South Korean service members an opportunity to work side-by-side in the same way they would operate if actually going to war. Senior Airman Ivan Cooper, with the 15th Operations Support Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, explains how this experience not only makes him a better Airman, but a more effective weather forecaster. \n \n \n \n “Key Resolve has really opened my eyes to new ways of handling difficult situations,” he said. “It helps improve our communication skills not only internally with other Americans, but especially with the Koreans as well.” \n \n \n \n Cooper’s weather forecast counterpart in the South Korean air force, 1st Lt. Jaewon Yoo with the Osan Weather Squadron, echoed his partner’s sentiment saying the opportunity to work side-by-side with U.S. forecasters has been an extremely enriching experience. \n \n \n \n “This is very important because the way we forecast is different from the way the Americans forecast,” Yoo explained. “Key Resolve has brought us closer together and helped us understand how we can work as a unified team to deter the enemy and make a difference.” \n \n \n \n That feeling reaches up and down the ranks, from airman basic through the general officers, and only emboldens U.S. and South Korean forces in their deterrence mission as the common ground. \n \n \n \n “We’re not going to fight wars alone,” said Capt. Abi Oilar, an air battle manager with the 612th Air Operations Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. “Back at home station, I’m used to operating at the tactical level, whereas here, I’ve had to do more critical thinking and approach the scenarios from a different perspective. Working alongside the (South Korean air force) has opened my eyes to new ways of approaching the situations that I’ll be able to take back with me and share with others in my home command.” \n \n \n \n But it takes more than air power to win a war and according to Bergeson, the Korean Air Power Team is made up of the U.S. Air Force, the South Korean air force as well as the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade and U.S. Army and liaisons from the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy that all bring together their air components into what the general calls the Korean Air Power Team. \n \n \n \n “The Air Component is responsible for any of the operations in air, space and cyberspace,” the general said. “The other components are responsible for operations in their domains, whether on land or in the sea, or with the Marines who are doing amphibious operations. So we coordinate with them every day by having liaison officers who work in all different command centers.” \n \n \n \n One such liaison officer, U.S. Army Maj. Tony Wrice, with the 3rd Battlefield Coordination Detachment at Osan AB, said it’s “amazing what we can do when we come together as one unified team.” \n \n \n \n “This exercise has been a really great experience working together with our Air Force, the (South Korean air force) and (South Korean) army, and all the UNCs,” Wrice said. “I’m responsible for ensuring our artillery and other ground forces don’t conflict with the needs and operations of the air component. Every day I’m working with (South Korean air force) and (South Korean) army counterparts to make sure we can communicate each component’s needs, de-conflict any issues and meet objectives.” \n \n \n \n Although Army personnel are greatly outnumbered in this exercise, their necessity to mission success remains as evident today as during the Korean War nearly 70 years ago. \n \n \n \n “To be able to bring all our resources together and really focus on winning the fight is incredible,” Wrice continued. “Key Resolve makes it all happen.” \n \n \n \n The exercise is about more than sharpening South Korea’s defense, it’s about assembling a team by building on old friendships with a renewed focus on freedom and prosperity across the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. \n \n \n \n “The team has done extraordinarily well,” the general said. “This is a difficult exercise, we want it to be difficult, and so we are learning lessons as we go along. Some things we’re not doing perfectly but that’s why you do it; that’s why you practice. You practice to make it very difficult so that if you were ever to have to do this for real, you’re prepared for it.” \n \n \n \n Similarly, South Korean air force Lt. Gen. Won In Choul, the Air Component Command deputy commander, said he couldn’t be prouder of the brave men and women who daily put their lives on the line in defense of South Korea. \n \n \n \n “Forged in the blood spilled by the Korean War, six decades of ROK-U.S. alliance has developed and fortified each nation’s military, economy and diplomacy,” he said. “(Our combined) planning and preparation allowed this to be the most realistic exercise in history. I’m grateful for the dedication and passion of not only ROK and U.S. Airmen but also Soldiers, Sailors and Marines.” \n \n \n \n “I wish safe travels for the augmentees who participated in the exercise from outside the Korean theater of operations,” Choul added. “Thank you.”', 'U.S. Fast-Tracks Missile Defense System To South Korea, Drawing China\'s Ire \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Force Korea via AP U.S. Force Korea via AP \n \n North Korea again tested ballistic missiles this week, firing four of them into the waters near Japan.

Here\'s what you need to know: \n \n What\'s THAAD? \n \n It\'s an American missile defense system designed to shoot down short and intermediate range missiles in the terminal phase — often described as like shooting a bullet with a bullet. There\'s currently a system installed on Guam. As North Korea tested ballistic missiles last year, the United States argued that THAAD was increasingly necessary in South Korea. \n \n Seoul\'s current conservative administration approved it after months of consternation and public hand wringing. It was supposed to be deployed before the end of this year in southern South Korea, on land that is currently a golf course. \n \n \n \n But the Chinese are expressing unhappiness. What does it have to do with the Chinese? \n \n \n \n The Chinese seem more worried about THAAD\'s radar system than its missiles. This system has the capability, the Chinese say, to track where China\'s missile systems are located, giving the U.S. a strategic advantage. China is also questioning if THAAD would be effective against North Korea\'s short-range missiles, raising the question whether THAAD\'s primary goal is to contain China. The U.S. has maintained the system is merely defensive. \n \n \n \n What is China doing about it? \n \n China\'s first target has been to hit South Korea economically, putting restrictions on business and shutting down stores owned by the Lotte conglomerate, which agreed to allow THAAD to be built on its golf course. Chinese travel agencies are stopping ticket sales and tour packages to South Korea, and there are calls to boycott South Korean products like K-dramas and K-pop concerts. \n \n Some of this may sound trivial, but China is South Korea\'s largest trading partner, so this could have a damaging economic impact. Then, earlier this week after THAAD batteries arrived near Seoul, China\'s foreign ministry said China would take ""necessary measures"" against it. It\'s unclear what this means, but according to some military experts, China may be developing technology to blind THAAD\'s control system, essentially jamming it. \n \n \n \n What has the reaction been in South Korea to these measures? \n \n China\'s retaliation, as South Korea sees it, brought widespread condemnation in the media, and created anxiety among policymakers. Some even called for the country to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. Others are calling for more restraint. But it\'s important to remember that there\'s been little evidence of a slowdown in trade of manufactured goods between the two countries, which makes up a huge chunk of bilateral commerce. \n \n \n \n And South Korea is in a leadership vacuum. The president\'s already been impeached and could be removed as early as tomorrow. Could this have an impact on the deployment of THAAD? \n \n \n \n It might play into why the U.S. abruptly announced this week that it started setting up the THAAD system several months sooner than expected. There\'s a case to be made that the deployment is being fast-tracked ahead of a new South Korean administration, which could be less accepting of the system. The left-leaning Democratic Party (which is currently out of power) has more members opposed to or skeptical about THAAD deployment. It\'s also possible the effort is going faster than expected because the defense ministry recently reached a land deal for the system\'s location — and because North Korea has stepped up its missile tests in recent weeks.', 'OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea — With the stakes on the Korean peninsula as high as they have ever been, life for the men and women here with the U.S. Air Force\'s 51st Fighter Wing is lived in a state of constant alert. \n \n South Korea has no nuclear weapons, so it relies on the United States\' nuclear umbrella to deter North Korea and its erratic leader, Kim Jong Un. \n \n That makes Osan — less than 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone separating the mortal enemies and home to a large proportion of the 28,500 U.S. military personnel in South Korea — the leading edge of the shield that protects the South from the North. \n \n Hence the base\'s slogan: ""Ready to Fight Tonight."" \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed U.S. Military in North Korea: \'Ready to Fight Tonight\' 3:08 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n NBC Nightly News Exclusive: Lester Holt anchors from South Korea on Monday and Tuesday, April 3 and 4, at 6:30pm ET. \n \n Patriot missile batteries are poised to defend the base from North Korean ballistic missiles.

It took place just as the US sent part of a controversial missile defense system called THAAD to Osan, reports NPR. (Japan weighs in on this week's ""extremely problematic"" test.)"
"['Remember the California couple who found $10 million in gold coins on their property? They’re probably going to end up with NOTHING in the final analysis, as breaking news from San Francisco reveals that the source of the mystery gold has been discovered: \n \n A story that describes a gold heist from the San Francisco Mint at the turn of the century could explain the source of the gold coins worth $10 million that were found last month in California’s Mother Lode country. The published news item was discovered in the Haithi Trust Digital Library and was provided by Northern California fishing guide Jack Trout, who doubles as a historian and collector of rare coins. \n \n The details of the 1899 heist — $30,000 face value of uncirculated gold coins stolen from the San Francisco Mint in 1899 — matches every known fact about the gold coins found recently in the Sierra foothills, which were nearly $30,000 in face value of uncirculated mint condition coins mostly made at the San Francisco Mint in the late 1800s. \n \n If, as is almost certainly the case, this explains the origin of the found coins, then the couple who found them will not merely have to pay taxes on them — they’ll have to turn them over entirely back to the federal government, since the coins’ status has changed from “treasure trove” to “stolen goods”: \n \n Treasure trove is any gold or silver in coin, plate, or bullion that is hidden by an unknown owner in the earth or other private place for an extended period. The property is not considered treasure trove unless the identity of the owner cannot be determined. Under early common law, the finder of a treasure trove took title to it against everyone but the true owner. The U.S. law governing treasure trove has been merged, for the most part, into the law governing lost property. In the absence of a contrary statutory provision, the title to treasure trove belongs to the finder against all others with the exception of the true owner. \n \n It was a nice story while it lasted. \n \n UPDATE \n \n Just to clarify: \n \n The finders will EITHER have to hand over all the coins back to the government, OR pay taxes on them (on the off-chance they win the legal battle to retain ownership of the coins). Under no circumstance (of which I am aware) would they have to pay taxes AND return the coins. \n \n UPDATE II \n \n A few of the coins in the hoard were from different U.S. Mints and from earlier in the 19th century. It could be the case that the Federal Government might only be able to prove that the coins amongst the hoard which can be confirmed as coming from the San Francisco Mint in 1899 must be returned, while the finders could contest that the remaining coins were not part of that robbery and thus not necessarily stolen property. It’s entirely possible that the person who originally buried the hoard mixed in coins from more than one different sources (or crimes). In this case, the finders and the government would split ownership. \n \n UPDATE III \n \n According to the 1906 edition of the official Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, a mint clerk named W.N. Dimmick was caught and convicted of stealing $30,000 in gold coins from the San Francisco Mint — although in the description of the case no mention is made of whether Dimmick ever revealed the location of the stolen coins, or whether they were ever recovered. \n \n Here is the full text of the relevant minutes from the House Hearings: \n \n \n \n \n \n Note that there is a discrepancy in the date of the supposed crime: Was it 1899, or 1901? A few pages later in the same minutes is this passage revealing that there may have been many other thefts from the mint as well, due to a plague of dishonest mint employees: \n \n Also note that one of the coins found in the hoard was an ultra-rare 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece missing the phrase “In God We Trust” — a coin which was never released to the public and which must have been produced and kept within the mint itself. \n \n This link to an article in the July 9, 1901 edition of the San Francisco Chronicle has more details about the Dimmick theft.', 'A California couple who found a stash of buried gold coins valued at $10 million may not be so lucky after all. The coins may have been stolen from the U.S. Mint in 1900 and thus be the property of the government, according to a published report. \n \n The San Francisco Chronicle\'s website reported that a search of the Haithi Trust Digital Library provided by Northern California fishing guide Jack Trout, who is also a historian and collector of rare coins, turned up the news of the theft. \n \n WATCH: $10M Gold Coins May Be Linked to Heist \n \n Play \n \n The California couple, who have not been identified, spotted the edge of an old can on a path they had hiked many times before several months ago. Poking at the can was the first step in uncovering a buried treasure of rare coins estimated to be worth $10 million. \n \n ""It was like finding a hot potato,"" the couple told coin expert Don Kagin from Kagin\'s, Inc. The couple hired the president of Kagin\'s, Inc. and Holabird-Kagin Americana, a western Americana dealer and auctioneer, to represent them. \n \n The coins are mostly uncirculated and in mint condition, and they add up in face value to $27,000. ""Those two facts are a match of the gold heist in 1900 from the San Francisco Mint,"" the newspaper reported. \n \n Jack Trout told the paper that an 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece without the words ""In God We Trust"" was part of the buried stash, and the coin may fetch over $1 million at auction because it\'s so rare. \n \n ""This was someone\'s private coin, created by the mint manager or someone with access to the inner workings of the Old Granite Lady (San Francisco Mint),"" Trout told the newspaper. ""It was likely created in revenge for the assassination of Lincoln the previous year (April 14, 1865). I don\'t believe that coin ever left The Mint until the robbery. For it to show up as part of the treasure find links it directly to that inside job at the turn of the century at the San Francisco Mint."" \n \n Mint spokesman Adam Stump issued this statement when contacted today by ABC News: ""We do not have any information linking the Saddle Ridge Hoard coins to any thefts at any United States Mint facility. Surviving agency records from the San Francisco Mint have been retired to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), under Record Group 104. Access to the records is under NARA\'s jurisdiction: http://www.archives.gov/."" \n \n Last week, when news of the stash first broke, coin dealer Kagin spoke about the rarity of such a find. \n \n ""Since 1981, people have been coming to us with one or two coins they find worth a few thousand dollars, but this is the first time we get someone with a whole cache of buried coins... It is a million to one chance, even harder than winning the lottery,"" Kagin told ABCNews.com. \n \n The couple is trying to remain anonymous after finding the five cans of coins last spring on their Tiburon property in northern California and conducted an interview with Kagin. \n \n WATCH: $10M Gold-Coin Surprise Uncovered in Calif. \n \n ""I never would have thought we would have found something like this. However, in a weird way I feel like I have been preparing my whole life for it,"" the couple said. \n \n ""I saw an old can sticking out of the ground on a trail that we had walked almost every day for many, many years. I was looking down in the right spot and saw the side of the can. I bent over to scrape some moss off and noticed that it had both ends on it,"" they said. \n \n It was the first of five cans to be unearthed, each packed with gold coins. \n \n ""Nearly all of the 1,427 coins, dating from 1847 to 1894, are in uncirculated, mint condition,"" said Kagin told ABCNews.com. \n \n He said that the couple plan to sell most of the coins, but before they do, they are ""loaning some to the American Numismatic Association for its National Money Show, which opens Thursday in Atlanta."" \n \n ""Some of the rarest coins could fetch as much as $1 million apiece,"" said Kagin. He also said that they wish to sell 90 percent of the collection through Amazon.com and on the company\'s website. \n \n ""We\'d like to help other people with some of this money. There are people in our community who are hungry and don\'t have enough to eat. We\'ll also donate to the arts and other overlooked causes. In a way it has been good to have time between finding the coins and being able to sell them in order to prepare and adjust. It\'s given us an opportunity to think about how to give back,"" said the couple. \n \n Kagin and his colleague David McCarthy, senior numismatist and researcher at Kagin\'s, met with the couple last April, two months after the hoard was found. \n \n When McCarthy and Kagin told the couple that their bonanza will be in the annals of numismatic stories for quite some time, the couple said, ""It would have been quite a pity not to share the magnitude of our find. We want to keep the story of these coins intact for posterity.""']",2,"– The only thing more mysterious than the identity of the couple who stumbled upon an estimated $10 million in US gold coins while walking their dog on their California property: Where did the gold come from? The San Francisco Chronicle floats a theory with all the intrigue and illegality you could hope for: Historian/coin collector/fishing guide Jack Trout provided the paper with a passage from the Bulletin of American Iron and Steel Association that references a $30,000 turn-of-the-century gold heist from the San Francisco Mint that he believes is linked to the coins. Lending credence to the theory: The unearthed 1,427 gold coins, dated 1847 to 1894, were mostly uncirculated and in chronological order, suggesting they hadn't entered the public realm. And though they are worth millions today, their face value is $27,000, which roughly syncs with what was taken from the mint. Trout also points to the buried stash's 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece not emblazoned with ""In God We Trust""; he suspects it was a private coin created by a mint manager that never left the mint. ""For it to show up as part of the treasure find links it directly"" to the mint heist, he says. But the couple's coin broker is no fan of the mint robbery theory, telling the Chronicle he'd expect the haul would have included coins dated closer to the heist date. But a former SF Mint detective sees it as plausible: ""Downstairs, we had vaults where we kept old coins that hadn't been put into circulation."" PJMedia further digs up a 1906 congressional report that indicates mint clerk W.N. Dimmick was convicted of the mint theft, but the document doesn't state whether Dimmick revealed the coins' location, or if they had been recovered. ABC News notes that if the coins are indeed purloined government property, the couple may owe Uncle Sam more than a heck of a lot in taxes: They may have to turn over the entire haul, and get a finder's fee in return."
"['The Community of Christ\x92s USA National Conference has recommended policy changes that would allow for the ordination of gay people and marriages or covenant commitment services of gay couples. \n \n The conference held last weekend attracted about 2,000 people, including about 1,500 delegates, to the Community of Christ Auditorium in Independence, said Kendra Friend, a member of the church\x92s communications and media relations team. \n \n The delegates, by more than the required majority, recommended that the sacrament of marriage be extended to members of the same sex where legal in the United States. \n \n In areas where it\x92s not legal, the conference delegates recommended that the church recognize covenant commitment services for gay couples. \n \n The conference delegates also recommended the church ordain people to the various offices of priesthood regardless of their sexual orientation and relationship. \n \n Offices of priesthood in the church are deacon, teacher, priest, elder, seventy and high priest, Friend said. \n \n The changes will need to be approved by the First Presidency and Council of Twelve Apostles. \n \n Friend said it was her understanding that they would follow the recommendations of the National Conference. \n \n The process of developing, approving and implementing interim policies could take up to one year, she said. Any changes would apply only to the United States. \n \n The Community of Christ, formerly formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is based in Independence and has about 250,000 members.', 'INDEPENDENCE, Mo. — A worldwide church based in Independence, Mo., could soon change its policies on same-sex issues. \n \n Delegates with Community of Christ met at their headquarters over the weekend and have recommended to allow same-sex marriages where they are legal. \n \n “I think it will really open the doors wide in our congregations,” church member Jane Gardner said. \n \n During its national conference, more than 1,500 delegates also voted that the church should offer “commitment services” for same-sex couples in places where marriage is not legal. \n \n Gardner was one of the delegates who voted in favor of the proposed changes. She and her 27-year-old son, who’s gay, have been members of Community of Christ for a number of years. \n \n “I’m thrilled for the fact he could be ordained or he could be married in the church now,” she said. \n \n By almost a 70 percent majority, delegates also voted to ordain people regardless of sexual orientation. \n \n “It’s a journey we are all in together and we don’t necessarily all agree, but I think we want to include everybody in our faith journey,” church member Art Smith said. \n \n Church members say that journey has led to a discussion over the last several years that has led them to discussing and praying about same-sex issues. Members say they are also well aware that many believe marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman — and with the proposed changes comes criticism at the least. \n \n “We are people that believe this is the direction that God has taken us,” said Linda Booth, Director of Communications for Community of Christ. \n \n The church has nearly 250,000 members in more than 50 nations. If the changes are approved by church leaders, it would only affect Community of Christ churches in the United States.', 'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n \n The Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church)) and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are two denominations that share a common heritage in the Church of Christ founded by Joseph Smith on April 6, 1830. Since Smith\'s death in 1844, they have evolved separately in belief and practices. The LDS Church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and claims more than 15 million members worldwide;[1] the Community of Christ is headquartered in Independence, Missouri, and reports a worldwide membership of approximately 250,000.[2] \n \n Community of Christ transformation since 1960 [ edit ] \n \n Significant doctrinal, organizational, and attitudinal changes in the Community of Christ since 1960 have narrowed the similarities that remain between it and the LDS Church. While the doctrine and belief system of the LDS Church is highly centralized, systematic, and static, the Community of Christ has adopted an adaptive, decentralized, and progressive approach to doctrine. In 1997, the Community of Christ initiated a three-year period of transformation entitled “Transformation 2000,” that was seen by its president W. Grant McMurray as the culmination of a series of changes dating back to 1960.[3] McMurray identified these changes as a movement away from a belief that the denomination was ""the restored church"" and towards a position within mainstream Christianity. At the World Conference of 2000, by vote of 1,979 to 561, the name of the church was changed from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to Community of Christ. In so doing, the church was attempting to distance itself from comparisons with the LDS Church and in the process transform itself into a unique body among mainstream Christian denominations. \n \n McMurray was the first president of the Community of Christ who was not a direct descendant of Joseph Smith. He sought to formalize developments in thinking about prophetic leadership, the historical basis of the Book of Mormon, and the concept that priesthood authority had been restored in the 1820s and 1830s after centuries of apostasy. During his presidency, the church moved from a closed to an open communion and McMurray began to open the door to priesthood ordination for LGBT individuals, something which he acknowledged was already occurring. At the time, negative membership response to this issue forced McMurray to reaffirm the official policy prohibiting the ordination of sexually active gays and lesbians. The church allowed those who were ordained against policy to continue in their priesthood offices. Since 2010, gay rights have been formalized in Community of Christ doctrine.[4] \n \n Prior to 1960, the RLDS Church\'s identity was primarily tied to its differences with the larger LDS Church, which RLDS Church members usually referred to as the ""Utah Church"" or ""Mormon Church"". McMurray cited a 1960 world tour by former president W. Wallace Smith as a pivotal event impacting the evolution of RLDS Church beliefs. Leaders such as Roy Cheville had already been teaching a new generation of church members a more ecumenical and open-minded system of beliefs. But it was the church\'s proselytizing of cultures in countries outside North America that knew little about Christianity, much less Mormonism, that forced a reassessment of denominational practices and beliefs. RLDS apostle Charles Neff, a leading church missionary, pushed fellow leaders and field ministers towards a relativistic doctrinal viewpoint motivated by a combination of practical missionary concerns and an attitude of theological openness. These significant moves of the Community of Christ towards alignment with liberal Protestant doctrine were influenced in part by many in church leadership who pursued theological studies at St. Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, Missouri. While the RLDS Church had long been known for its strong anti-polygamy stance, its outreach efforts amongst the Sora people in India brought a re-examination even on this issue. \n \n Church president Wallace B. Smith’s 1984 call for the ordination of women to the priesthood was a milestone in the doctrinal evolution of the church towards progressive Christianity. During his term in office, greater attention was brought to peace and justice issues. The call to dedicate the Independence Temple to the ""pursuit of peace"" is widely regarded as both symbolic and practical evidence of the differences between the two denominations. While the LDS Church has a set of highly standardized temple rituals and regards temples as sacred space for the creation of covenants, the Community of Christ understands temples to be a less formalized center for spirituality, ministerial education, and church administration. \n \n These changes constituted a broad shift in theology of the Community of Christ from Restorationism to mainline Protestant Christianity. They also widened the scope of long-standing doctrinal differences between it and the LDS Church. Nearly all of the traditional differences between the two groups can be seen as aligning the Community of Christ more closely with traditional Christian teaching and neo-orthodoxy, which further isolates the LDS Church within Christianity as a whole. \n \n Historical differences between the churches [ edit ] \n \n The RLDS Church was founded by the confederation of a number of smaller groups that declined to migrate with Brigham Young to Utah Territory or follow any of the others vying to become the successor to Joseph Smith. Prior to the 1860 Amboy Conference, in which the church was formally ""reorganized"" into the RLDS Church, numerous doctrinal differences were espoused by the leaders of the various splinter groups. Following the reorganization, these differences were solidified into a litany of what might now be called ""wedge issues"" that would distinguish it from Young\'s LDS Church in Utah.[5] \n \n The differences enumerated below characterize the major differences between the Community of Christ and the LDS Church.[6] \n \n Scriptures [ edit ] \n \n Both churches believe in an open canon of scripture founded upon the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and revelations of God to the church recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. \n \n Bible [ edit ] \n \n The Inspired Version of the Bible is part of the Community of Christ\'s canon of scripture,[7] although it does not mandate a single translation of the Bible.[8] \n \n The LDS Church has officially adopted the Authorized King James Version for English speakers, and has produced its own edition which is extensively footnoted with clarifications from the Inspired Version. The LDS Church refers to the Inspired Version as the ""Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible."" For Spanish-speaking members, the LDS Church publishes a slightly modified version of the Reina-Valera version, including footnotes and annotations comparable to those found in its official King James Version. For other languages, the LDS Church recommends usage of specific traditional translations that are selected based on doctrinal integrity with the other official standard works. \n \n Book of Mormon [ edit ] \n \n Title page of the first edition of the Book of Mormon (1830). \n \n Both the Community of Christ and LDS Church accept the Book of Mormon as a second canon of scripture[9] and views it as an additional witness of Jesus Christ that complements the Bible. The Community of Christ publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, Herald House. The Authorized Edition is based on the original printer\'s manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or ""Kirtland Edition"") of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different[10] The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 ""Revised Authorized Edition"", which attempts to modernize some of the language.[10] \n \n The LDS Church publishes a single version of the Book of Mormon, which is extensively footnoted to the church\'s other standard works. Its chapter and versification is based upon the 1879 edition edited by Orson Pratt. \n \n At a 2007 World Conference, Community of Christ President Stephen M. Veazey ruled that a resolution to ""reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record"" was out of order.[9] He stated that ""while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.""[9] The LDS Church regularly emphasizes the importance of the Book of Mormon and encourages its members to read from it daily. \n \n Doctrine and Covenants [ edit ] \n \n Both churches publish a book called the Doctrine and Covenants and accept it as scripture.[11][12] The Community of Christ has removed several early sections[13] and has regularly added new revelations and other inspired documents to the book since the death of Joseph Smith. The LDS Church has added some material to the Doctrine and Covenants since Smith\'s death, but less than that of the Community of Christ. The Community of Christ version currently contains 166 documents, 51 of which were produced after the death of Joseph Smith. The LDS Church version currently contains 140 documents, five of which were produced after Smith\'s death. \n \n Pearl of Great Price [ edit ] \n \n The LDS Church includes the Pearl of Great Price as part of its standard works. The Community of Christ has never published or considered this book to be scripture.[11] However, the Community of Christ does accept two portions of the Pearl of Great Price—the Book of Moses and Joseph Smith–Matthew—as scripture: \n \n Chapters 2–8 of the Book of Moses are included within the Book of Genesis in the Community of Christ\'s Inspired Version of the Bible; \n \n Chapter 1 of the Book of Moses is accepted as section 22 of the Community of Christ\'s Doctrine and Covenants; \n \n In addition to appearing in the Inspired Version of the Bible, chapter 7 of the Book of Moses is accepted as section 36 of the Community of Christ\'s Doctrine and Covenants; and \n \n Joseph Smith–Matthew is accepted as part of the Book of Matthew in the Inspired Version of the Bible. \n \n Portions of the Pearl of Great Price that are not accepted as scripture by the Community of Christ are the Book of Abraham, Joseph Smith–History, and the Articles of Faith. \n \n Presidential tenure and succession [ edit ] \n \n Joseph Smith III, the successor to Joseph Smith as the Prophet-President of the Community of Christ \n \n Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church are headed by a President of the Church, a position created and held by Joseph Smith. In the LDS Church, succession to the presidency has been based on apostolic seniority. In the Community of Christ, the president has the power to appoint a successor; if the outgoing president does not appoint a successor, the Council of Twelve Apostles nominates a successor. \n \n After Smith, the next three presidents of the Community of Christ served as President of the Church until their deaths. In 1978, W. Wallace Smith broke this tradition and retired from the presidency, designated himself as ""president emeritus"", and appointed Wallace B. Smith as his successor. Wallace B. Smith and his chosen successor—McMurray—also retired from the position. In the LDS Church, every President of the Church has served until his death and none have selected a successor prior to death. \n \n The first five[14] successors to Joseph Smith in the presidency of the Community of Christ were direct descendants of Smith.[15] McMurray was the first president of the church who was not a member of the Smith family.[15] While never formally accepting a principle of lineal succession, the denomination teaches that Smith had designated his son, Joseph Smith III, as his successor.[16] In 1996, the appointment of McMurray by retiring president Wallace B. Smith was the justification used by schismatic groups that abandoned the Community of Christ. This schism led to the creation of the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The president of the Remnant Church, Frederick Niels Larsen, is a maternal great-great-grandson of Joseph Smith. \n \n The LDS Church determines its presidential successor by principles of apostolic seniority combined with inspiration from God.[17] When a church president dies, the member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who has been an apostle the longest—the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—becomes the new president of the church.[17] Prior to making the succession official, the apostles individually and collectively pray for divine guidance and confirmation of their proposed action.[17] \n \n While this is an area that marked a traditional difference between the two denominations, a 2004–05 succession crisis prompted the Council of Twelve Apostles of the Community of Christ to utilize an inspiration-seeking procedure similar to that adopted by the apostles of the LDS Church.[18] When McMurray stepped down as president in 2004, he chose not to name a successor, as previous retirees from the position had done. In 2005, Stephen M. Veazey—who was president of the Twelve, but not the senior member—was selected as successor by the Council of Twelve.[18][19] \n \n Godhead [ edit ] \n \n The Community of Christ teaches about the Trinity, which they define God as a community of three persons.[20] The LDS Church teaches that the Godhead is composed of three physically distinct personage Gods who are united—or ""one""—in purpose.[21][22] \n \n Exaltation [ edit ] \n \n The LDS Church teaches the principle of exaltation;[23] this doctrine is not accepted by the Community of Christ.[5] \n \n Adam–God doctrine [ edit ] \n \n According to Brigham Young, the Adam–God doctrine was first taught by Joseph Smith before his death in 1844. However, the evidence that Smith originated the doctrine consists only of Young\'s own assertions,[24] an 1877 recollection of Anson Call,[25] and some circumstantial evidence collected by Mormon fundamentalist writers.[26] LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball officially denounced the Adam–God doctrine in 1976.[27][28] \n \n Because the Community of Christ was founded by the confederation of a number of smaller groups that declined to accept Young\'s leadership, the Adam–God doctrine has never been a part of Community of Christ teachings, and it has maintained that the doctrine was first enunciated by Young, not Smith.[5] \n \n Priesthood eligibility [ edit ] \n \n Both churches have a tradition of bestowing the priesthood on adult male members of the church. The priesthood of the Community of Christ has always been open to persons of all races,[29] and was opened to women in 1984.[30] The LDS Church\'s priesthood is open to males only[31][32] and from the mid 1800s until 1978 was not open to people of black African descent,[31] who were sometimes characterized as ""descendants of Cain"".[33][34] The LDS Church routinely gives its Aaronic priesthood to boys 12 years of age and older, while the Community of Christ generally restricts its priesthood to adult men and women.[35] \n \n Temples [ edit ] \n \n Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church operate temples, which for both groups are separate and distinct from church chapels or meetinghouses. The Community of Christ operates two temples, the Kirtland Temple and the Independence Temple, while the LDS Church has more than 140. \n \n The Community of Christ does not practice and has traditionally objected to the idea of sacraments or rituals being performed in its temples.[5] The Community of Christ\'s temples are open to the public[36] and are dedicated to the pursuit of peace, spiritual learning, and church history and administration. LDS Church temples are open only to approved members and are primarily used for the performance of rites such as the endowment, celestial marriage, and baptism for the dead; these ordinances have never been embraced by the Community of Christ.[5] \n \n Historically, the Community of Christ did include documents in its Doctrine and Covenants[37] which sanctioned baptism for the dead and other temple rites.[5] However, the Community of Christ considers that the institution of baptism for the dead was made conditional on the completion of the Nauvoo Temple in a reasonable amount of time.[38] Because the membership of the church failed to complete the temple during Smith\'s lifetime, the Community of Christ teaches that the right to perform baptisms for the dead was withdrawn and has not been reinstituted.[38] \n \n The 1970 World Conference of the Community of Christ concluded that sections 107, 109, and 110 (regarding baptism for the dead and temple rites) had been added to the 1844 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants without proper approval of a church conference. Thus, the conference removed[13] those sections to a historical appendix.[13] The World Conference of 1990 subsequently removed the entire appendix from the Doctrine and Covenants.[13] \n \n Use of cross and other symbols [ edit ] \n \n The Community of Christ utilizes the symbol of the Christian cross on its buildings and temples.[39] The LDS Church currently does not use the cross[40] on the grounds that ""because the Savior lives, we do not use the symbol of His death as the symbol of our faith"",[41] although this aversion to the cross only became dominant in the 20th century.[42][43] \n \n Most temples of the LDS Church include a statue of the Angel Moroni on a spire,[44] but the church does not consider Moroni to be an official symbol and ""has no policy regarding the use of statues of the angel Moroni atop temples"", but rather includes or excludes a statue from each temple based on local circumstances.[45] The Community of Christ does not use the Angel Moroni as a symbol. \n \n In the United States, the Veterans Affairs (VA) emblem for headstones for LDS Church members is a stylized Angel Moroni. For the Community of Christ, the VA emblem is a stylized representation of a child standing between a lion and a lamb, which is an official logo of the Community of Christ. \n \n Polygamy [ edit ] \n \n In the 19th century, the differences between the LDS Church and the RLDS Church regarding polygamy was the principal distinction between the two churches. The LDS Church openly practiced plural marriage from 1852 to 1890 and taught that the practice was instituted by Joseph Smith and taught in secret to members of the church before his death. For many years, the leaders of the RLDS Church were vocal critics of the LDS Church\'s polygamy and argued that the practice had been introduced by Brigham Young and falsely attributed to Smith after Smith\'s death. Polygamy was frequently denounced by RLDS leaders and the practice was never accepted by the church.[46] Smith\'s son Joseph Smith III and widow Emma Smith repeatedly taught that Smith opposed the practice and was not a polygamist.[47][48][49] \n \n Today, although the Community of Christ has no official position on whether Smith was a polygamist,[46] some members now accept the historical consensus that Smith had multiple wives. Some members have argued that Smith was wrong to introduce polygamy;[46] in any case, most Community of Christ members continue to reject polygamy.[5][46] Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints opposes the practice of polygamy, its church presidents have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriage.[50] \n \n Tithing [ edit ] \n \n Traditionally, the Community of Christ taught that tithing should be calculated as one-tenth of a member\'s discretionary income.[51] The LDS Church teaches that it is ten percent of one\'s annual income,[52] with it left to the member to determine how to calculate it (e.g., what constitutes ""income"" and whether it is ten percent of income after or before tax).[53] Recently, the Community of Christ has adopted a program known as Disciples\' Generous Response, which encourages financial generosity as a response to God rather than as a set calculated obligation.[51] \n \n Apostasy and Restoration [ edit ] \n \n The LDS Church teaches that Joseph Smith restored the fullness of the gospel after a centuries long period known as the great apostasy.[54][55] The LDS Church therefore characterizes itself as a restoration of fallen Christianity and the one true church that exists.[54] In contrast, the Community of Christ has abandoned its traditional tenet that it is the one true church and has adopted a viewpoint that all faith traditions can offer a pathway to spiritual enlightenment.[56] Barbara McFarlane Higdon has called the Community of Christ a ""unique member of the body of Christ, the universal community of believers.""[57] Higdon also suggests that prior claims that the church had been ""restored"" were tantamount to idolatry. The Community of Christ has therefore moved towards ecumenism and inter-faith dialogue. Nevertheless, the Community of Christ ""steadfastly affirms the primacy of continuing revelation instead of creedal rigidity"". The Community of Christ\'s Doctrine and Covenants continues to contain documents that declare that the church is the one true church.[58] \n \n Today, the Community of Christ generally refers to Joseph Smith\'s First Vision as the ""grove experience"" and takes a flexible view about its historicity,[59] emphasizing the healing presence of God and the forgiving mercy of Jesus Christ felt by Smith.[60] In contrast, the LDS Church strongly affirms the reality of the First Vision and emphasizes its role as the beginning of the restoration of the gospel through God\'s chosen prophet. \n \n Summary chart [ edit ] \n \n Notes [ edit ]']",3,"– Another church is poised to change its thinking on gay marriage, this one with Mormon roots. Delegates from the Community of Christ have recommended allowing same-sex marriages in states where they are legal and providing ""commitment services"" in states where they are not, reports the Kansas City Star. Delegates also backed the ordination of gay people. Both moves need final approval from the church's hierarchy. The church is based in Missouri and has about 250,000 members worldwide, reports Fox4kc.com. It has its roots in the movement started by Joseph Smith Jr., though its membership is dwarfed by that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which boasts about 14 million followers."
"['jobs jobs jobs Obama’s Jobs Speech Prompted Some Reactions From Republicans \n \n As you may have heard, President Obama got up in front of Congress on Thursday night and semi-nicely asked its members to pass his newly proposed American Jobs Act ""right away."" His opponents wasted no time in sharing their thoughts with the public: \n \n Still high on his petty scheduling victory, John Boehner allowed that the plan ""merits consideration"": “It’s my hope that we can work together to end the uncertainty facing families and small businesses and create a better environment for long-term economic growth and private-sector job creation."" \n \n Michele Bachmann went a little rogue and offered an ""unsanctioned"" televised rebuttal in which she took issue with the president\'s use of the phrase ""political circus"": “It was interesting to me that if you look at the president’s remarks, almost out of the gate, the president began by insulting members of Congress ... He invited them to be a part of this address this evening And yet he began with an insult — for a circus tent.” \n \n Rick Perry was somehow not convinced: “President Obama’s call for nearly a half-trillion dollars in more government stimulus when America has more than $14 trillion in debt is guided by his mistaken belief that we can spend our way to prosperity."" \n \n Mitt Romney showed off his edgy side: The usually straitlaced former Massachusetts governor used the evening as an excuse to release some cool video art. \n \n Newt Gingrich was pedantic: ""[He] had more of a procedural issue with Obama’s speech, in which the president repeatedly called on Congress to approve his American Jobs Act: “I checked with Speaker Boehner’s office. There is no bill.\'"" \n \n Jon Huntsman stuck to Twitter: ""@BarackObama\'s tired rhetoric & failed policies haven\'t worked. My plan will actually create jobs. Join us."" \n \n Meanwhile, Herman Cain kept his statement to a Twitter-friendly length: “We waited 30 months for this?” \n \n And David Vitter? No miracle occurred, and he did not, in fact, make his football game. \n \n After jobs speech, GOP candidates jump on Obama [Politico] \n \n Despite Talk of Taming Partisanship, a Show of It for President’s Remarks [NYT]', ""But the Fed’s hair is manifestly not on fire, nor do most politicians seem to see any urgency about the situation. These days, the best — or at any rate the alleged wise men and women who are supposed to be looking after the nation’s welfare — lack all conviction, while the worst, as represented by much of the G.O.P., are filled with a passionate intensity. So the unemployed are being abandoned. \n \n Photo \n \n O.K., about the Obama plan: It calls for about $200 billion in new spending — much of it on things we need in any case, like school repair, transportation networks, and avoiding teacher layoffs — and $240 billion in tax cuts. That may sound like a lot, but it actually isn’t. The lingering effects of the housing bust and the overhang of household debt from the bubble years are creating a roughly $1 trillion per year hole in the U.S. economy, and this plan — which wouldn’t deliver all its benefits in the first year — would fill only part of that hole. And it’s unclear, in particular, how effective the tax cuts would be at boosting spending. \n \n Still, the plan would be a lot better than nothing, and some of its measures, which are specifically aimed at providing incentives for hiring, might produce relatively a large employment bang for the buck. As I said, it’s much bolder and better than I expected. President Obama ’s hair may not be on fire, but it’s definitely smoking; clearly and gratifyingly, he does grasp how desperate the jobs situation is. \n \n But his plan isn’t likely to become law, thanks to Republican opposition. And it’s worth noting just how much that opposition has hardened over time, even as the plight of the unemployed has worsened. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

First, they argued that we should rely on monetary policy rather than fiscal policy — that is, that the job of fighting unemployment should be left to the Fed. Second, they argued that fiscal actions should take the form of tax cuts rather than temporary spending. \n \n Now, however, leading Republicans are against tax cuts — at least if they benefit working Americans rather than rich people and corporations. \n \n And they’re against monetary policy, too. In Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate , Mitt Romney declared that he would seek a replacement for Ben Bernanke , the Fed chairman, essentially because Mr. Bernanke has tried to do something (though not enough) about unemployment. And that makes Mr. Romney a moderate by G.O.P. standards, since Rick Perry , his main rival for the presidential nomination, has suggested that Mr. Bernanke should be treated “pretty ugly.” \n \n So, at this point, leading Republicans are basically against anything that might help the unemployed. Yes, Mr. Romney has issued a glossy, well-produced “jobs plan,” but it might best be described as 59 bullet points with nothing there — and certainly nothing to justify his assertion, bordering on megalomania, that he would create no fewer than 11 million jobs in four years. \n \n The good news in all this is that by going bigger and bolder than expected, Mr. Obama may finally have set the stage for a political debate about job creation. For, in the end, nothing will be done until the American people demand action."", 'First reactions to the president’s big jobs speech: \n \n 1) Qua speech, it was excellent – clear, focused, unrhetorical. \n \n The core concept – stressing past Republican approval of the major elements of the proposal – ingeniously put Republicans into an awkward spot. And in fact, the maneuver has had some immediate effect. Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor told Politico tonight that they would approve important elements of the bill. \n \n The speech was tricked out with items cleverly intended to catch the ears of people who might not normally support the president: the promise to pay federal contractors faster, for example, and payroll tax cuts for smaller businesses worth up to $80,000. \n \n 2) Qua economics, the proposal looks a lot better than the 2009 stimulus. This new measure is not larded up with the Democratic wish lists and obsolete campaign promises that made such a mess of Stimulus 1. There are no tax rebates here, no Pell grants, only the basic material of a counter-cyclical program: investment tax credits, continuing payroll tax relief, and infrastructure spending. \n \n 3) Qua politics? Obama’s re-election proposition remains pretty bad, but it’s marginally less bad tonight than it was this morning. No, he has not restored the country to prosperity. But he does again at least look like he’s trying and like he’s defending Medicare and Social Security in the process. If Obama cannot run as the recovery and prosperity candidate, he will try to run as the stability and security candidate against opponents whom he will seek to depict as radical and reckless. Many of his opponents are enthusiastically cooperating with that strategy, including the current Republican presidential front-runner.', 'If President Obama\'s economic policies have had a signature flaw, it is the conceit that by pulling this or that policy lever, by spending more on this program or cutting that tax for a year, Washington can manipulate the $15 trillion U.S. economy to grow. With his speech last night to Congress, the President is giving that strategy one more government try. \n \n This is not to say that Mr. Obama hasn\'t made any intellectual progress across his 32 months in office. He now admits the damage that overregulation can do, though he can\'t do much to stop it without repealing his own legislative achievements. He now acts as if he believes that taxes matter to investment and hiring, at least for the next year. And he now sees the wisdom of fiscal discipline, albeit starting only in 2013. \n \n Yet the underlying theory and practice of the familiar ideas that the President proposed last night are those of the government conjurer. More targeted, temporary tax cuts; more spending now with promises of restraint later; the fifth (or is it sixth?) plan to reduce housing foreclosures; and more public works spending, though this time we\'re told the projects really will be shovel-ready. \n \n We\'d like to support a plan to spur the economy, which is certainly struggling. Had Mr. Obama proposed a permanent cut in tax rates, or a major tax reform, or a moratorium on all new regulations for three years, he\'d have our support. But you have to really, really believe in hope and change to think that another $300-$400 billion in new deficit spending and temporary tax cuts will do any better than the $4 trillion in debt that the Obama years have already piled up. \n \n We\'ve had the biggest Keynesian stimulus in decades. The new argument that the 2009 stimulus wasn\'t big enough isn\'t what we heard then. Americans were told it would create 3.5 million new jobs and unemployment would stay below 8% and be falling by 2011. It is now 9.1%. But this stimulus we are told will make all the difference. \n \n Mr. Obama spoke last night as if he is a converted tax-cutter, asking Republicans to expand and extend the payroll tax cut that expires in December for one more year. Along with tax credits for certain businesses that hire new employees, he says this will cut unemployment, and no doubt it will lead to some more hiring. \n \n But what happens in 2013 when those tax rates expire and Mr. Obama pledges to hit thousands of those same small businesses with higher tax rates on income, capital gains and dividends? He seems to think businesses operate only in the present and will ignore the tax burdens coming at them down the road. This is the same reasoning that assumed that postponing ObamaCare\'s tax and regulatory burdens until 2014 would have no effect on business hiring in the meantime. \n \n The same logic applies to Mr. Obama\'s claim that everything in his new proposal is ""paid for."" Yes, but only according to the usual 10-year Washington budget window that pushes all of the hard choices into the future, in this case after the election. So Mr. Obama gets to spend more now while promising to save later. This is also how the Administration claimed that a new $1 trillion health-care entitlement would reduce the deficit. It also means he can put more money in the pockets of dues-paying teachers unions and government workers. \n \n The larger political subtext of Mr. Obama\'s speech is that if Congress doesn\'t pass his plan, he\'ll then campaign against Republicans as obstructionist. Thus his speech mantra that Congress should ""pass it right away."" This ignores that Mr. Obama has been the least obstructed President since LBJ in 1965 or FDR in 1933, which is how we got here. \n \n He passed $830 billion in stimulus, $3 billion for cash for clunkers, $30 billion in small business loans, $30 billion for mortgage modification, the GM-Chrysler bailouts, ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank, credit card price controls, Build America Bonds, jobless benefits for a record 99 weeks, and more. \n \n The only priorities that a Democratic Congress blocked were cap-and-tax and union card check, and both of those would have further damaged growth and jobs. Even last December, after Republicans had retaken the House, Mr. Obama won his one-year payroll tax cut, more jobless benefits and most of what he wanted. \n \n The unfortunate reality is that even if Republicans gave Mr. Obama everything he wanted, the impact on growth would be modest at best. Washington can most help the economy with serious spending restraint, permanent tax-rate cuts, regulatory relief and repeal of ObamaCare. What won\'t help growth is more temporary, targeted political conjuring.', '7.57 pm. This was also a speech aimed directly at his own party - rallying the troops, creating a framework for the campaign ahead, betting that things are bad enough that the infrastructure spending and the tax cuts will not alienate debt-concerned independents. In style, the last thing it was was professorial. This was a blunt, potent, confident attempt to win back the hearts of a disillusioned base, while appealing to the center in ways Republicans may feel a little leery of rejecting, given their already deep reputation for obstructionism. \n \n Game on, in other words. Except this isn\'t a game. And any politician who acts like it is in the next year or so will pay a price. \n \n 7.49 pm. This was indeed a speech directed at independents and also at those who fear that America is in terminal decline. It was rooted in patriotism; it was framed to portray Obama as the pragmatic centrist he actually is. And it was not dishonest - these are the choices, short-term and long-term, that we have to make. And we should not be required to wait for another year and a half for action. \n \n One key will be how it\'s paid for. It seems that Obama is simply insisting that the super-committee should add $450 billion to its remit for long-term spending reductions, including Medicare. I cannot imagine the House GOP agreeing to that. Another key is exactly what infrastructure projects are indeed ""shovel-ready"" enough to help in the next year or two. But the general idea of building permanent infrastructure as a way to use currently idle labor seems appealingly simple to me - and a classic Depression era maneuver. \n \n 7.46 pm. Wow. A threat to take this vision across the country if the GOP doesn\'t cooperate now. That\'s Truman-speak. After months of mild attempts to get Republicans to agree, he hasn\'t caved, and he hasn\'t demonized them. But he has now upped the ante, and has new fire in his belly. If he can succeed in getting a bulk of the jobs bill through and if the super-committee doesn\'t fail, we have a chance to turn this economy around. \n \n 7.42 pm. Now we get the full-throated defense of government action as part of American history, Republican and Democrat. I think this speech could well turn his own party base around - and frame the coming year on terms more favorable to him than the Republicans. \n \n 7.39 pm. The impassioned line to be used against Perry if he\'s the candidate: \n \n We shouldn’t be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards. America should be in a race to the top. And I believe that’s a race we can win. \n \n 7.34 pm. This is the moment when Obama, rather than the GOP, ups the ante. This is what you might call aggressive conciliation. And here\'s what I\'m also hearing: a very stirring appeal to patriotism, to the idea that America can be far better than we have become today. The repetitive comparison between America and China - the appeal to global competitiveness - is one of the best ripostes to the Big Lie that this president isn\'t somehow in love with this country. \n \n 7.29 pm. My own view is that this blend of short term stimulus balanced by serious long term entitlement reform is so obviously the sanest, smartest way forward it will sink in with most Americans. And complementing it with tax reform to give taxpayers a fair shake is the icing on the cake. What\'s now clear is that he is betting big in the nest year. This is more aggressive than I have seen him since he got elected. There is a steely impatience here that is obviously designed either to get something done now, or, if not, to run a Truman-style anti-Congress presidential campaign. \n \n 7.24 pm. After small businesses, a proposal for veterans. This is a cooptation of Republican erogenous zones with strong government action. It is the message he was elected on. He\'s bringing red ideas and blue ideas for jobs. And now he\'s touting more tax cuts - daring the GOP to oppose tax cuts for the middle classes. Brilliant line: \n \n I know some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle-class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away. \n \n He\'s rocking it. \n \n 7.23 pm. A simple message: these are proposals previously backed by Democrats and Republicans. How many times has he now quite sternly said ""Pass This Bill""? \n \n 7.20 pm. A direct challenge for infrastructure investment - a patriotic challenge. Remember what I said about him staying on the ropes before he comes out swinging? This is not a milque-toast speech or a milque-toast proposal. It\'s a big bet on the country\'s desire for action, not debate. And so far, it sounds like something a sane Republican would be happy to support. \n \n 7.17 pm. An appeal to pragmatic bipartisanism in the current crisis - effective, and in the details, much more radical than I expected. And the message is even blunter: ""You should pass this bill right away."" And first off, it\'s all about tax cuts. Tax cuts. But we haven\'t quite gotten to the ""all of it is paid for"" have we? \n \n 7.13 pm. A late start. A warm reception. And a poignant admonition to the political and media class about their pettiness and narcissism. An immediate attempt to break through the usual political blah. \n \n He\'s on tonight. \n \n 7.07 pm. A new nugget from the debate last night: Rick Perry physically grabbing Ron Paul and jabbing a pointed finger in his face in a commercial break. A nasty little image for a nasty little man. \n \n 6.54 pm. A treat beforehand: Biden and Boehner talking about recent golf games. Yep, they talk about that kind of thing. Biden\'s expressions were classic, though. There is something about the way he interacts with people that makes me feel at home. I think it\'s his Catholic Irish character - even when he screws up, even when he can\'t shut up, even when he\'s pretty much unbearable. While I\'m on this Catholic kick, I should note that culturally speaking, I think Rick Perry is just not going to wear well with white Catholics. The death penalty insouciance and the healthcare callousness will hurt him with that demographic. \n \n I can\'t say I dislike Boehner either. So far, the Speaker with that wonderful tanned, drinking, smoking face has emerged as personally far more likable than Pelosi. \n \n (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty.)']",5,"– Pundits handed out good grades aplenty for President Obama's new jobs proposal last night, with generally positive feedback from liberals like Paul Krugman—but also from conservatives like David Frum and Andrew Sullivan. Krugman writes in the New York Times that he was ""favorably surprised by the new Obama jobs plan, which is significantly bolder and better than I expected."" Still, ""it's not nearly as bold as the plan I’d want in an ideal world. But if it actually became law, it would probably make a significant dent in unemployment."" Of course, Krugman holds out little hope that the GOP will let it pass. It was a ""cunning speech,"" muses David Frum on FrumForum. Economically, it's better than the 2009 stimulus, and, politically, it helps Obama's re-election chances, he adds. But the strongest aspect was using proposals Republicans had previously advocated, which ""ingeniously put Republicans into an awkward spot,"" Frum writes. ""This was a blunt, potent, confident attempt to win back the hearts of a disillusioned base, while appealing to the center in ways Republicans may feel a little leery of rejecting,"" writes Andrew Sullivan. ""Game on, in other words."" No love, though, from the Wall Street Journal.

"['Bernie Sanders (2nd row down, center) liked what he heard. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \n \n Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was the lone Democratic presidential hopeful -- and the only Jewish contender -- in the House chamber for Pope Francis\'s speech. When he left, he was beaming, as the pope had cited an American Catholic whom Sanders had plenty of praise for. \n \n ""The name Dorothy Day has not been used in the United States Congress terribly often,"" said Sanders in a short interview. ""She was a valiant fighter for workers, was very strong in her belief for social justice, and I think it was extraordinary that he cited her as one of the most important people in recent American history. This would be one of the very, very few times that somebody as radical as Dorothy Day was mentioned."" \n \n Pope Francis says Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton embody the spirit of America. (AP) \n \n Day was arguably the least famous of the four Americans Francis cited in the speech, but she was a vital and controversial figure on the American left. Like Martin Luther King -- also cited by Francis -- she had a thick FBI file, compiled by agents tracking her support for democratic socialism and opposition to foreign wars. ""We need to change the system,"" Day wrote in 1956. ""We need to overthrow, not the government, as the authorities are always accusing the Communists \'of conspiring to teach [us] to do,\' but this rotten, decadent, putrid industrial capitalist system which breeds such suffering in the whited sepulcher of New York."" \n \n [Who were Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton?] \n \n Recent support for Day\'s possible canonization has angered some conservatives. ""Vatican archives are filled with reports of Christians martyred under the regimes that Dorothy Day supported,"" wrote Virginia State Senator Dick Black in a 2013 letter to Francis\'s predecessor, Pope Benedict. ""I am revolted by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ support for the canonization of a woman whose views supported the violent extermination of Christians throughout the world."" \n \n In Pope Francis\' address to Congress, he praised Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker Movement for her ""passion for justice."" The Rev. James Martin explains in this excerpt from ""Dorothy Day: Who Cares About the Saints?"" (The Rev. James Martin and Loyola Productions) \n \n Sanders, well aware of Day\'s views and her critics, considered it bold and telling that Francis would praise her.

Capturing the cross-ideological appeal of the pope's overall message, she was also a fierce opponent of birth control and abortion. \n \n Huddling with reporters as Sanders walked by Statuary Hall, which connects the House and Senate wings, was Texas Senator Ted Cruz. He praised the pope's message as “powerful” when it came to protecting the family unit, religious liberty, and protecting and defending “human life at every stage” of development. \n \n “Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for life at a time when life is profoundly threatened in America,” Cruz said. “Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for marriage at a time when five unelected judges are seeking to tear down marriage laws across this country. And Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for religious liberty at a time when the Obama administration is waging a relentless war against religious liberty.” \n \n Cruz said the speech should make President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden “awfully nervous” as it relates to religious liberty as well as the debate about whether to defund Planned Parenthood, a group that provides women's health services, including abortion. (Bloomberg Philanthropies provides financial support for Planned Parenthood.) \n \n “It was striking, and heartbreaking, to see so many congressional Democrats sitting stone-faced, arms crossed, when the pope urged us all to defend human life,” Cruz said. \n \n Cruz needled the press for writing “amusing and slanted” stories suggesting the pope's visit to the United States was good for Democrats. \n \n The Texas senator, an outspoken critic of illegal immigration, sounded less moved by Pope Francis' impassioned call to be compassionate toward people who “travel north in search of a better life,” a reference to the recent wave of undocumented immigrants to the U.S., many of whom have fled violence in Central America. \n \n “When we speak of welcoming immigrants, I believe that should refer to legal immigrants,” said Cruz, who noted that he's the “son of an immigrant who came from Cuba legally.” He added that “we should celebrate legal immigrants” and “show compassion to people across the globe.” \n \n In his long section on immigration, Pope Francis, a son of Italian immigrants to Argentina, said, “We the people of this continent are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants.” \n \n One presidential candidate who was visibly moved by that remark was Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a son of Cuban immigrants, who smiled and wiped away a tear as he watched in the House chamber. \n \n https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/647067850486759424"", 'Story highlights Bernie Sanders said Pope Francis\' decision to highlight Dorothy Day underscores the Pontiff\'s emphasis on helping the poor \n \n Sanders called the Pope \'one of the great moral and religious leaders of our time\' \n \n Washington (CNN) Vermont Sen.

Sanders also acknowledged, per CNN, that Francis likely ""touched on some very, very important issues that a lot of people would prefer not to talk about,"" but he adds the pope approached them in a ""very dignified, non-partisan type way."" Someone from the other side of the political spectrum is gushing about the pontiff's speech, too, but for different reasons.

"['Nola, one of just four endangered northern white rhinos left in the world, died Sunday at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. \n \n The 41-year-old rhino had been under veterinary care for a bacterial infection and age-related health issues. Her condition took a turn for the worse over the weekend, San Diego Zoo Global said in a statement. Early Sunday morning, the Safari Park team “made the difficult decision to euthanize her.” \n \n It is a crushing loss for the Safari Park, where Nola had lived since 1989. The gentle 4,000-pound animal was a favorite with the staff because of her sociable personality and love of back scratches. She was also a popular attraction for Safari Park visitors, who could always spot her because of her distinctively curved horn. \n \n Nola’s death is also a blow to the northern white rhino sub-species. After decades of poaching, there are now just three northern white rhinos left in the world. All three — a male and two females — live on the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. \n \n The source of Nola’s lingering infection was recently traced to a large abscess deep in her pelvic region. Veterinarians performed a minor surgical procedure to drain the abscess on Nov. 13, and the majority of the infected material was removed. But her condition began rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, and the decision was made to euthanize her. \n \n “It sounds corny, but with her, every day is a blessing,” lead keeper Jane Kennedy said last month, when she and her fellow Safari Park staff members were keeping an eye on Nola’s condition. “I would call her a symbol of our purpose. She truly represents what we are all dedicating our lives to.” \n \n Nola had been caught in the Sudan when she was approximately 2 years old. She came to the Safari Park in 1989 from the Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic as part of a breeding program. But she and her fellow northern whites had already made a big impression on her new hosts. \n \n “I met Nola and her group of rhinos in July of 1986, when I traveled to what was then the Czech Soviet Republic. The Soviet Army was there, and so was this group of northern white rhinos,” said Oliver Ryder, director of genetics, Kleberg Chair, San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research. “The last week I was there, a baby rhino was born. It made a big impression on me because these enormous creatures were so gentle and so cautious and curious with this baby rhino. I was impressed yet again that there is a depth to their lives that we don’t understand.” \n \n The hope was that Nola would mate with Angalifu, the Safari Park’s northern white rhino male. The mating happened, but there was never a pregnancy. At one point, staffers sawed off the horns of Nola and fellow female, Noti, to keep them from fighting Angalifu off. But without herd behavior to spur more frequent mating, there were never any northern white births at the Safari Park. \n \n And then, there were fewer northern white rhinos altogether. Noti died in 2007, and Angalifu died last December. And in July, Nabire, a female northern white rhino living in the Dvur Kralove Zoo, died at the age of 32. \n \n So when Nola was put on medical watch earlier this year due to a sinus infection, the whole rhino-watching world began to worry. In May, she began receiving treatment for an abscess on her right hip. The life expectancy of the white rhino species, which includes northern and southern white rhinos, is 40 to 50 years. But when Nola’s abscess and the bacterial infection that it caused came back in September, the Safari Park community was on high alert. \n \n “It’s tough. It’s like having your 90-year-old aunt get sick, and there is nothing you can do except give her basic care and keep her comfortable,” keeper Kennedy said last month, as she watched Nola recline in the shade of her Safari Park enclosure, with her companion southern white rhino, Chuck, nearby. “When her abscess came back the second time, you could tell she didn’t feel good. When her attitude sinks, ours has to jump up because we need to help her.” \n \n For Kennedy and her fellow members of Team Nola, helping the rhino was both a priority and a privilege. And the rhino made it easy. Due to an irregularity in her hooves, Nola needed regular nail trimmings. The constant interactions with the keepers made her comfortable with human contact and usually a cinch to work with, despite her massive size. \n \n She did not like being in her boma corral and she was not at all fond of taking her many antibiotic pills. But she loved her pedicures and her back scratches and hanging out in her 65-acre African Plains habitat with the equally sociable Chuck, who was very eager to track her whereabouts when Nola was getting her abscess drained last week. \n \n “They are like the elderly couple who met late in life and became friends,” Kennedy said of Chuck and Nola. “I’ve known Nola for 26 years, and she is truly, truly one of the sweetest animals I have ever worked with.” \n \n With neither of the Ol Pejeta northern white females able to give birth naturally due to advanced age or reproductive issues, it is up to science to save the sub-species. The San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research’s Frozen Zoo contains viable cell cultures from 12 different northern white rhinos. Genetic materials from Nola have been preserved, and the plan was always to collect her ovaries and any viable stem cells upon her death. \n \n With the help of in-vitro fertilization, the hope is to use the recently arrived southern white rhinos living in the Safari Park’s new Rhino Rescue Center as surrogates for a hybrid rhino, which would be created with northern white sperm and southern white eggs. \n \n San Diego Zoo Global has one of the world’s most successful rhino breeding programs. To date, a total of 94 southern white rhinos, 68 greater one-horned rhinos and 14 black rhinos have been born at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. As the genomic research, technology and procedures become more advanced, the goal would be to create complete northern white rhino embryos, which the southern whites would carry to term. \n \n Nola’s legacy will live on, and not just in the hearts and minds of the people who cared for her. \n \n “The white rhinos represent the wild places and prehistoric animals that are still with us,” said Steve Metzler, interim associate curator of mammals, who accompanied the Rhino Rescue Center’s six southern whites on their 22-hour flight from Johannesburg to San Diego. “It is devastating to think that in just a few hundred years, we can wipe that out. That is just wrong, and we need to do something about it.” \n \n karla.peterson@sduniontribune.com ▪ (619) 293-1275', 'The San Diego Zoo Safari Park is absolutely \n \n incredible \n \n ... \n \n staff, and so much to do that it will easily take up your entire day.

She was one of the last four remaining members of the doomed species, and the park decided to euthanize her on Sunday because of an infection and other chronic age-related health problems, reports the New York Times. ""It's tough. It's like having your 90-year-old aunt get sick, and there is nothing you can do except give her basic care and keep her comfortable,"" the lead zookeeper told the San Diego Union-Tribune last month. Another female died at a Czech zoo in July, and the final three survivors are all at a conservancy in Kenya. ""Let this be a warning of what is happening to wildlife everywhere,"" the park wrote in a Facebook post. But hope for the species lives on: The zoo's ""frozen"" section now has genetic material from at least a dozen northern whites, and scientists hope to bring back the species with embryos that can be carried by southern white rhinos, six of which recently arrived at the park, the Union-Tribune reports.

""It is devastating to think that in just a few hundred years, we can wipe that out. That is just wrong, and we need to do something about it.""

"['House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol last week. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) \n \n First, Pelosi said of the deal: “We all may not be able to support it, or none us may be able to support it.” Then, later in the evening she folowed up with this lukewarm comment: “I look forward to reviewing the legislation with my caucus to see what level of support we can provide.” \n \n Pelosi, a savvy political operator, understands that the bill — backed by all of the other major congressional leaders and President Obama — will pass. \n \n Her reaction then is best understood as equal parts caucus politics and message-sending to the White House. \n \n There’s no question that liberals in the House — of which Pelosi is very much one — are not happy with the deal. \n \n The idea of more than $1 trillion in immediate cuts with no tax or revenue increases to offset them had the progressive caucus and the black caucus up in arms. \n \n Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, called the deal “a sugar-coated Satan sandwich” — a sentiment reflected (if not so colorfully) in a number of public comments from liberals Sunday \n \n That’s not insignificant to Pelosi’s own politics because liberals comprise an even larger chunk of the Democratic caucus in the House than they did two years ago thanks the destruction of moderate and conservative Blue Dogs in the 2010 election. \n \n The key to Pelosi’s success in the House — demonstrated in her ability to hold on as leader after Democrats lost the majority in 2010 — is her strength among liberals in the caucus. \n \n Looking as though she happily and quickly signed off on a deal that will leave many House liberals deeply unhappy would badly undermine Pelosi’s appeal to her base. And she’s smart enough not to do that. \n \n There’s also some history — dating back to before the 2010 election — between the White House and Pelosi/House Democrats that explains her comments about the compromise. \n \n Democrats in the lower chamber have fumed, mostly privately, about what they believe is a not only a dismissive attitude toward them from the White House but also a favoritism toward the Senate. \n \n Pelosi wants to make a point here — that the White House can cut all the deals it want but that she and the Democratic House caucus won’t immediately fall in line if it’s not in their own political or policy interests to do so. \n \n Ultimately, Pelosi is a team player and won’t urge her Democratic colleagues to rob President Obama of the deal he desperately wants/needs heading into 2012. \n \n But that doesn’t mean Pelosi won’t take her time — or maybe even vote against the compromise deal. \n \n “I think she will not let it die even if in the end she votes against it,” predicted one Pelosi confidante. \n \n Priorities USA leans on single donor: A new super PAC started by former Obama aides raised $3.2 million in the first half of 2011, with most of it coming from just one donor, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday. \n \n DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg accounted for $2 million of the total raised by Priorities USA Action. Another $1 million came from Chicago businessman Fred Eychaner and the Service Employees International Union’s PAC, who gave half a million each. Most of the other $160,000 came from 23 donors. \n \n As a whole, Priorities USA Action and its nonprofit arm, Priorities USA, raised $5 million. The Fix reported Friday that Priorities USA and several other Democratic-aligned outside groups combined to raise $10 million in the first six months of this year. \n \n Compared to the $20 million that a Republican-leaning group associated with the American Crossroads super PAC just spent on its summer ad blitz, and Democrats are still fighting from behind when it comes to outside groups. \n \n Meanwhile, hedge fund manager John Paulson and hotel executive J.W.

Just because Obama has House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) in agreement, the vote on the plan, scheduled for Monday, is not necessarily a done deal. \n \n Not only will Boehner have to convince more than half of the House’s 240 Republican members to vote in favor of the bill, but problems lurk within the chamber’s blue seats as well. \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said that she would have to speak to her members and look at the deal more closely before assuring votes. \n \n “We all may not be able to support it — or none of us may be able to support it,” she told Bloomberg. \n \n The Progressive Caucus and the Black Caucus have scheduled a press conference for Monday to outline why they are opposed to the deal, which would raise the debt ceiling and cut around $1 trillion in spending over the next decade. \n \n “This deal does not even attempt to strike a balance between more cuts for the working people of America and a fairer contribution from millionaires and corporations,” Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) said in a statement Sunday night. “I will not be a part of it.” \n \n The Black Caucus Sunday released a letter urging Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment and take the debt crisis into his own hands, something the president had said he was unwilling to do. \n \n In a floor speech Sunday prior to the deal announcement, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) encouraged the same. \n \n Trouble also lurks, more familiarly, to Obama’s right. \n \n “This isn’t the greatest deal in the world,” Boehner said in a statement Sunday night, urging a vote as soon as possible. “But it shows how much we’ve changed the terms of the debate in this town.” \n \n Boehner and other conservatives have faced resistance from those Republicans who represent tea party ideals. Tomorrow’s vote is sure to be another tea party standoff. \n \n “I’m afraid this is not going to fix the problem, and that’s the one reason I came here,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-TX), who was elected by tea party constituents. \n \n Obama, for one, realized that the vote has not happened yet, and encouraged Americans to continue to contact their members of Congress to express support for the plan. \n \n “We’re not done yet,” he said Sunday night.', 'President Barack Obama’s rightward lurch to reach a $3 trillion deficit reduction deal with no guarantee of additional revenues had liberals fuming and Republicans all but declaring victory Sunday afternoon. \n \n With time running out to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling before Tuesday’s default deadline, Obama moved dramatically in the direction of the GOP, according to Senators and aides in both parties. \n \n As details trickled out Sunday, the deal framework appeared to give Republicans most of what they were seeking — with about $3 trillion in guaranteed spending cuts but no tax increases, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday. \n \n “We are going to deal with this problem the American people sent us here to deal with, which is that the government has been spending too much,” the Kentucky Republican said on CNN. \n \n In return, Obama, whose poll numbers are at all-time lows, gets to avoid another debt ceiling battle before voters head to polls in November 2012, and he will be able to argue that he was willing to compromise to help save the country from a default crisis. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) also signed off on the deal late Sunday afternoon, “pending caucus approval,” said his spokesman, Adam Jentleson. \n \n But first, the president and Democratic leaders could face a backlash from liberals angry that they appear to have agreed to a revenue-free debt ceiling bill that includes a “trigger” only for automatic cuts in defense, Medicare and other programs if a second deficit reduction package isn’t enacted by the end of this year. \n \n Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said early reports of the new deal appeared to be “a sugar-coated Satan sandwich.” The Missouri Democrat said the CBC hadn’t yet made a formal declaration that the group would oppose it, “but this is a shady bill.” \n \n “This deal trades people’s livelihoods for the votes of a few unappeasable right-wing radicals, and I will not support it,” ripped Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, before House Democrats had even been briefed. “The lesson today is that Republicans can hold their breath long enough to get what they want.” \n \n For weeks, liberals have feared that Obama would give in to Republican demands for trillions in spending cuts without a guarantee of “sacrifice” from the wealthy. In a last-ditch effort to stop such a deal, progressive lawmakers amped up their calls that Obama simply ignore the debt ceiling and use the 14th Amendment as a justification. \n \n The White House tried to tamp down the liberal unrest by making it clear that Obama still wants revenue in a final deficit reduction package later this year. That deal would be crafted by a new joint committee, which would be created under the tentative agreement. \n \n National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said on CNN that Obama would still insist on a balanced package that includes tax reform, and he noted that the president still does not support anything that would cut benefits for seniors without asking the wealthy to sacrifice as well. \n \n But there is no guarantee that Republicans will give an inch on revenues. \n \n One senior House Democratic aide said the deal appeared to be so bad for the Democrats that it might get fewer than 50 votes from their side. That could force Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to corral the vast bulk of the votes from his Conference. \n \n Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, predicted more optimistically that 80 Democrats would back it. \n \n “While we’re a very diverse Caucus, at the end of the day, we’re not going to put our ideology ahead of the good of the country,” the Oregon Democrat said. \n \n Still, Obama may have some persuading to do in order to get his Democratic colleagues on board. \n \n “I think the president will come in here and sell whatever agreement he comes to,” Schrader predicted. \n \n Selling the package to House Republicans, meanwhile, could be a lot easier given that the deal builds off of Boehner’s own bill. The package that was emerging Sunday afternoon would eliminate the requirement that a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution be passed and sent to the states — but it would include at least a vote on such a proposal in both chambers. \n \n Sen. Carl Levin said the president did not appear to be willing to make the sustained argument that the wealthy pay their fair share but would at least have another chance next year when the Bush tax cuts are set to expire and the nation’s credit rating isn’t on the line. \n \n “The question is how hard he will fight,” the Michigan Democrat said. \n \n Several Senate Democrats appeared resigned to backing a revenue-free deal, even as the details were still being ironed out. \n \n “I think not having revenues is a mistake, but it may be all we can do at this point,” Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said. \n \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said, “I’m not pleased with having it happen this way.” She added she would probably back it “because I think the worst possible thing is for us not to pay our bills.” \n \n Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) also said on CNN that Democrats would still push to have revenue included in a final package to be negotiated later by a new 12-person joint deficit reduction committee. That committee would be empowered to send a package without amendment to the House and Senate floors for up-or-down votes by Thanksgiving. \n \n Some Democrats said the political consequences of the joint committee failing to act would hit the GOP more than on the president’s party. Talks on the details of a trigger, which several Senators and aides said was still being tweaked Sunday, included accommodations that would make it more palatable to Democrats. \n \n Though the trigger would force cuts to Medicare, those cuts would come from Medicare providers rather than beneficiaries directly, Democratic Senators and aides said. And large defense cuts are intended to bring the GOP to the table to compromise. \n \n Levin said that if the trigger affected Medicare benefits directly, very few Democrats could support it. \n \n One advantage of such a trigger is that it would create a large array of powerful interests — from defense contractors to health care providers — who would have a huge stake in the passage of a second deficit reduction plan. \n \n And there is also a political advantage to the trigger for Democrats as well. If Republicans opted to pull the trigger rather than agree to any tax increases, Democrats could blast them in the 2012 campaign as hurting seniors to protect millionaires and billionaires. \n \n “That gives a political argument, but in the meantime, there’s a hell of a lot of damage done to average people in this country,” Levin said. \n \n Some Democrats were still looking to sweeten the deal Sunday afternoon, with Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) saying he hopes the package will extend the payroll tax cut for another year. \n \n The joint deficit committee inspired fear in both parties. Some liberal groups think it has too much power to slash entitlements, while some conservatives are afraid it could be a way to force through a tax increase. \n \n But Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed such concerns. A tax increase would “never pass the House,” he said. \n \n Reid, who conceived the committee idea, said “it will be essential to choose members with open minds willing to consider every option — even when those options are tough pills to swallow for both parties. Cooperation is the only way forward.” \n \n Jessica Brady, Meredith Shiner and John Stanton contributed to this report.']",3,"– Liberals are just a wee bit unhappy with the deal President Obama struck to increase the debt ceiling. The Progressive Caucus and the Black Caucus will hold a press conference today to announce their opposition to the deal, Raw Story reports. Black Caucus Chairman Emanuel Cleaver delivered the real money quote yesterday, telling Roll Call that based on early reports, the pact looked like “a sugar-coated Satan sandwich.” Rep. Cleaver stood by the quote in an MSNBC interview, saying the bill was “antithetical to everything the great religions of the world teach, which is take care of the poor, take care of the aged.” He said he still needed to review the details, “but on the surface, it looks like a Satan sandwich.” Nancy Pelosi meanwhile darkly hinted that “We all may not be able to support it, or none us may be able to support it.” But Washington Post sources say Pelosi is just firing a warning shot past a dismissive White House, and won't actually block the bill."

"['The Obama administration reaffirmed Wednesday its decision to designate polar bears as a ""threatened,"" not ""endangered,"" species, in defiance of the wishes of conservationists who say the bears are in danger of extinction because their arctic hunting grounds are melting. \n \n The administration was under a court-imposed deadline to decide whether it would upgrade the bears\' status to ""endangered."" \n \n The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told a U.S. District Court judge Wednesday that the threatened designation will not change because polar bears were not considered to be in danger of extinction at the time of the listing in 2008. \n \n ""The Service explained how its biologists had concluded in 2008 that the polar bear was not facing sudden and catastrophic threats [and] was still a widespread species that had not been restricted to a critically small range or critically low numbers,"" the agency said in a statement. \n \n Threatened species receive most of the same regulatory protections as those listed under the Endangered Species Act, including a requirement that federal agencies refrain from actions that might jeopardize their existence or destroy or harm their habitat. \n \n Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the administration\'s decision ""a huge disappointment.""

More »', 'Ignoring calls from environmentalists to revisit the status of the polar bear, the Obama administration outlined yesterday its legal reasoning for why it should be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. \n \n The Fish and Wildlife Service was responding to a court order requiring it to further explain why polar bears should be considered threatened rather than endangered, which is a higher threat level. \n \n Environmentalists argue that the bear should be listed as endangered, while industry groups say it shouldn\'t be listed at all. \n \n Last month, in the court case arising from the dispute over the bear\'s status, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan of the District of Columbia ordered FWS to provide a more detailed legal basis for its position, which is in line with the stance taken by the George W. Bush administration when it first listed polar bears as threatened in 2008 (E&ENews; PM, Nov. 4). \n \n There was never any indication from the government that it planned to change its position, although environmental groups challenging the listing, including the Center for Biological Diversity, had hoped that it would. \n \n The memorandum filed with the court focused on the phrase ""in danger of extinction,"" which is used in the ESA to define what constitutes an endangered species. Sullivan said the meaning of the phrase was unclear. \n \n Under Supreme Court precedent, when the meaning of a statutory phrase is not easily discernible, government agencies have discretion to interpret the law, within certain boundaries. \n \n Environmentalists have presented evidence that they say shows that the bear is in danger of extinction, but FWS maintains that, under its interpretation of the statute, a species is only endangered when it is ""currently on the brink of extinction in the wild."" \n \n When analyzing the polar bear, the agency found that the species ""has not been restricted to a critically small range or critically low numbers, and has yet to suffer any substantial reduction in numbers or range,"" the memorandum says. \n \n The polar bear does ""face a serious threat"" and is ""likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future,"" the government concedes. \n \n The findings justify a listing as threatened, which is defined in the ESA as a species ""which is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future,"" the agency added. \n \n The court case has implications beyond the polar bear because environmentalists would like to see the Endangered Species Act used as a tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n If the polar bear were listed as endangered, the government could be required to act to curb emissions to protect its habitat. \n \n As long as the bear is listed as threatened, that cannot happen because of a Bush-era regulation, retained by the Obama administration, that states that a finding that polar bears were covered by the ESA could not be used as grounds for reducing greenhouse gas emissions nationwide. The regulation only applies to a threatened listing. \n \n Andrew Wetzler, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, conceded he hadn\'t expected the government to change its position, but he said it was a lost opportunity for the administration. \n \n ""One would hope that the growing scientific consensus about the warming of the Arctic would have spurred them into action,"" he added. \n \n The legal fight is not yet over.

"['FILE - In this Dec. 13, 2004 file photo, Jack Whittaker heads toward the Putnam County Judicial Annex in Winfield, W.Va. Whittaker won the $315 million Powerball jackpot in 2002, but fell victim to scandals,... (Associated Press) \n \n With a half-billion-dollar multistate lottery jackpot up for grabs, plenty of folks are fantasizing about how to spend the money. But doing it the right way _ protecting your riches, your identity and your sanity _ takes some thought and planning. \n \n Making sure you don\'t blow the nation\'s largest-ever lottery jackpot within a few years means some advice is in order before the Mega Millions drawing Friday, especially if you\'re really, really, really lucky. \n \n Q: What do I do with the ticket? \n \n A: Before anything else, sign the back of the ticket. That will stop anyone else from claiming your riches if you happen to drop it while you\'re jumping up and down. Then make a photocopy and lock it in a safe. At the very least, keep it where you know it\'s protected. A Rhode Island woman who won a $336 million Powerball jackpot in February hid the ticket in her Bible before going out to breakfast. \n \n Q: What next? \n \n A: Relax; breathe; take time to think about your next move. Don\'t do anything you\'ll regret for the next 30 years, like calling your best friend or every one of your aunts, uncles and cousins. It doesn\'t take long to be overwhelmed by long-lost friends, charities and churches wanting to share your good fortune. You\'ve waited a lifetime to hit the jackpot; you can wait a few days before going on a spending spree. \n \n Q: So whom should I tell first? \n \n A: Contacting a lawyer and a financial planner would be a lot wiser than updating your Facebook status. Make sure it\'s someone you can trust and, it\'s hoped, dealt with before. If you don\'t have anyone in mind, ask a close family member or friend. Oklahoma City attorney Richard Craig, whose firm has represented a handful of lottery winners, says it\'s essential to assemble a team of financial managers, tax experts, accountants and bankers. \n \n Q: Remind me, how much did I win? \n \n A: As it stands now, the Mega Millions will pay out a lump sum of $359 million before taxes. The annual payments over 26 years will amount to just over $19 million before taxes. \n \n Q: How much will I pay in taxes? \n \n A: This partly depends on where you live. Federal tax is 25 percent; then there\'s your state income tax. In Ohio, for example, that\'s another 6 percent. And you might need to pay a city tax depending on the local tax rules. So count on about a third of your winnings going to the government. \n \n Q: Should I take the cash payout or annual payments? \n \n A: This is the big question, and most people think taking the lump sum is the smart move. That\'s not always the case. First, spreading the payments out protects you from becoming the latest lottery winner who\'s lost all their money. Don McNay, author of the book ""Son of a Son of a Gambler: Winners, Losers and What to Do When You Win the Lottery,"" says nine out of 10 winners go through their money in five years or less. ""It\'s too much, too fast,"" he says. ""Nobody is around them putting the brakes on the situation."" \n \n Q: But what if I\'m good at managing the money? \n \n A: Invested properly, the lump sum option can be a good choice. There\'s more planning that you can use to reduce estate taxes and other financial incentives. Others, though, say that with annual payments, you are taxed on the money only as it comes in, so that will put you in a lower tax bracket rather than taking a big hit on getting a lump sum. And you still can shelter the money in tax-free investments and take advantage of tax law changes over the years. \n \n Q: Should I try to shield my identity? \n \n A: Absolutely. This will protect you from people who want you to invest in their business scheme or those who need cash in an emergency. Lottery winners are besieged by dozens of people and charities looking for help. ""There are people who do that for a living. Unless you understand that, you can become a victim very quickly,"" says Steve Thornton, an attorney in Bowling Green, Ky., who has represented two jackpot winners. \n \n Q: So how can I protect myself? \n \n A: Again, it somewhat depends on where you live. In Ohio, you can form a trust to manage the money and keep your winnings a secret. In other states, you can form a trust but still be discovered through public records. And a few states require you to show up and receive your oversized check in front of a bunch of cameras, making it impossible to stay anonymous. Thornton set up a corporation in the late 1990s to protect the identity of a client in Kentucky who won $11 million. ""No one had done this before, and there were legal questions about whether a corporation can win,"" he says. ""We were able to hide their names."" \n \n Q: Is it OK to splurge a little? \n \n A: Sure, it\'s why you bought a ticket, right? ""Get it out of your system, but don\'t go overboard,"" McNay says. But remember that if there\'s a new Mercedes-Benz in the driveway, your neighbors will probably be able to figure out who won the jackpot. \n \n Q: How much should I help my family and others? \n \n A: It\'s certainly a natural desire to help relatives in need and take care of future generations. But use extreme caution when giving out your money. Jack Whittaker, a West Virginia contractor who won a nearly $315 million Powerball jackpot in 2002, quickly fell victim to scandals, lawsuits and personal setbacks. His foundation spent $23 million building two churches, and he\'s been involved in hundreds of legal actions. ""If you win, just don\'t give any money away, because the more money you give away, the more they want you to give. And once you start giving it away, everybody will label you an easy touch and be right there after you. And that includes everybody,"" Whittaker said five years ago. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Vicki Smith in Morgantown, W.Va., contributed to this report.', 'The logic seems sound: The more lottery tickets you buy, the better your odds of striking it rich. \n \n So when the Mega Millions jackpot hit a record $540 million Thursday, it was only natural for some Houstonians to pool their resources with friends and colleagues to buy as many tickets as possible. After all, there are plenty of millions to go around. The more the merrier. \n \n Gary Grief, executive director of Texas Lottery Commission, said he encourages pools, provided that, as with all lottery wagering, they are conducted responsibly. \n \n ""My advice is to formalize those agreements unless you are dealing with people you completely trust - and trust, potentially, with hundreds of millions,"" said Grief, who also serves as lead director of Mega Millions. \n \n Six construction workers in New Jersey learned that lesson the hard way. \n \n The co-workers had pooled their money for years to play the lotto. They relied on one member of their group, Americo Lopes, to purchase the tickets. In November 2009, one of the tickets he bought hit the $38.5 million jackpot. Lopes cashed it without telling his co-workers, and walked away with more than $17 million in one lump sum after taxes. \n \n Lopes later claimed he bought the winning ticket with his own money, not funds collected from the group, but on March 14 a Union County jury ruled that he had cheated his co-workers out of their fair shares. The jury ordered Lopes to share the jackpot. \n \n ""Money can make people do some really funny things,"" said Joseph Gagnon, a Houston attorney who specializes in management, labor and employment matters. \n \n There is nothing illegal about office pools to buy lotto tickets because lotteries are sanctioned by the government, Gagnon said. But he recommended using common sense and caution. \n \n Make copies \n \n It\'s a good idea to make copies of tickets and distribute them to pool participants before the drawing, Gagnon said. That way, everyone knows what the numbers are. People also can sign a written agreement naming the participants in the pool, how much they\'re going to contribute, and how the group will divide the proceeds if they win. \n \n ""You never think about these things until after you won,"" Gagnon said. ""That\'s the problem, and that\'s what makes the litigation necessary."" \n \n Even if everyone in a winning pool is trustworthy, what happens to the unlucky folks in the office who didn\'t join in? \n \n In 1997, almost half the staff in the Dallas County public defender\'s office won a $45 million jackpot. Twenty-three co-workers received $56,000 a year for 25 years after taxes. \n \n The other half of the office got nothing, including lawyer John McLauchlan. \n \n ""The first couple days after it happened, my stomach hurt,"" he told the Chronicle at the time. \n \n Texas has participated in Mega Millions for about 10 years, and has had eight jackpot winners. The biggest haul - $144 million - went to William Kiefer of Katy in January 2010. \n \n The drawing for the current $540 million jackpot is Friday evening. \n \n Reporter Carol Christian contributed to this article. \n \n lindsay.wise@chron.com']",2,"– You're probably not going to hit the jackpot in tonight's $540 million Mega Millions drawing—but what if you do? First of all, if you bought a bunch of tickets with a pool of co-workers or friends, you might want to take a moment to write up a formal agreement before the 11pm ET drawing, the Houston Chronicle reports. Another good idea: distribute photocopies of the tickets to each pool member. ""You never think about these things until after you won,"" one attorney says. ""And that's what makes the litigation necessary."" The AP offers more tips for after you win: DO sign the back of the ticket, make a copy, and hide it or lock it up somewhere safe. DON'T call everyone you know to tell them the good news—soon you'll be overwhelmed with people hoping to share in your newfound riches. DO get in touch with a lawyer and a financial planner—preferably people you trust. Can't think of anyone? Ask a trusted family member or friend for a recommendation. DON'T make your identity public if you don't have to. Depending on where you live, you may be able to form a trust and keep your identity private. DO think long and hard about whether to take the lump sum ($359 million before taxes) or the annual payments (about $19 million per year, before taxes, for 26 years). There are benefits and drawbacks to both, and the final decision will likely depend on how good you are at managing money—and what your tax advisor says.

"['WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Ways and Means Committee voted Wednesday to refer a former Internal Revenue Service official to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution in the agency\'s tea party controversy. \n \n Committee investigators say they have uncovered evidence that Lois Lerner may have violated the constitutional rights of conservative groups, misled investigators and risked exposing confidential taxpayer information. \n \n Lerner, who retired last year, headed the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status. The agency has acknowledged that agents improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status from 2010 to 2012. \n \n ""We think there\'s reason to believe that laws were broken, that constitutional rights were violated,"" said committee chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich. ""We have to make sure that the signal goes out that this can\'t happen again."" \n \n The Ways and Means Committee has been investigating the IRS for nearly a year, since shortly after the mishandling of tea party applications became public. Wednesday\'s vote to refer the matter to the Justice Department was 23-14, with all Republicans voting in favor and all Democrats voting against. \n \n Democratic leaders said the vote was a political stunt designed to fire up the Republican base in an election year. They noted that the Justice Department is already investigating whether any crimes have been committed. \n \n ""It now seems clear that Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee have decided that they do not want to be left behind in the Republican campaign to declare this a scandal and keep it going until November,"" said Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the committee\'s ranking Democrat. \n \n Lerner\'s lawyer issued a statement Wednesday declaring her innocence. \n \n ""This is just another attempt by Republicans to vilify Ms. Lerner for political gain,"" said the lawyer, William W. Taylor III. ""Ms. Lerner has done nothing wrong. She did not violate any law or regulation. She did not ?mislead Congress. She did not interfere with the rights of any organization to a tax exemption. ?Those are the facts."" \n \n Levin said Camp could have simply transmitted the information to the appropriate authorities at the Justice Department, without making it public. \n \n Camp defended making it public. \n \n ""Look, the potential violation of constitutional rights occurred in secret, inside the bowels of the IRS,"" Camp said. ""I think it\'s important that the public has an understanding of what went on, and I think if I sent a secret letter to the Department of Justice, I think that would be doing a disservice to the Americans whose constitutional rights are on the line."" \n \n Lerner first publicly disclosed the issue at a lawyers\' conference in May 2013. At the time, she apologized on behalf of the IRS. \n \n Soon afterward, President Barack Obama forced the acting IRS commissioner to resign, and much of the agency\'s top leadership has been replaced. \n \n Lerner has emerged as a central figure in investigations by congressional committees. The House Oversight Committee has scheduled a vote for Thursday on whether to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions at two congressional hearings. \n \n At both hearings, Lerner invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Lerner had effectively waived her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions by providing an opening statement at a hearing last year. \n \n Taylor and Democrats on the oversight committee disagree. \n \n Lerner is an attorney who joined the IRS in 2001.

The original inspector general report found that the targeting was inappropriate but found no evidence of partisan motivations. \n \n Republicans want her charged for improperly influencing the IRS to take action against conservative organizations; disclosing confidential taxpayer info, a felony; and impeding an investigation. \n \n Democrats cried foul play, accusing Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) of releasing private taxpayer information, and said its protests have nothing to do with holding Lerner accountable. \n \n “This executive session isn’t about any of us condoning the mismanagement at the IRS tax-exempt division,” top panel Democrat Sander Levin (D-Mich.) said after the public was dismissed from the hearing, according to a release. “It now seems clear that Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee have decided that they do not want to be left behind in the Republican campaign to declare this a scandal and keep it going until November.” \n \n (PHOTOS: 8 key players in IRS scandal story) \n \n Lerner’s lawyer William Taylor III said he had not heard from Ways and Means on the issue, and maintained his client’s innocence. \n \n “Ms. Lerner has done nothing wrong,” Taylor, a partner of Zuckerman Spaeder LLP said in a statement. “She did not violate any law or regulation. She did not mislead Congress. She did not interfere with the rights of any organization to a tax exemption. Those are the facts.” \n \n Camp defended the release. \n \n “We have a right and obligation to protect the American people and to oversee the IRS and to hold them to account for their actions,” he said. “This was a career employee at the IRS so we have to make sure the signal goes out that this can’t happen again.” \n \n The Justice Department said it will review the letter and noted it is already probing the matter. \n \n “It remains a high priority of the Department,” Justice spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. \n \n The actions come a day before the House Oversight Committee will vote to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions on the controversy. \n \n Advocates for reform of campaign finance rules say the scandal obscures an important policy debate about whether such politically active groups deserve tax-exempt status in the first place. \n \n Crossroads spent $176 million during the 2012 election cycle — 99 percent of the time to back Republicans and bash Obama and Democrats. Its nonprofit arm spent about $70 million.', 'The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday accused former IRS official Lois Lerner of targeting the prominent GOP group Crossroads GPS and urged the Justice Department to take a fresh look at whether she should be prosecuted. \n \n The rare step by the tax-writing panel comes as congressional Republicans are turning up the heat on the IRS, and a day before Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and the House Oversight Committee are expected to vote to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress. \n \n In a referral to Attorney General Eric Holder, Republicans make the case that Lerner took an “aggressive and improper” interest in Crossroads GPS, the group co-founded by Karl Rove that spent tens of millions of dollars in the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. \n \n The committee voted to send that referral to Holder after a session conducted mainly behind closed doors and on a 23-14, party-line vote. \n \n Lerner, who headed an IRS division overseeing exempt organizations, pushed to deny Crossroads GPS’s application for tax-exempt status and to audit the group, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) says in his letter to Holder. \n \n Lerner showed no such interest in liberal groups, the letter adds, despite concerns by campaign finance reform groups. Ways and Means also alleges that Lerner misled federal investigators about when she first became aware of the IRS’s improper scrutiny of Tea Party groups, and that she recklessly handled confidential taxpayer information. \n \n [READ THE LETTER.] \n \n Camp told reporters after Wednesday’s vote that the committee and Congress needed to stand up to an immensely powerful agency that “can strike the fear of God” into average taxpayers. \n \n “We have to make sure that the signal goes out that this can’t happen again,” Camp told reporters. “If we don’t stand up for people’s constitutional rights on behalf of the American people, who else will?” \n \n The Ways and Means vote was the latest wrinkle in the controversy, now 11 months old, that erupted when Lerner apologized in May 2013 for the IRS’s treatment of Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status. The referral could also broaden the congressional investigations, which have largely focused on more grassroots organizations. \n \n Lerner, who has since retired from the IRS, is expected to face another legal headache on Thursday, when Issa begins contempt proceedings. House GOP leaders who said Wednesday that they supported the Ways and Means referral are also on record backing contempt charges. \n \n Issa has said that Lerner, who has twice refused to answer questions in front of the Oversight panel, is the most important figure in his IRS investigation. \n \n Ways and Means Democrats accused Camp and their GOP colleagues of taking a page out of Issa’s playbook and playing politics by releasing taxpayer information. \n \n Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the panel’s top Democrat, said Camp was undermining the panel by making it into “an arm of any campaign committee.” Democrats later said Republicans merely wanted to “promote and protect” GOP moneymen like Rove. \n \n “The way it should have been handled was to simply forward any documentation over there and indicate the full cooperation of the committee,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas). \n \n Lerner’s attorney, Bill Taylor of Zuckerman Spaeder, called the timing of Wednesday’s vote “odd,” and said he had not heard from the Ways and Means Committee about its referral. \n \n “The committee’s referral affects nothing. The Department of Justice is already investigating the IRS. This is just another attempt by Republicans to vilify Ms. Lerner for political gain,” Taylor said in a statement to reporters. \n \n But Steven Law, Crossroads GPS’s chief executive, said the Ways and Means referral “confirms that there was an organized high-level effort within the IRS to subvert the agency’s own standards and procedures in order to harass law-abiding conservative advocacy groups like Crossroads GPS.” \n \n Law said in a separate statement that the group was still waiting for a final decision from the IRS on its application, which it first asked for in 2010. \n \n The group can continue to operate as tax-exempt until that IRS ruling. Under the current IRS rules, 501(c)(4) groups need to make promoting social welfare their primary purpose. The law says those groups should be exclusively concentrating on social welfare, a difference campaign finance reform organizations believe has been part of the problem. \n \n “It is now apparent that Ms. Lerner was directly and improperly involved in targeting our application, which may explain why we are still awaiting final action on our 501(c)(4) certification,” Law said. \n \n Camp also defended his decision to bring the charges against Lerner public. “If I sent a secret letter to the Department of Justice, I think that would be doing a disservice to the Americans whose constitutional rights are on the line,” he said. \n \n In the documents Ways and Means released Wednesday, Lerner also discusses going after a job at Organizing for Action, the offshoot of Obama’s campaign operation. \n \n “Oh — maybe I can get the DC office job!” she told colleagues in an email, though it’s unclear whether she was joking. \n \n The Ways and Means referral also accuses Lerner of targeting conservative groups outside of Crossroads. In January 2013, Lerner circulated a news article on five groups whose status she wanted to discuss. Three of those groups were eventually audited. \n \n Republicans also suggest Lerner tried to influence the appeals process for exempt organizations whose application was denied, an area outside her jurisdiction. \n \n Plus, GOP lawmakers say that Lerner gave Treasury’s inspector general for tax administration a “half-truth” by not revealing she knew that Tea Party cases were being flagged as far back as 2010. \n \n In all, Ways and Means says the laws that Lerner might have violated are punishable by up to 11 years in prison. But the final decision on whether to prosecute lies with Holder, who has also been held in contempt by House Republicans and has a generally toxic relationship with GOP lawmakers. \n \n Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman, would only say Wednesday that “there is already an active, ongoing investigation into the IRS’s handling of applications by tax-exempt organizations.” \n \n “It remains a high priority of the department,” she added. \n \n — Updated at 8:37 p.m.']",3,"– Last year's IRS scandal is back in the headlines. The House Ways and Means panel today formally asked the Justice Department for a criminal investigation into retired IRS official Lois Lerner, reports the Hill. Republicans on the committee pushed the vote through, alleging that emails show Lerner sought to deny tax-exempt status to conservative groups, particularly Crossroads GPS, while letting liberal ones slide. Democrats, meanwhile, accused the panel of political theatrics ahead of the midterms, given that the Justice Department already is conducting an investigation into the matter, reports AP. Some dueling quotes: Republican Dave Camp: ""We think there's reason to believe that laws were broken, that constitutional rights were violated,"" said the committee's chairman. ""We have to make sure that the signal goes out that this can't happen again."" Democrat Sander Levin: ""Making this committee an arm of any campaign committee does a deep disservice to the proud traditions and legacy of this committee.

"['Abstract and Introduction \n \n Abstract \n \n In 1994 the National Football League (NFL) initiated a comprehensive clinical and biomechanical research study of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), a study that is ongoing. Data on mild TBIs sustained between 1996 and 2001 were collected and submitted by NFL team physicians and athletic trainers, and these data were analyzed by the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury. At the same time, analysis of game videos was performed for on-field mild TBIs to quantify the biomechanics involved and to develop means to improve the understanding of these injuries so that manufacturers could systematically improve and update their head protective equipment. The findings and analysis of the Committee have been presented in a series of articles in Neurosurgery. \n \n Introduction \n \n In 1992 Al Toon, who was a wide receiver for the New York Jets, was the first NFL player known to have retired because of postconcussion syndrome.[2] The year after Mr. Toon\'s retirement, another player, Merrill Hoge of the Chicago Bears, retired because of the same problem. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, team physicians, and many others raised questions: was this a new problem or a misdiagnosed or unrecognized one? Was this a statistical anomaly or the beginning of an epidemic? \n \n It was decided that a rigorous, scientific approach was necessary to gather the data to answer these questions for this high-profile professional sports league. In 1994, Commissioner Tagliabue approved the creation of the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.[12] The Committee was composed of experts inside and outside the NFL. It was decided by the Committee that protection against in jury as well as collection and analysis of injury data would be critical to the success of their mission. For the study, a reportable mild TBI was defined as a traumatically induced alteration in brain function manifested by an alteration of awareness and consciousness, including but not limited to an LOC, a ""ding,"" a sensation of being dazed or stunned, a sensation of ""wooziness"" or ""fogginess,"" a seizure or amnesic period, and by symptoms commonly associated with postconcussion syndrome, including persistent headaches, vertigo, lightheadedness, loss of balance, unsteadiness, syncope, near-syncope, cognitive dysfunction, memory disturbances, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision, diplopia, visual loss, personality change, drowsiness, lethargy, fatigue, and inability to perform usual daily activities.[10] The research summarized here was developed, supervised, and completed in response to the stated goals of the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.', 'Penalty run-ups are just getting ridiculous ... \n \n Deliberate, yes? We think so. Look at the replay from side on. Look at the cheeky glimpse he gives the referee. Look at the way he\'s not clutching his face in agony and/or shame. \n \n Rather incredibly, this wasn\'t even a friendly. This was in a penalty shootout, following the 3rd/4th place playoff of the AFC Challenge Cup, a tournament held by the Asian Football Confederation for ""emerging nations"". Sadly for our penalty taker, Afghanistan went on to lose the shootout 8-7. Congrats to the Maldives. \n \n Now, who\'s going to try this in Brazil?', ""INTRODUCTION: \n \n This study aimed to use video analysis techniques to determine the velocity, impact force, angle of impact, and impulse to fracture involved in a video-recorded bicycle accident resulting in facial fractures. Computed tomographic images of the resulting facial injury are presented for correlation with data and calculations. To our knowledge, such an analysis of an actual recorded trauma has not been reported in the literature. \n \n MATERIALS AND METHODS: \n \n A video recording of the accident was split into frames and analyzed using an image editing program. Measurements of velocity and angle of impact were obtained from this analysis, and the force of impact and impulse were calculated using the inverse dynamic method with connected rigid body segments. These results were then correlated with the actual fracture pattern found on computed tomographic imaging of the subject's face. \n \n RESULTS: \n \n There was an impact velocity of 6.25 m/s, impact angles of 14 and 6.3 degrees of neck extension and axial rotation, respectively, an impact force of 1910.4 N, and an impulse to fracture of 47.8 Ns. These physical parameters resulted in clinically significant bilateral mid-facial Le Fort II and III pattern fractures. \n \n DISCUSSION: \n \n These data confer further understanding of the biomechanics of bicycle-related accidents by correlating an actual clinical outcome with the kinematic and dynamic parameters involved in the accident itself and yielding a concrete evidence of the velocity, force, and impulse necessary to cause clinically significant facial trauma. These findings can aid in the design of protective equipment for bicycle riders to help avoid this type of injury.""]",3,"– Kids have a word for it when you land face-first: ""fail."" As an Internet meme, it's called faceplanting. But what really happens when people use their face for brakes? At BoingBoing, Maggie Koerth-Baker looks at the physical results—which aren't pretty—and takes a glimpse at the related field of injury biomechanics. She starts with a paper by a mechanical engineer about a classic faceplant: young man tries to ride bike along a board from shoreline to dock, misses board, lands face-first. (See the video here.) He endured Le Fort II and III fractures, his face cracking in a triangle shape starting at the top of the nose and going down both sides to the upper jaw. Sadly, other researchers say this particular video won't advance the field because the frame-rate is poor; real experiments analyze the 10-20 milliseconds in which injuries occur. So Koerth-Baker delves deeper into injury biomechanics, starting with John Stapp, an Air Force flight surgeon who endured a sudden stop in a rocket sled at 46.2 g's of force in 1954. He broke nearly all the capillaries in his eyes, Ejection Site reports, but his work helped the Air Force design pilot ejector-seats. More recently, studies on NFL concussions have shown that hits from the side or back cause more concussions than hits on the crown of the helmet. Which leaves faceplanters where, exactly? Well, getting seriously injured as we laugh and learn. At least this one, at SBNation, faceplanted on purpose in an effort to help his team. (Click to check out some less painful memes.)"

It took defense attorney Jack McMahon a couple of hours to knock a big hole in a critical part of their argument. \n \n On the very first day he began to present his defense, McMahon was able to convince the judge to drop three first-degree murder charges against Gosnell. \n \n He argued, fervently, that ""there is not one piece...of objective, scientific evidence that anyone was born alive"" at Gosnell\'s clinic. \n \n Prosecutors have argued all along that the babies were viable and that Gosnell and his staff cut them in the back of the neck to kill them. \n \n Before announcing his decision, Judge Jeffery Minehart went into chambers for about 30 minutes. Before he came out, his court clerk cautioned the two dozen or so journalists, bloggers and observers in the courtroom not to overreact when the ruling was read. \n \n Minehart granted the acquittals and broke for lunch. \n \n Journalists raced out of the room to get word to their news outlets, which ran the gamut from national media like CNN, Fox News and The New York Times, to bloggers working for primarily conservative organizations. \n \n During her opening arguments on March 18, lead prosecutor Joanne Pescatore told jurors that for Gosnell, his abortion practice was all about the money. ""He had high volume and maximum profit,"" she said. \n \n ""This is not a case about abortion; this is a case about murder."" \n \n Pescatore put 36 witnesses on the stand, including former workers who testified that they saw babies breath, watched limbs move and listened to cries and whines. \n \n In January of 2011, Gosnell was charged with eight counts of murder. Seven first-degree murder charges were for accusations that he killed seven newborns. The third-degree murder charge is for the 2009 death of Karnamaya Mongar. Prosecutors say the 41-year-old Bhutanese refugee received lethal doses of sedatives and painkillers at the clinic while awaiting an abortion. \n \n Gosnell, 72, still faces five remaining murder charges and the possibility of the death penalty if convicted of any of the first-degree cases. \n \n He is also charged with violating Pennsylvania abortion law by performing abortions after 24 weeks, operating a corrupt organization and other crimes. \n \n Former staffer Eileen O\'Neill is also on trial.

"['WARSAW — President Andrzej Duda said on Tuesday that he would sign into law a bill making it illegal to accuse “the Polish nation” of complicity in the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities, a measure that has roiled relations with Israel and the United States, and spurred claims that the nationalist government is trying to whitewash one of the bloodiest chapters in Poland’s history. \n \n Opponents have predicted that the law — which prohibits, among other things, the phrase “Polish death camp” — would stifle free speech and put questions of historical accuracy into the hands of judges and prosecutors who may be more motivated by politics than scholarship. Despite weeks of ferocious criticism from other nations and from independent scholars, Mr. Duda’s right-wing Law and Justice Party pressed ahead with the bill. \n \n Mr. Duda said in a speech broadcast on Polish television and radio that he would sign the measure, while asking the Constitutional Court to determine whether the law violated free-speech protections and to make clear specifically what kinds of speech could be prosecuted. He said that the government wanted to be sure that survivors of war crimes felt free to tell their stories without fear. \n \n But a judicial review is unlikely to placate those who have accused the Law and Justice Party of dangerous revisionism. It is unclear when the high court, which is controlled by judges appointed by Mr. Duda’s party, might act; the law would remain in effect at least until then.', 'Columnist \n \n The Streisand effect is one of the curious byproducts of the Internet age. Named for the singer — who tried to suppress a photograph of her Malibu mansion, only to have the picture seen far more widely as a result — it occurs when an attempt to hide, remove or censor something from public view backfires badly. \n \n The Streisand effect is now in full swing in Poland, where a simultaneously incompetent and malevolent government has passed a law — rapidly, in the middle of the night — intended among other things to criminalize the term ""Polish death camps"" and other expressions implying that the Polish nation was responsible for Auschwitz and other camps built by German Nazis. The national dislike of this term goes back many years and is shared widely by all political groups, for understandable reasons. Millions of Polish citizens, including many who were not Jewish, died in these camps, among them university professors and Catholic priests, both groups deliberately targeted for extinction. Unlike in France, Belgium, Italy and most other European countries, there was no fascist, pro-German or collaborationist government in Poland during the war, and no Polish SS formation. The Nazi occupiers intended to destroy Poland as a nation, to Germanize a large chunk of the country and to turn the rest of it into a German agricultural colony. \n \n Nevertheless there were individual Poles who did terrible things to Jews during the war and afterward, just as there were individual Poles who did heroic things. The debate about how much Poland, as a nation, bears responsibility for these individual crimes has gone on for a long time and has had depressing as well as uplifting aspects. At times the conversation has been ill-tempered. But for a quarter century, dedicated Polish historians, diplomats, politicians and curators have also tried to reconcile different memories and heal wounds; one of the results was Poland\'s superb museum of Jewish history, jointly built by the international Jewish community and the Polish state. Another result was the hitherto excellent Polish-Israeli relationship, which has had big cultural as well as political benefits. Every summer, for example, a Jewish festival in Warsaw (there are others in other cities too) brings Israeli pop singers to a square near my apartment, and the concerts are always packed. \n \n The imposition, now, of a three-year prison penalty for anyone who participates in the conversation about the past in ways that irritate the current ruling party is simply ludicrous, even laughable. Will the long arm of the Polish state reach out to academic conferences in Tokyo or Buenos Aires if someone uses an incorrect phrase? Will people be punished for politically incorrect memoirs? In a pompous speech the Polish prime minister gave supporting the law, an automatic translation service made it appear as if he himself said that ""camps where millions of Jews were murdered were Polish."" Should he go to prison, too? Should Google Translate? The very stupidity and unenforceability of this law is what has brought on the Streisand effect: Beginning in Israel but moving quickly across all forms of social media around the world, the use of the phrase ""Polish death camps"" has suddenly spiked and has now been used many more times than ever before in history. \n \n To Poland\'s anti-pluralist ruling party that doesn\'t matter, because the real purpose of the law was never Poland\'s international image. In a sharp break with all previous democratic governments of the left, right and center, going back to 1989, this government does not care how isolated or ridiculous the country becomes. On the contrary, foreign criticism offers another chance to solidify the support of ""patriots"" who oppose the ""slander"" of the country, against ""traitors"" who do not. One pro-government journalist gave the game away when he declared that the criticism of the law in Israel was an element in an international conspiracy against the Polish government. On cue, Polish social media has been saturated with the howls of anti-Semites defending their country against this terrible attack. \n \n I have no doubt that the Israeli government is also using this nasty little controversy for its own purposes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been disturbed by the Hungarian government\'s long-standing and well-funded campaign — on billboards, in the noisy state and pro-government media — against billionaire George Soros, with its clear anti-Semitic overtones, since he dislikes Soros\'s philanthropic support for liberal causes. His decision to make an issue of this absurd Polish law instead no doubt gives him a chance to solidify his domestic support as well. Taking a stand on the past is so much easier than dealing with the complex present. \n \n The irony is that none of the protagonists of this story can actually remember World War II, or the terror that it brought to the Jews and to Poland. But that is part of the explanation: As genuine memories of the horror recede, cartoon versions of history, easily manipulated, have come to replace them. This illiterate ""debate"" is one of the more sordid results. \n \n Read more from Anne Applebaum\'s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.', 'Polish President Andrzej Duda ratified a law making it illegal to blame his country for any part in the German Nazis’ systematic murder of millions of Jews during World War II, bowing to pressure from his ruling allies and amid rallies by far-right protesters. \n \n Despite mounting international criticism, ruling Law & Justice party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski urged Duda to sign the legislation. The president complied Tuesday, a day after dozens of activists chanted anti-Semitic slogans at a rally in front of his presidential palace in central Warsaw, with one banner reading: “Take off your yarmulke and sign the bill.” \n \n Andrzej Duda on Feb. 6. Photographer: Janek Skarzynski/AFP via Getty Images \n \n Both Israel and the U.S. have called on Poland to halt the so-called Holocaust bill, which they say curbs free speech and may be an attempt to rewrite history. Duda said that while he approved the legislation, he’s also sending it to be vetted by the Constitutional Tribunal, a court that may ask lawmakers to change part or all of the legislation. \n \n “This guarantees Polish interests, such as our dignity and the historical truth -- that we will be fairly evaluated in the world,” Duda told reporters in Warsaw, taking no questions. “On the other hand, my decision takes into account the sensitivity of people for whom the historical truth and the truth about the Holocaust is extremely important.” \n \n ‘Rewritten Narrative’ \n \n Israel’s Foreign Ministry said that it hopes the tribunal’s pending review will allow it to work on amendments with Polish authorities. \n \n The controversy represents the latest conflict for the Law & Justice party, which over two years in power has battled its partners in the European Union over allegations that it’s backtracking on democratic values. Once seen as a model of transformation from communism, Poland is “squandering the great gains” it has achieved since 1989, according to Judy Dempsey, a Berlin-based fellow at Carnegie Europe, a think-tank. \n \n Poland’s main political objective since embracing democracy was to anchor itself in the EU and NATO, helped by “rapprochement and reconciliation” with Germany, Ukraine and Israel, Dempsey wrote on Tuesday. “But now, because of this legislation, the Polish narrative is being rewritten in a way that it is becoming seeped in patriotism, victimhood, and revenge.” \n \n ‘A Single Jew’ \n \n Poles say they’re unfairly held complicit in German Nazi war crimes during a period when their country was occupied and an estimated 2.7 million non-Jewish civilians were killed, including a large number of resistance fighters. Only 380,000 of Poland’s 3 million Jews -- Europe’s largest pre-war Jewish community -- survived the Holocaust, according to Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. \n \n While some Polish civilians participated in the murder of Jews or turned them over to Nazis to avoid being executed for hiding them, others resisted. Yad Vashem has commemorated 6,700 Poles for rescuing Jews, the largest number of “Righteous Gentiles” in any country. \n \n The law would impose fines or up to three years in jail for public claims that Poland or the Polish nation bears responsibility for crimes against humanity committed on its soil. Works of art and science are exempt. \n \n “We don’t have any intention to prosecute someone who says that somewhere a single Jew or a family were murdered,” Kaczynski told public radio on Feb. 3. “Such events took place and we never denied this.” \n \n Ukrainian Objection \n \n Last week, Israeli legislators drew up a bill defining any attempt to deny or minimize the crimes of Nazi collaborators as Holocaust denial, which carries a five-year prison sentence in the Jewish state. It would provide state backing for any Holocaust survivor or educator prosecuted under the Polish bill. \n \n Neighboring Ukraine also criticized the Polish law, which widened the government’s mandate to prosecute crimes committed by “Ukrainian nationalists and members of Ukrainian formations collaborating with the Third Reich” from 1925 to 1950. Lawmakers in Kiev passed a resolution Tuesday saying they were “deeply concerned” the law could pave the way for “the strengthening of anti-Ukrainian tendencies.” \n \n — With assistance by Konrad Krasuski, Daryna Krasnolutska, and Alisa Odenheimer']",3,"– The US and Israel pitched a fit, but it ultimately wasn't enough to fully stop Poland from moving ahead with its controversial Holocaust law. Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday announced he would sign a bill that prohibits speech that states or suggests his nation was complicit in Nazi Germany's crimes. In a concession to critics, though, Duda will have the Constitutional Tribunal examine the law; Bloomberg reports the court has the power to force lawmakers to alter the law's language in whole or part. The New York Times quotes Duda as saying he's adding that step because the ""very painful, delicate issue"" needs to be handled thoughtfully, though the Times sees the move as doing little to assuage those who say it could curtail free speech and whitewash the role some Poles played in the killing of Jews during World War II. Duda said that should the court clear the law, he'd like to see it specify exactly what type of speech is subject to prosecution. As it stands now, using the phrase ""Polish death camp"" to refer to Auschwitz and other Nazi-constructed concentration camps within the country can result in a prison term; claiming the Polish nation ""is responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes"" is punishable by up to three years. In a Washington Post column, Anne Applebaum writes of the law's ""ludicrous"" potential: ""Will the long arm of the Polish state reach out to academic conferences in Tokyo or Buenos Aires if someone uses an incorrect phrase? ... In a pompous speech the Polish prime minister gave supporting the law, an automatic translation service made it appear as if he himself said that 'camps where millions of Jews were murdered were Polish.'

"['Michael Dunn, who shot and killed Jordan Davis and opened fire on three of Davis\' friends, made phone calls from jail in which he compared himself to a rape victim, made racially charged comments, and insisted that he was ""the one who was victimized"" in the deadly shooting. \n \n According to a transcript of the released audio, Dunn told fiancée Rhonda Roue that he felt ""attacked"" when he fired 10 shots at a car of black teenagers, unarmed young people whom Dunn, a middle-aged white man, continued to shoot at even as they fled his violent assault: \n \n I was the one that was being preyed upon and I fought back. It’s not quite the same but it made me think of like the old TV shows and movies where like how the police used to think when a chick got raped going, “Oh, it’s her fault because of the way she dressed.” I’m like, “So it’s my fault (laughing) because I asked them to turn their music down. I got attacked and I fought back because I didn’t want to be a victim and now I’m in trouble. I refused to be a victim and now I’m incarcerated.” \n \n “I’m the f*** victim here,” he said during one of the phone calls. “I was the one who was victimized … I’m the victor, but I was the victim too.” \n \n Dunn was held in a cell by himself while in jail, which he said in one of these phone calls was ""better than being in a room with them animals."" As Nicole Flatlow at ThinkProgress notes, Dunn later complained that while in jail he was ""in a room with three black guys."" \n \n Dunn has made no secret of his racist views. In previously released letters Dunn wrote while in jail, he said, “This jail is full of blacks and they all act like thugs ... This may sound a bit radical, but if more people would arm themselves and kill these fucking idiots when they’re threatening you, eventually they may take the hint and change their behavior.” \n \n Dunn was found guilty this week on three charges of attempted murder for the shooting, but evaded accountability for shooting and killing Davis. \n \n He will face a retrial for the murder charge.', 'The man who shot and killed a teenager in Florida after an argument over loud music told his fiancee in a telephone call a month after his arrest that he was both the victim and the victor in the deadly encounter. \n \n ""You know I was thinking about that today, I was like I\'m the f*** victim here, I was the one who was victimized,"" Michael Dunn said from jail in December 2012, a month after the shooting. ""I mean I don\'t know how else to cut it, like they attacked me, I’m the victim. I\'m the victor, but I was the victim too."" \n \n \n \n Dunn, a 47-year-old computer programmer, was convicted on Saturday of attempted murder for shooting into a car full of teenagers after the argument but the jury deadlocked on the most serious charge of first-degree murder. A mistrial was declared on the murder charge. \n \n Dunn killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis in the parking lot of a Jacksonville gas station on the evening of Nov. 23, 2012. Dunn fired 10 shots at the red Dodge Durango that Davis and three other teens were riding in, hitting Davis three times. He died at the scene. \n \n In the conversation with his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, he also complained about being in a room by himself, but added: ""But I guess it would be better than being in a room with them animals."" \n \n A short while later, he said, ""I was in a room with three black guys."" \n \n ""Two were kids and one was an old man,"" he continued. ""And they asked what I was in for and I told them.

All took place in December 2012 while he was in jail and were with Rouer or his parents, Phillip and Sandra Dunn. Also released was a letter that he wrote describing the shooting. \n \n At first the teenagers turned down the music in their car, as he had asked, but then he wrote that he could hear one of the passengers in the back seat shouting that he should kill Dunn. \n \n ""He bends forward and picked something up with both hands,"" Dunn wrote. ""As he\'s doing this, he says \'yeah-I\'m going to f****** kill you!"" and now I can tell what he\'s picked up, as he just laid a gun barrel against the window sill. I can see about four inches of the barrel sticking up and it looks thick enough to be a 12 gauge maybe a 20 gauge shotgun."" \n \n At first he was paralyzed by fear by the sight of the shotgun, he wrote. \n \n ""Something happened inside of me when he advanced towards me and my paralysis left me,"" he wrote. ""Between fear, adrenaline and muscle-memory, I grabbed my pistol from the glove box. As I was doing so, I shouted, ""You\'re not going to kill me you son of a b****!"" \n \n Dunn, who is white, testified that he fired in self-defense. \n \n \n \n But no weapon was found in the SUV and Davis\' friends said they did not hear him threaten Dunn. The state\'s medical examiner testified that the trajectory of Dunn\'s bullets into Davis\' body showed that Davis was sitting down when he was shot. \n \n Authorities said that Dunn became enraged about the music and the argument. One person walking out of the store said he heard Dunn say, ""You are not going to talk to me like that."" \n \n The state attorney, Angela Corey, has said her office will seek a retrial of Dunn on the first-degree murder charge. \n \n Dunn\'s defense attorney, Cory Strolla, has said he plans to appeal. \n \n In another telephone call, Dunn\'s father told him of the shooting, ""This thing is viral. It\'s all over the place. It\'s like that, you know, because he was a black kid."" \n \n A short while later, Phillip Dunn said again, ""It\'s gone viral."" \n \n ""In a good way or a bad way?"" Michael Dunn asked. \n \n ""A bad way, bad way,"" his father responded. \n \n And his father warns him not to be seen smiling. \n \n ""You can cry for a half hour, crack one smile and they\'ll have you as a heartless son of a b**** that\'s smiling about it,"" he said.', 'Prosecutors released audio Monday of several jailhouse calls placed by Michael Dunn -- the man at the center of another controversial Florida trial -- shedding new light on his mindset in the initial days after he fatally shot 17-year-old Jordan Davis over a confrontation over loud music. \n \n ""I\'m the [expletive deleted] victim here. I was the one who was victimized,"" says Dunn, 47, in one of the calls in which he appeared to chuckle while speaking about his predicament. ""I\'m the victor but I was the victim too."" \n \n In a separate call with his fiancé Rhonda Rouer, Dunn makes the connection between his situation and scenarios where police officers doubt rape victims. \n \n ""I was the one that was being preyed upon and I fought back.

I refused to be a victim and now I\'m incarcerated."" \n \n Prosecutors accused Dunn of killing Davis in a convenience store parking lot after they got into an argument over loud music. Jurors found Dunn guilty on four of five charges for shooting at Davis\' friends, who were also in the car, as well as firing a gun into a car in the 2012 incident. However, jurors could not agree on the first-degree murder charge for shooting Davis, prompting a mistrial on that count. \n \n The recordings mirror statements Dunn made in trial in which he stated that he believed his life was in danger, thus leaving him little choice but to shoot. The case has once again rekindled anger in some circles about self-defense laws, in particular ""stand your ground,"" despite it never being invoked during the trial. \n \n Dunn testified that after he asked Davis to turn down the music blaring from the teen\'s car, a confrontation ensued and that Davis approached the middle-aged software developer. Dunn said he believed Davis had a weapon, leaving him little choice but to defend himself. However, a gun was never recovered at the scene. \n \n In one of the nine calls released today, Dunn reads a letter that he planned on sending to the judge presiding over his case in an effort to make bail. Repeatedly both he and his fiancé say that the legal system is stacked against them, however Dunn says the law is on his side. \n \n ""I\'m super confident if they take this to trial it will be a short deliberation,"" said Dunn. \n \n Dunn who placed the calls while in isolation also made repeated efforts to distance himself from fellow inmates, ""Being in a room by myself really sucks, but better than being in a room with them animals."" \n \n He will spend at least 60 years behind bars for the attempted murder charges. Prosecutors have indicated that they plan to retry Dunn on the first-degree murder charge.']",3,"– Michael Dunn, the man who is going to jail over killing an apparently unarmed teen in an argument over loud music, appears like he's aiming to be even less popular than George Zimmerman.

I was the one who was victimized. I’m the victor but I was the victim too."" Dunn made similar statements during the trial, indicating he feared for his life, ABC News reports.

Elijah Silvera was given a grilled cheese sandwich at a Harlem daycare on Nov. 3 ""despite them knowing and having documented that he has a severe allergy to dairy,"" family members write on a GoFundMe page. He went into anaphylactic shock and doctors were unable to save him. The New York Times reports that a cousin says that instead of calling an ambulance, the school called the boy's mother, who took him to the hospital. The FDNY has confirmed that no ambulances were called to the Seventh Avenue Center for Family Services that day. Christopher Miller, a spokesman for the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the facility has been closed and they are continuing to ""aggressively investigate what happened and whether the facility could have done something differently to prevent this tragedy,"" ABC reports. He says there was a safety plan in place, as required by law, but did not comment on whether the daycare had an EpiPen that could have treated Elijah. On the GoFundMe page, relatives say the family is ""only beginning the long and painful process of adjusting to a world that does not include Elijah in it."" They say they are raising funds for expenses including a second autopsy to determine whether the school or the hospital failed to follow protocols."
"['Research suggests that the ratio of the lengths of the index finger and the ring finger in males may be predictive of a variety of disorders related to disturbed hormonal balance. When the index finger is shorter than the ring finger, this results in a small 2D:4D ratio, pointing to a high exposure to testosterone in the uterus. \n \n In a new study of 103 male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 matched healthy male individuals, investigators found that the 2D:4D ratio may be an effective predictor of schizophrenia--there were significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio of the lengths of the second digit to the fourth digit, as well as its asymmetry, in both hands. \n \n ""Asymmetry index showed moderate discriminatory power and, therefore asymmetry index has a potential utility as a diagnostic test in determining the presence of schizophrenia,"" said Dr. Taner Oznur, co-author of the Clinical Anatomy study. \n \n ###', 'The production of androgens (mostly testosterone) during the early fetal stage is essential for the differentiation of the male brain. Some authors have suggested a relationship between androgen exposure during the prenatal period and schizophrenia. These two separate relationships suggest that digit length ratios are associated with schizophrenia in males. The study was performed in a university hospital between October 2012 and May 2013. One hundred and three male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM‐IV using SCID‐I, and 100 matched healthy males, were admitted to the study. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to assess schizophrenia symptoms. The second digit (2D) and fourth digit (4D) asymmetry index (AI), and the right‐ and left‐hand 2D:4D ratios were calculated. All parametric data in the groups were compared using an independent t‐test. The predictive power of the AI was estimated by receiver operating characteristics analysis. The 2D:4D AI was statistically significantly lower in the patient group than the healthy control comparison group. There were significant differences between the schizophrenia and the control groups in respect of left 2D:4D and right 2D:4D. There was no correlation between AI, left, or right 2D:4D, BPRS, or SAPS in the schizophrenia group. However, there was a negative correlation between left 2nd digit (L2D):4D and the SANS score. Our findings support the view that the 2D:4D AI can be used as a moderate indicator of schizophrenia. Even more simply, the right or left 2D:4D can be used as an indicator. L2D:4D could indicate the severity of negative symptoms. Clin. Anat. 28:551–556, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",2,"– The length of a man's index and ring fingers have recently been linked from everything to promiscuity and how nice he is to women. The idea is that finger lengths change depending on exposure to testosterone in utero, and it's known as the ""2D:4D"" ratio. A lower ratio—where the second digit is shorter than the fourth—indicates ""greater androgen exposure."" In the journal Clinical Anatomy, researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia; they take that one step further, hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males. Then they set out to test that hypothesis: In their small study, researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 Turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls. They found ""significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands,"" the researchers report in a press release. The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: The right-hand 2D:4D ratio was ""significantly higher"" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was ""significantly lower""—suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone ""affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain,"" per the study. As for those ratios, the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients. (A recent study found that schizophrenia isn't actually one disease.)"

The medical advancement is being touted as the first of its kind in the world. It happened last June when doctors in London, Ont., used a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine (fMRI) to analyze brain activity patterns in Scott Routley. Photograph by: Miguel Alvarez , AFP/Getty Images \n \n TORONTO - For more than a decade, Scott Routley has been living in a vegetative state. \n \n He can\'t talk. He can\'t move. And although his eyes are open, no one is sure whether he can see. \n \n But now, for the first time, doctors caring for the 39-year-old London, Ont., man say they know he\'s not in pain. \n \n And they learned it from Routley himself, by analyzing his brain waves when they asked him. \n \n ""This was a landmark moment for us because for the first time, a patient can actually tell us information, important information about how they\'re feeling and their current situation,"" said lead researcher Dr. Adrian Owen on Tuesday. \n \n The medical breakthrough, believed to be the only time a severely brain injured patient has been able to relay clinically relevant information to their doctors, is being touted as a new way to possibly improve their quality of care. \n \n Owen, who is the head of the Brain and Mind Institute at the University of Western Ontario, says research published online last year in The Lancet shows that one in five of these patients are conscious, but essentially trapped in their bodies because they\'re unable to communicate verbally or physically. \n \n His team has been working for the past year trying to determine whether Routley, who became vegetative following a car crash 12 years ago, had any ""residual brain activity"" and how much he was able to understand them. \n \n Last June, the doctors employed a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine (fMRI) to see if they would be able to analyze his brain patterns. \n \n They told Routley that they wanted him to imagine that he was playing tennis if he wasn\'t in pain or imagine that he was walking around his house if he was in pain. \n \n The thought process involved in playing a complex sport like tennis triggers the part of the brain that controls motor skills, while thinking about walking around your house triggers visual associations — contained in a separate area of the brain. \n \n With the fMRI, doctors were able to measure the activity in Routley\'s brain and conclude he was trying to tell them he was free of pain. \n \n Owen says for now, this technology is effective in determining responses to simple yes or no questions but may eventually pave the way for vegetative patients to communicate on a regular basis using a computer-assisted interface. \n \n ""We can use this type of technology to ask them what sort of entertainment they want to be exposed to? Do they want to watch TV or do they want to listen to music? What type of music? What time would they like to be fed... activities of daily living which are entirely under the control of these people around them, the people caring for them,"" he said. \n \n ""We can now ask the patients about these things and give them a role in the decision making that governs their life."" \n \n Neurologist Dr. Bryan Young says Routley\'s family has always been ""convinced"" that he was awake and aware in his state. \n \n He says this technology has the potential to become an instrumental tool for the medical community to assess whether a vegetative patient wants to live or die. \n \n But Young warned that it would only be helpful if there was a reliable test available to determine if the patient was psychologically sound, and able to make and convey their wishes. \n \n ""One has to establish, though, that apart from these simple responses to these simple commands, they are able to think in a deeper and more profound way about their quality of life and their wishes and goals and what they would prefer,"" he said. \n \n Routley, who is currently living at the Parkwood Hospital in London, is among several vegetative Canadian and British patients featured in a documentary airing Tuesday on the BBC.']",2,"– An intriguing medical breakthrough out of Canada—doctors say they have been able for the first time to communicate with a patient who has severe brain damage.

"['White House counselor Kellyanne Conway speaks in support of Republican congressional candidate Jay Webber at an event in Wayne, N.J., on Oct. 22, 2018. (Seth Wenig/AP) \n \n President Trump knows Matthew G. Whitaker, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Sunday, two days after the president sought to distance himself from his handpicked acting attorney general. \n \n “The president does know Matt Whitaker, has gotten to know him over the course of the last year, since he has been the chief of staff to the attorney general,” Conway said on “Fox News Sunday.” \n \n Trump last week forced Jeff Sessions to resign as attorney general and chose Whitaker, who was then Sessions’s chief of staff, to serve as his interim replacement. In the days since, Whitaker’s background and previous critical statements about the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III have come under intense scrutiny, with Democrats and some Republicans calling for him to recuse himself from oversight of the probe. \n \n Trump on Friday repeatedly claimed that he did not personally know Whitaker, telling reporters, “I don’t know Whitaker.” That contradicted Trump’s statement last month in a Fox News interview, during which the president said, “I know Matt Whitaker.” \n \n Conway said Sunday that Trump was trying to make the point Friday that in selecting Whitaker for the acting attorney general job, he wasn’t appointing “a friend there who he’s known his entire life.” \n \n She added that it wasn’t clear whether Whitaker had been briefed on the Mueller probe. \n \n “He’s been the chief of staff to a recused attorney general,” she said. \n \n Trump had been aware before appointing him that Whitaker was a skeptic of the Mueller probe, which factored into the decision to tap him over Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, two White House advisers told The Washington Post. \n \n Speaking on ABC News’s “This Week,” Conway said the president chose Whitaker because he wanted to “have a continuum” when it comes to people serving in the attorney general role. She added that the Trump administration had been “compliant” with the investigation and that she “can’t really blame” the president “if he doesn’t” meet with Mueller. \n \n Trump’s legal team in August rejected Mueller’s conditions for a sit-down interview, although Trump said Friday that he has not ruled out an interview with the special counsel. \n \n Asked about the op-ed co-written by her husband, lawyer George T. Conway III, in which he argued that Whitaker’s appointment was unconstitutional, she said: “Spouses disagree.” \n \n In an appearance on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) also defended Trump’s appointment of Whitaker, describing the acting attorney general as “legally qualified and otherwise qualified to oversee this investigation.” \n \n “I’m confident that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job without interference,” Graham said, adding: “You don’t recuse somebody because they have opinions different than the people they’re overseeing.” \n \n Frances Stead Sellers contributed to this report.', 'Kellyanne Conway appeared on Fox News Sunday this morning with more of her patented alternative facts. This time, the White House aide was discussing video the administration shared of the interaction between CNN reporter Jim Acosta and a White House press intern who tried to take a mic away from him during a combative exchange with the president, footage experts have confirmed was altered to speed up the motion of Acosta’s arm. \n \n Host Chris Wallace broached the subject of the now-infamous confrontation first: “I want to ask you about two responses by the White House. First, to tweet a video that was clearly altered to make it look like it was more of a physical confrontation that it really was… And second, to pull Acosta’s pass to get into the White House and to threaten to do that to other reporters.” \n \n “Well, Chris, first of all,” Conway responded, “What do you mean by edited, or as others are saying, ‘doctored video?’ He either put his hands on her and grabbed the mic back or he did not, and he clearly did.” \n \n “The video was altered, and there are experts who have looked at it,” Wallace said. \n \n This is where Conway went into ultimate spin mode. \n \n “By that do you mean sped up? Oh, well that’s not altered, that’s sped up,” she said. “They do it all the time in sports to see if there’s actually a first down or a touchdown, so I have to disagree with the, I think, overwrought description of this video being doctored as if we put somebody else’s arm in there.” \n \n There’s a lot to unpack here. First, let’s consult the dictionary for a definition of “altered.” To alter something means “to make different in some particular, as size, style, course, or the like; modify.” Speeding up a video sure seems to fall under that definition. \n \n Second, sports. It’s blatantly untrue that sports broadcasters speed up footage to show where the ball should be marked or a touchdown. If anything they slow the footage to see it more clearly. But, apparently, in Kellyanne’s world, where up is down, black is white and cats and dogs are besties, sports broadcasts actually speed up plays that they are trying to analyze. \n \n Third, no one is saying they “put somebody else’s arm” in the video. It’s a strawman argument, one of Conway’s favorite tactics. \n \n The exchange between Acosta and the intern, fueled by the White Houses’s mischaracterization of the interaction, has become such a cultural talking point it was parodied on Saturday Night Live, with Cecily Strong playing the determined intern trying to take the mic from Weekend Update host Colin Jost.']",2,"– Kellyanne Conway may have cleared up whether President Trump knows acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker—after Trump called Whitaker ""a great guy"" in October, made him acting AG last week, and claimed not to know him Friday, the Washington Post reports. ""The president does know Matt Whitaker, has gotten to know him over the course of the last year, since he has been the chief of staff to the attorney general,"" says Conway on Fox News Sunday. Trump was only emphasizing Friday that Whitaker isn't ""a friend there who he's known his entire life,"" Conway explains. For more around the Sunday dial, including an accusation by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: The Acosta video: ""He either put his hands on her and grabbed the mic [from] her or he did not and he clearly did,"" Conway says of the much-ballyhooed video showing CNN reporter Jim Acosta resisting the mic-grab of an administration intern, per Rolling Stone.

The court\'s decision came down on her thirty-second birthday. \n \n Her family told Amnesty that she intended to keep her infant son with her in prison if forced to serve her sentence. \n \n (Editing by Tom Heneghan)', 'Bahrain: One-year prison sentence for activist who ripped up photo of King a vindictive assault on freedom of expression \n \n Today’s appeal verdict against Bahraini activist Zainab Al-Khawaja, confirming her conviction on charges of “insulting” the King of Bahrain and reducing her three-year prison sentence to one year, is the latest example of the authorities’ total disregard for the right to freedom of expression, said Amnesty International. \n \n The verdict, confirming a conviction for ripping up a photo of the King in court in October 2014, coincides with Zainab Al- Khawaja’s 32nd birthday and leaves the mother of two facing a prison sentence of a year and at risk of immediate re-arrest \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja\'s family have told Amnesty International that if she is imprisoned she intends to keep her baby son - just under a year old- with her while she serves her sentence. \n \n “The Bahraini Court of Appeals’ decision to reject Zainab Al-Khawaja’s appeal for freedom and to incarcerate her for one year is a vindictive assault on freedom of expression and offers yet another example of the Bahraini authorities’ use of oppressive tactics to silence peaceful activists,” said James Lynch, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Amnesty International. \n \n “It is ludicrous that Zainab Al-Khawaja is facing a year in prison simply for tearing up a photo of the head of state. The Bahraini authorities must ensure her conviction and prison sentence are quashed. She should not be punished in any way for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression.” \n \n Laws that prohibit insults or the disrespect of heads of state or other public officials are contrary to international human rights law and standards. Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the Bahraini authorities to repeal articles in its Penal Code that criminalize freedom of expression. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja is the daughter of prominent activist and prisoner of conscience Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, who is currently serving a life sentence for his peaceful role in anti-government protests in 2011. \n \n In addition to facing a year in prison, she was fined 3,000 BD (nearly $8,000), a sum she may not to be able to afford. If the fine is not paid her prison term will be extended by around a year and a half. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja has been arrested and released several times since December 2011 and has previously spent almost a year and a half in prison. \n \n She is also appealing three other convictions against her, including a four-month sentence for two charges of “destroying public property” for ripping up photos of the King of Bahrain in May 2012 and a one-year sentence for “insulting a public officer” after she spoke out to defend another prisoner who was insulted and humiliated by a prison guard in June 2013. The verdicts on the appeal of those convictions will be issued on 3 December. \n \n On 17 November, she will appeal a nine-month sentence related to ""entering a restricted area"" and ""insulting a public official"", when she sought to visit her father who was on hunger strike in Jaw prison in August 2014. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja is one of several human rights or political activists in Bahrain recently imprisoned for peacefully expressing their opinion. \n \n “The Bahraini authorities’ persistent persecution of human rights activists and other government critics is a glaring example of their abject failure to deliver on promised reforms. To prove they are serious about upholding human rights, they need to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners detained in Bahrain solely for peacefully expressing their views,” said James Lynch.']",2,"– The daughter of a well-known Bahraini human rights activist was sentenced Wednesday to a year in jail for delivering the ultimate insult to her country's king: ripping up a picture of him, Reuters reports.

"['Some consular staff of the real US Embassy in Ghana would be sacked after security officials discovered and shut down a fake Embassy that has been operating for 10 years and issuing genuine US visas in the country at a cost of $6000. \n \n Genuine visas can only be issued when there is an inside job. \n \n The fake embassy also reportedly issued visas to other European countries, as well as counterfeit documents. \n \n It is not clear when the criminals were busted but the information was posted on the Department of State’s website on November 2, 2016, the news however, went viral only after ghanabusinessnews.com broke it Friday evening December 2. \n \n While US Embassy officials won’t comment because they say investigation of the matter is ongoing, ghanabusinessnews.com can say on authority that some staff of the consular section would be fired. \n \n A source familiar with Department of State processes told ghanabusinessnews.com that employees found culpable in the crime would simply be recalled and no reasons would be assigned, and Embassy staff wouldn’t even know about it. \n \n It appears that’s how diplomatic missions handle offences by staff. Ghanabusinessnews.com is familiar with a similar incident at the Embassy of a European country in Ghana. There was a visa scandal at this Embassy in 2012, and the Ambassador was quietly recalled, and no reason was assigned. Some staff didn’t even know why. \n \n A source who wasn’t authorized to speak to the media told ghanabusinessnews.com that employees at the said Embassy apparently were engaged in illegal issuance of visas, and the travellers were arrested at the country’s entry point. The travellers were caught because that country had joined a new visa system, and had changed its visas. But these travellers had the visa from the old system. \n \n In an unprecedented move in 2006, Switzerland recalled its entire diplomatic staff including the ambassador from its Karachi mission when it was discovered that there was a massive visa fraud in its Islamabad Embassy, and visas for Pakistanis were halted at that time. \n \n The fake US Embassy operating somewhere in Accra, was issuing genuine visas, the security team that closed it down said. They also found that a Ghanaian immigration lawyer working with some Turkish and other Ghanaian citizens was involved with the active connivance of Ghana law enforcement officers, who were apparently bribed to look the other way. \n \n Visa acquisition in Ghana \n \n Applying for visas in Ghana is a dreadful experience for any prospective traveller. The consular sections of almost all Embassies demand for proofs like birth certificate, bank statements, invitation letters, some with additional photocopies of hosts, and in some instances even their bank statements. \n \n After providing all these, the Embassies demand that prospective travellers submit their applications in person and in most cases go through an interview, and yet many known qualified prospective travellers with no intention of remaining in these countries are denied visas. \n \n There was a famous case of a medical professional that was invited to present a paper at a conference in Spain but was denied visa on the flimsy excuse that he didn’t satisfy the conditions for a visa, which in most cases means that the applicant is not likely to return to Ghana. \n \n This medical expert then responded by writing a copious open letter to the Spanish Embassy in Ghana. \n \n Connection men \n \n Due to the frustrating experience in acquiring a visa to travel, especially to Europe and the US, the phenomena of connection men has sprung up. While anyone familiar with visa issuance processes would disbelieve the effectiveness of these connection men to whom prospective travellers pay huge sums of money for visas, these incidents of the fake US Embassy and the example of the European country’s embassy in Ghana emphatically confirm that insiders work with these connection men to issue visas. \n \n Human trafficking \n \n This fake US Embassy that operated for 10 years, which category of travellers was it serving? Could they have issued visas to human traffickers? Because $6000 is a colossal amount that very few ordinary travellers can afford. It would therefore, not be out of place to assume that most of the clients of this criminal gang were human traffickers. \n \n The crime of human trafficking is a lucrative illegal business generating an amount of $150 billion every year for traffickers. \n \n By Emmanuel K.

(Courtesy of the State Department) \n \n For a decade, an American flag flew outside a battered pink building in Ghana’s capital city, welcoming out-of-town visitors who, once inside, found a photo of President Obama hanging on the wall. Signs confirmed to travelers — who had been bused in from the most remote parts of West Africa — that they had arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Accra. \n \n The “consular officers” working there were not Americans, but they spoke English and Dutch and issued official-looking visas and identification papers. They charged their customers $6,000. \n \n Billboards and fliers advertised the official services. \n \n But there was nothing official about them. The real U.S. Embassy in Accra is white, not pink, and it sits on a large piece of land inside security fences in one of the city’s wealthiest neighborhoods. \n \n The battered building with the flag and Obama picture was a fake — ran by Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian lawyer practicing immigration and criminal law, the State Department said in a statement. \n \n “For about a decade it operated unhindered,” the statement said. “The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored.” \n \n Officials said they shut down the fraudulent operation during the summer after an informant tipped off the assistant investigator for the Regional Security Office. The investigation in Ghana stemmed from a larger State Department initiative, Operation Spartan Vanguard, which was created by the RSO to “address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. Embassy and the region,” according to the statement. \n \n \n \n The real U.S. Embassy in Ghana. (Courtesy of the State Department) \n \n The State Department released information about the investigation Nov. 2, but the news is being widely reported only now. The story seems to have been first reported by Ghanaian media last week, and it cites the statement from one month ago on the State Department website. The information was not contained in a news release from the State Department or its Bureau of Diplomatic Security, but in a “behind the scenes” article written by diplomatic security staff. \n \n In it, officials did not say how many people, if any, may have entered the United States illegally with documentation from the fake embassy or how the crime ring got hold of what the state department called “fraudulently obtained, legitimate U.S. visas.” \n \n State Department officials in Ghana deferred questions to the media office in Washington, which did not immediately respond to a request for more information. \n \n The sham embassy, authorities said, did not allow walk-in appointments but instead recruited customers from remote parts of West Africa and even targeted people in the neighboring countries of Ivory Coast and Togo with billboards and fliers. They would shuttle customers to Accra, rent them rooms in a nearby hotel and then shuttle them to the fake embassy, which only operated on Monday, Tuesday and Friday, from 7:30 a.m. to noon. \n \n The Turkish citizens posing as “consulate officers,” officials said, issued U.S. work visas, counterfeit visas and false Ghanaian identification papers, such as bank and education records and birth certificates. \n \n \n \n Fake passports and documentation obtained in the raids. (Courtesy of the U.S. State Department) \n \n The RSO investigator, with officers from the Ghana Police Force, verified the initial informant tip and then formed an international task force that included the Ghana Detective Bureau, Ghana SWAT and Canadian Embassy officials. \n \n They exposed the shabby pink building as the crime ring’s central hub and discovered two other locations — a dress shop and an apartment building — that were satellite operators. \n \n A raid at the dress shop derailed the investigation when the “corrupt Ghanaian attorney” lied to local police, officials said, telling law enforcement they could not enter the shop because it was involved in a different court case. \n \n That court case, though, did not exist — it was a decoy meant to buy time for “corrupt officials” to find money and bail out of jail members of the crime ring, officials said. The group then moved the document-production facility — including a purported industrial sewing machine that bound the fake passports — outside Accra and exported the fraudulent documents from the dress shop to Europe and other parts of Africa. \n \n “Several suspects” were arrested during the raids, State Department officials said, but they did not specify how many. Warrants have been issued for the suspects who escaped and Ghanaian police plan to pursue them. Officials said the investigation is ongoing. \n \n Evidence collected during the raids included a laptop computer, smartphones, counterfeit-identity documents, 150 passports from 10 countries, and legitimate and counterfeit visas from the United States, the Schengen area of Europe, India and South Africa. \n \n The creation of fraudulent documents has decreased by 70 percent since Operation Spartan Vanguard commenced, officials said, but called this “only the beginning.” \n \n In Africa, many people seek visas for Western countries such as the United States, making production of fake documents at steep prices a profitable business model for crime rings, Reuters reported. \n \n Similar operations have been busted in Accra, including one in January that had been making and selling fake documents for 13 years. In that investigation, authorities found 190 passports, three printers, one camera, 75 different rubber stamps, two lamination machines and a laptop, Modern Ghana reported. Three men were arrested. \n \n More from Morning Mix: \n \n ‘All we could do was stand there’: She watched Oakland’s inferno consume the one she loved the most \n \n Canadian policeman offers heartfelt apology for threatening to punish drunk drivers with Nickelback \n \n Harper Lee would surely disapprove of the plans afoot for her Alabama home town', 'By Jennifer Froetschel, DS Public Affairs \n \n When you stepped inside a building in Accra, Ghana, you were greeted by an American flag and a photo of President Obama. It wasn’t the U.S. Embassy, however. \n \n It was not operated by the United States government, but by figures from both Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian attorney practicing immigration and criminal law. The ""consular officers"" were Turkish citizens who spoke English and Dutch. \n \n \n \n One of several buildings used by the disrupted fraud ring in Accra, Ghana. (U.S. Department of State photo) \n \n For about a decade it operated unhindered; the criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank local documents to be doctored or counterfeited. \n \n This past summer the assistant regional security officer investigator (ARSO-I) at the real U.S. Embassy in Accra, in cooperation with the Ghana Police Force, Ghana Detectives Bureau, and other international partners, shut down this “fake embassy.” \n \n \n \n Exterior of the legitimate U.S. Embassy in Accra, Ghana (U.S. Department of State photo) \n \n This investigation is a small part of the broader “Operation Spartan Vanguard"" initiative. ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" was developed by Diplomatic Security agents in the Regional Security Office (RSO) at U.S. Embassy Ghana in order to address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. Embassy and the region. \n \n During the course of another fraud investigation in ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" an informant tipped off the ARSO-I about the fraudulent document operation, as well as a fake Netherlands embassy operating in Accra. \n \n After receiving the tip, the ARSO-I, who is the point person in the RSO shop for ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" investigations, verified the information with partners within the Ghanaian Police Force. The ARSO-I then created an international task force composed of the aforementioned Ghana Police Force, as well as the Ghana Detective Bureau, Ghana SWAT, and officials from the Canadian Embassy to investigate further. \n \n The investigation identified the main architects of the criminal operation and several satellite locations (including a dress shop and an apartment building) used for operations. The “fake embassy” did not accept walk-in visa appointments; instead, they drove to the most remote parts of West Africa to find customers, advertising their services through flyers and billboards to cultivate customers from Ghana, Cote d\'Ivoire, and Togo. They would shuttle the customers to Accra, and rent them a room at a hotel nearby. The Ghanaian organized crime ring would shuttle the victims to and from the fake embassies. Locating the document vendor within the group led investigators to uncover the satellite locations and key players. \n \n When the task force conducted raids, they arrested several suspects and collected evidence that included a laptop computer; cell smart phones; counterfeit identity documents; and 150 lost, stolen, or purchased passports from 10 countries. A small number of these passports contained expired U.S. visas. The criminals would either chemically wash and doctor expired visas or use them as a blueprint in an attempt to create counterfeit visa foils. The fraud ring sold these expired and counterfeit visas and other false identification documents (including bank records, education records, birth certificates, and others) for a cost of $6,000. \n \n The dress shop acted as both a front for the operation—it was open to the general public for alterations and the purchase of dresses—as well as housing some of the document production. It was purported to house an industrial sewing machine they would use to re-create the binding on the fake passports. \n \n During the raid on the dress shop the corrupt Ghanaian attorney lied to Ghanaian detectives by telling them they were not allowed to access the shop because it was involved in an additional court case. \n \n The ""additional court case"" was determined to be fallacious, but it bought enough time for corrupt officials to arrange for bail for members of the organized crime group so that they could move the document production facility outside of Accra. Many of the documents also were exported elsewhere in Africa and to Europe through the dress shop. \n \n Several suspects remain at large, but Ghanaian police have warrants for their arrest and plan to pursue them. The investigation and search for the Turkish organized crime group is ongoing. \n \n After the operation was complete, both Interpol and the Bureau of Consular Affairs were sent the information collected to enter into their databases. At the request of the Ghana Police, DS Computer Forensic Lab will be assisting with forensic evaluation of the computer equipment seized in the operation. \n \n Successful interagency operations like this are an essential part of investigating and stopping the well-connected criminal networks perpetrating passport and visa fraud. The regional security officer in Ghana reports that as a result of this and other raids in “Operation Spartan Vanguard,” the export of fraudulent documents have decreased by 70 percent in West Africa, criminal leaders no longer have the political cover they once had, and multiple other investigative avenues have opened to DS and other law enforcement partners, and this is only the beginning.']",3,"– All it takes to convince people you're a US Embassy is an American flag, a picture of President Obama, and a whole lot of visas—at least in Ghana, where a ramshackle building in Accra housed a phony embassy really run by organized crime members from Ghana and Turkey, the Guardian reports. What wasn't fake: the US visas they got their hands on and doled out for the past decade. ""The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored,"" the US State Department said in a Nov. 2 statement (per the Washington Post, the news is only being widely reported now). A visa could be had for $6,000 from ""consular officers"" who were really Turkish citizens speaking English and Dutch; customers could also get other documents, including phony birth certificates and bank statements. The ""embassy,"" only open three days a week, advertised itself on billboards and in fliers in Ghana and other West African countries. The process of obtaining a visa legally in Ghana is a ""dreadful experience,"" per the Ghana Business News, which is how these con operations flourish. This initiative was discovered after an informant tipped off an investigator involved in a larger trafficking and fraud probe in the area; the fraudulent business was shuttered over the summer. Officials aren't saying how workers acquired the real US visas, or how many people were actually able to enter the US using them or other fake paperwork. ""Several suspects"" were busted during the raid, per the State Department, with ""several"" still on the loose. Also unearthed during the investigation: a fake Dutch operation. (Meanwhile, Afghan interpreters who helped US troops were denied visas.)"
"[""Fifteen-year-old Kenneth Shinozuka of New York City won the $50,000 Scientific American Science in Action Award in August for his invention of a wearable sensor for Alzheimer's patients. The prize, part of the Google Science Fair, recognizes a teen for an innovation that can make a practical difference by addressing an environmental, health or resources challenge. \n \n Shinozuka's creation—a small pressure sensor that can be attached to a foot or a sock—notifies caregivers via their smartphones if a patient who should be sleeping gets out of bed. His grandfather, who has Alzheimer's disease, served as inspiration. “I don't think I will ever forget my shock at seeing Grandfather in his pajamas, accompanied by a policeman who found him wandering on a nearby freeway in the middle of the night,” Shinozuka says. He designed the sensor to keep his grandfather safe and to provide much needed relief to his aunt, the primary caregiver. Shinozuka recently demonstrated the technology at a local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association and a number of care facilities. He has obtained a U.S. patent for his invention."", 'Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Teen Invents Gadgets to Aid Alzheimer\'s Patients 2:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n IRVINE, Calif. — Reclined in a plush red chair by a sunny window, Ida Mitchell taps her black slippers to the rhythm of the guitar and nods in time with the music. Next to her in the living room, half a dozen residents delicately clap their age-worn hands and sing along to ""I\'ve Been Working on the Railroad."" Ida will tell you with a smile about her love for bridge and for riding horses. She might tell you more than once. \n \n Ida, 88, is a resident of Irvine Cottages, an assisted living facility in Irvine, California. Those living here suffer from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. And while they enjoy the guitar playing and sing-alongs, there is an extra something special in store for them today. \n \n Kenneth Shinozuka will soon start the eleventh grade. He\'s a Boy Scout and a lover of the outdoors, and he wants to someday cure Alzheimer\'s Disease. \n \n Shinozuka, 15, crosses the cheerily decorated room with its floral paintings and karaoke station, and greets Ida with a handshake and polite salutations. Then, he gets down to business. \n \n ""I made this sock that lets Conrad know when you walk off your chair or out of bed, and lets him know if you need help,"" Shinozuka says, referring to Ida\'s nurse. \n \n ""Oh really?"" Ida asks. ""That\'s pretty clever."" \n \n ""Thank you,"" he says, in his characteristic politeness. ""So we\'re going to put the sock on you know, if that\'s okay."" Delicately, he kneels down and slides a blue gingham sock equipped with a sensor on Ida\'s right foot. \n \n According to the Alzheimer\'s Association, of the estimated five million Americans with the disease, about 60 percent of them wander — and often become dangerously lost — as a result. \n \n Shinozuka has invented a pressure sensor that when worn on the bottom of the foot or with a sock detects an increase in pressure and wirelessly sends an alert to a caregiver\'s smartphone. Not only did Shinozuka come up with the gadget from scratch and teach himself how to make it, but he\'s also beta testing it on patients like Ida this summer. \n \n The CEO and founder of Irvine Cottages, gerontologist Jacqueline Dupont recalls the day earlier this summer when the eager 15-year-old called her saying he wanted to help her patients. \n \n ""I just couldn\'t believe that anyone so young could achieve so much,"" says Dupont. ""I thought he was a college student!"" \n \n Shinozuka gets that a lot. \n \n He\'s matter-of-fact as he reviews his device with Dr. Dupont. ""Pressure is applied, the alert is sounded,"" says Shinozuka, squeezing the white, lima-bean sized sensor and triggering a musical chime on the iPhone in his other hand. \n \n ""Oh good. I like the alert. It\'s much less obnoxious than the other alarms we use. They scare the residents down the hall,"" says Dupont. In Irvine Cottages and in assisted living facilities across the country, many of the sensors used to detect when seniors have fallen or left an area have burdensome wires that must be clipped to clothing and loud alarms that frighten patients. Shinozuka\'s device instead directly alerts the caregiver via a wireless signal. \n \n That idea came from personal experience. \n \n ""My grandfather has lost the capability to eat by himself, to walk by himself, definitely to write and read. He can barely speak anymore. So it\'s very hard,"" says Shinozuka. ""It\'s also very hard for my aunt, his primary caregiver, since she\'s the one who has to take care of him all the time."" \n \n Courtesy Maria Feng \n \n Shinozuka\'s grandfather, Deming, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s when Shinozuka was four years old and he regularly wanders out of bed at night. In the first six months Shinozuka attached his device, called the ""Safe Wander,"" to his grandfather\'s sock, it detected all of Deming\'s 437 known cases of wandering out of bed with no false alarms. \n \n His mother, Maria Feng, remembers that breakthrough. ""We were so proud, and we also felt the power of the invention. The power of the technology. It was such a great moment."" \n \n Now, Shinozuka hopes to bring that “moment” to more families. ""I hope that my device will ultimately reach out to the tens of millions of wandering patients around the world and also relieve the burdens on their caregivers,"" he said. \n \n His innovation has already won him a $50,000 prize and ""Science in Action"" award from Scientific American Magazine. \n \n He will also compete in the Google Science Fair in September in California. But he\'s looking farther into the future than that: he hopes to be a neuroscientist and specialize in engineering and computer science. \n \n ""I\'d like to solve some of the mysteries of the brain, and invent tools to ultimately, I think, cure Alzheimer\'s and other mental conditions that our aging population suffers from,"" says Shinozuka.', 'Existing technologies did not provide a solution to my problem. For instance, widely used GPS tracking devices do not work indoors. More recent real-time locating systems based on radio-frequency (RF) ID tags are neither accurate nor quick enough to detect patients’ leaving bed. Initially, I considered attaching pressure sensors to the legs of a bed, but the system would be expensive and could trigger a false alarm from my grandmother, who was sleeping on the same bed as my grandfather. \n \n One night, I was looking after my grandfather and saw him step out of bed. The moment his foot landed on the floor, a light bulb flashed in my head. Why don’t I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot? The moment he steps onto the floor, the sensor would detect the pressure caused by his body weight, and the signal could wirelessly trigger an audible alert in my aunt’s Smartphone. This would enable my aunt to sleep much better at night without worrying about Grandfather. \n \n I immediately put down my thoughts in a sketch (Fig. 1) and started research. First, I had to find a pressure sensor that was thin and flexible enough not to affect the comfort of walking. An extensive literature search led me to a film sensor printed with pressure-sensitive ink. When pressure is applied, the ink becomes more electrically conductive. The pressure can thus be calculated by measuring the conductivity. I also thought about creating a sensor out of conductive rubber, but found it difficult to make such a sensor thin enough after testing material samples. \n \n My second challenge was designing a wearable circuit to acquire signal from the pressure sensor and wirelessly trigger an alert in a remote Smartphone when the pressure exceeds a certain threshold. The circuit needed to be compact, lightweight and human-friendly. However, the energy-consuming wireless transmission requires large, heavy batteries. A search of state-of-the-art wireless systems led me to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a rapidly-evolving, revolutionary wireless technology that has recently enabled the creation of many novel wearable systems. Implementing BLE required a significant amount of expertise, which I had to acquire through extensive studying and testing of BLE modules. After months of research, I was able to design a circuit that would integrate such a module with my film sensor and be powered by a coin battery. \n \n In addition, I needed to design apps to transform a Smartphone into a caretaker’s monitor. I took online courses and tutorials to learn coding for the most widely-used Android and iOS phones. With the help of a mentor, I deepened my knowledge about the core Bluetooth framework, which enabled me to establish communications between the BLE circuit and Smartphone while minimizing energy consumption. \n \n This research convinced me of the feasibility of my proposed wearable sensor system, thanks to the recent advances in Smartphones and BLE wireless technologies. I made a one-year project plan with five major tasks to realize my proposed sensor system (Table 1).']",3,"– When Kenneth Shinozuka's grandfather, who has Alzheimer's, was found wandering on a freeway at night, it left a deep impression on the 15-year-old; now he has been recognized for an invention to make sure it never happens again. The device is a pressure sensor that can be worn as a sock or attached to the foot of a patient. If that patient gets out of bed, his or her caretaker is alerted via smartphone, Scientific American reports. Shinozuka has won the magazine's $50,000 Science in Action Award for the device via Google's Science Fair. ""My grandfather is one of the 5.2 million Alzheimer’s patients in the U.S., 65% of whom wander,"" the teen writes at the Science Fair's site. His research shows the invention works: ""A six-month trial on my grandfather validated my hypothesis: the systems detected 100% of the 437 known cases of his wandering and issued alerts within one second of his stepping out of bed."" As for future plans, he's been testing the device on other patients, and he tells NBC News that he hopes it ""will ultimately reach out to the tens of millions of wandering patients around the world and also relieve the burdens on their caregivers."" The news comes after another teen developed a potentially life-saving system of her own—this one for kids in hot cars."
"['One problem, in Mr. Oppenheim’s view, was the lack of on-the-record, on-camera interviews. \n \n “We repeatedly made clear to Ronan and Rich McHugh the standard for publication is we needed at least one credible on-the-record victim or witness of misconduct,” Mr. Oppenheim said. “And we never met that threshold while Ronan was reporting for us.” \n \n Mr. Oppenheim added that the day before the planned trip, Mr. Farrow had asked to pursue the story for another outlet. \n \n “Ronan reached out to us and said: ‘I want to get this out now. I have a magazine that’s willing to do it. Will you be O.K. if I take the reporting to this magazine?’” Mr. Oppenheim said. “And we granted him permission to do so.” \n \n Soon after that mid-August conversation, however, Mr. Farrow, whom NBC described as a nonexclusive contributor, requested the use of an NBC camera crew for the interview in Los Angeles. That request seemed to suggest that he was open to staying on the story for the network. Mr. Oppenheim shot down the request, severing the network’s relationship with the reporter. \n \n Mr. Oppenheim recalled the conversation: “We said: ‘You’ve asked for permission to go elsewhere. You can’t use an NBC camera crew for another outlet. You can do whatever you want to do. And you don’t work for us.’” \n \n Mr. Farrow implied that the network had mishandled his work during an appearance on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC program that aired shortly after the publication of his first Weinstein article. “I walked into the door at The New Yorker with an explosively reportable piece that should have been public earlier,” he said. \n \n On Twitter last fall, Mr. Farrow praised Mr. McHugh, saying he had “refused to bow to pressure to stop, through numerous shoots, even when it meant risking his job.” He also called him an “unsung hero of this entire story.”', 'The producer who worked alongside Ronan Farrow at NBC News on his Harvey Weinstein investigation quit in protest earlier this month. \n \n Rich McHugh tendered his resignation on Friday, Aug. 17, a year to the day that the Weinstein story left with Farrow. Since then, Farrow has won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles that revealed allegations of sexual harassment and assault—and questions have lingered about why the network gave up on the story that helped launch the #MeToo movement. \n \n NBC News has long insisted the Weinstein exposé wasn’t ready to run on air or online, contrary to Farrow’s claims that it was. Farrow’s story, which ultimately ran in The New Yorker, was part of a series that ultimately won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, earned him in the prestigious George Polk Award for National Reporting, and garnered near-universal praise from his colleagues. \n \n The Daily Beast has uncovered new details of how the process went awry, including alleged threats from NBC, back-biting inside the network about who was truly responsible, and a previously unreported ultimatum by Weinstein’s attorneys. \n \n According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, NBCUniversal deputy general counsel Susan Weiner made a series of phone calls to Farrow, threatening to smear him if he continued to report on Weinstein. \n \n A spokesperson for NBC News, speaking on the condition of anonymity, vigorously denied those allegations. “Absolutely false,” the spokesperson told The Daily Beast. “There’s no truth to that all. There is no chance, in no version of the world, that Susan Weiner would tell Ronan Farrow what he could or could not report on. \n \n “The sole point of the Susan Weiner’s conversation with Farrow, roughly a month after he had left NBC, was to make sure he wasn’t still telling sources that he was working on the story for NBC since he had moved on to The New Yorker.” \n \n In February 2015, Farrow lost his daytime show on MSNBC and began working with NBC News’ investigative unit. In November 2016, Farrow and a producer named Rich McHugh decided they wanted to do a story about Hollywood’s “casting couch,” the longtime practice of producers and other powerful men exchanging sex with women for film roles, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The story was timed to be released around the Academy Awards, these sources said. \n \n They presented the idea to NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, who suggested the team look into a October 2016 tweet by actress Rose McGowan that she was raped by a Hollywood executive, according to two sources with knowledge of the investigation. \n \n Over the next several months, Farrow collected evidence that suggested Weinstein had a pattern of inappropriate behavior toward women, according to the sources and previous reporting by The Daily Beast, HuffPost, and The New York Times. Weinstein has repeatedly denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. Sources familiar with the matter previously told The Daily Beast that at least eight women accusing Weinstein had agreed to go on camera, including two alleged victims with their names and faces. \n \n In an interview with The New York Times published Thursday night, McHugh accused “the very highest levels of NBC” of later stopping the reporting. \n \n “There was not one single victim or witness to misconduct by Harvey Weinstein who was willing to go on the record. Not one,” the spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \n \n By February, according to the sources, Farrow had secured an on-the-record interview with McGowan in which the actress said she had been sexually harassed by a powerful producer, though she did not name Weinstein. (McGowan subsequently named Weinstein during the NBC investigation, according to a source with knowledge of the story, but reportedly pulled her interview after being legally threatened by Weinstein, who had reached a $100,000 settlement with her in 1997 after she accused him of sexual assault.) \n \n Farrow and McHugh also obtained a bombshell audio recording from a NYPD sting in which Weinstein admitted to groping Filipina-Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez in 2015. (The Battilana audio was subsequently published by The New Yorker.) \n \n “The tape on its own was color, it added to an already known accusation,” an NBC spokesperson said. While it was “absolutely significant” to hear Battilana’s voice, the spokesperson said, the tape alone would not expose Weinstein as serial sexual predator, as has been alleged. \n \n NBC’s reluctance stoked Farrow and McHugh’s concerns about NBC’s commitment to the story, the sources said. Farrow did not respond to a request for comment. Ari Wilkenfeld, McHugh’s attorney, told The Daily Beast that his client “has no comment.” \n \n In spring 2017, according to the sources, Farrow played Oppenheim the audio of Weinstein with Battilana admitting that he was “used to” groping women’s breasts. At one point during their meeting, according to two sources, Oppenheim had asked if people still cared about Weinstein. \n \n “ Farrow played Oppenheim the audio of Weinstein with Battilana admitting that he was ‘used to’ groping women’s breasts. According to two sources, Oppenheim asked if people still cared about Weinstein. ” \n \n “That is absolutely false,” a NBC spokesperson said, “and it is clearly contradicted by the fact that Oppenheim assigned the story on Harvey Weinstein in the first place. Obviously he understood him to be and believed him to be a newsworthy figure.” \n \n Farrow had begun to suspect that Oppenheim—who moonlighted as a Hollywood screenwriter—was potentially communicating with Weinstein directly about the story, according to the sources. \n \n During a meeting in summer 2017, Oppenheim mentioned to Farrow that Weinstein had raised objections to Farrow’s reporting—even though Farrow had not yet asked Weinstein to comment on the allegations, according to individuals briefed on the meeting. \n \n “Externally, I had Weinstein associates calling me repeatedly,” McHugh told the Times. “I knew that Weinstein was calling NBC executives directly. One time it even happened when we were in the room.” \n \n HuffPost reported last year that Oppenheim had relayed concerns from Weinstein’s lawyers that Farrow could not report the story because the producer had worked with his estranged father, director Woody Allen. “No, absolutely not, and Noah Oppenheim never had a conversation with Harvey Weinstein about the content of NBC News’ investigation,” the network spokesperson said. \n \n By August 2017, Farrow was prepared to fly to California to interview a woman who was going to claim in silhouette on camera that Weinstein had raped her, according to the sources. Farrow wanted to publish this interview and what he had already gathered, but network higher-ups said he needed more and would not allow Farrow to use an NBC News crew for the interview, according to a person familiar with the matter. \n \n “Three days before Ronan and I were going to head to L.A. to interview a woman with a credible rape allegation against Harvey Weinstein,” McHugh told the Times, “I was ordered to stop, not to interview this woman. And to stand down on the story altogether.” \n \n In an interview with the Times, Oppenheim recalled telling Farrow, “You can’t use an NBC camera crew for another outlet. You can do whatever you want to do. And you don’t work for us.” \n \n Farrow went ahead with the interview anyway, paying for a camera crew out of his own pocket, according to sources. \n \n “The reason the reporting stopped here is because Ronan asked to take it elsewhere because NBC News’ determination at the time was that you don’t have it yet,” the network spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \n \n Dejected, Farrow approached longtime New Yorker media writer Ken Auletta seeking advice about what to do with his reporting and where to take the story. Farrow had interviewed Auletta, who had twice previously attempted to report news about Weinstein’s alleged behavior, for the NBC story the previous month. Auletta suggested bringing the story to The New Yorker and called Editor in Chief David Remnick, who accepted the idea. \n \n According to multiple sources, Weinstein attorney Charles Harder claimed in legal threats to Farrow and others that NBC News gave them written assurances that Farrow would not use any reporting he obtained about Weinstein during his time at the network. Harder did not respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment. \n \n “We immediately were clear with Weinstein’s legal team that we disputed the characterizations,” the NBC spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \n \n Despite letters from Weinstein’s attorneys, Farrow and The New Yorker decided to press on and eventually published the piece just days after The New York Times released its own bombshell report about Weinstein’s history of alleged sexual misconduct and the use of settlements and nondisclosure agreements to silence accusers. \n \n Immediately after Farrow published his bombshell at The New Yorker, top figures at NBC began pointing fingers at each other, two sources said. \n \n While Oppenheim told staffers at a division-wide town hall meeting that he took responsibility for the decision to let the story go, he privately told at least one colleague that NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack and Senior Communications Vice President Mark Kornblau had made him a scapegoat. \n \n “He said to me, ‘It wasn’t my decision,’” said the colleague who spoke to Oppenheim after Farrow’s story was published at The New Yorker. “‘Mark Kornblau and Andy Lack are trying to throw me under the bus when it was Andy’s decision,’” the colleague recalled Oppenheim saying. \n \n “This conversation is made up out of whole cloth, never happened. There is no daylight between Andy and Noah,” the spokesperson said. \n \n While multiple higher-ups at NBC have repeatedly attempted to dismiss criticism of the network’s failure to publish the Weinstein story, questions about NBC’s decision are likely to cause more headaches in the coming months. \n \n Earlier this year, publisher Little, Brown announced it was publishing a book by Farrow entitled Catch & Kill, in which he is expected to share his recollection of NBC’s decisions around the Weinstein story and report more broadly on the conspiracy of silence that protects powerful men. \n \n — with additional reporting by Lloyd Grove \n \n Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Weiner’s title. We regret the error.']",2,"– Soon after Ronan Farrow's Pulitzer Prize-winning expose on Harvey Weinstein ran in the New Yorker came word that he had originally been working on the piece for NBC News. Farrow said the network dropped the story, and when initially asked why, he said, ""You would have to ask NBC and NBC executives about the details."" Now, those details may be emerging, at least via a former producer with the network who spoke to the New York Times and via the Daily Beast's sources. NBC News very vocally denies the new claim that it tried to kill the story, and Farrow had no comment. The Beast lays out a timeline dating to November 2016, when Farrow and producer Rich McHugh decided to report on Hollywood's infamous ""casting couch"" and were reportedly advised by NBC News President Noah Oppenheim to look into Rose McGowan's October 2016 tweet about rape at the hands of a Hollywood exec."
"['Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Malaria parasites - seen here infecting red blood cells - and mosquitoes do not like cold temperatures \n \n Warmer temperatures are causing malaria to spread to higher altitudes, a study suggests. \n \n Researchers have found that people living in the highlands of Africa and South America are at an increased risk of catching the mosquito-borne disease during hotter years. \n \n They believe that temperature rises in the future could result in millions of additional cases in some areas. \n \n The research is published in the journal Science. \n \n Prof Mercedes Pascual, from the University of Michigan in the US, who carried out the research, said: ""The impact in terms of increasing the risk of exposure to disease is very large."" \n \n Vulnerable to disease \n \n Areas at higher altitudes have traditionally provided a haven from this devastating disease. \n \n This expansion could in a sense account for a substantial part of the increase of cases we have already observed in these areas Professor Mercedes Pascual, University of Michigan \n \n Both the malaria parasite and the mosquito that carries it struggle to cope with the cooler air. \n \n Prof Pascual said: ""The risk of the disease decreases with altitude and this is why historically people have settled in these higher regions."" \n \n But the scientists say the disease is entering new regions that had previously been malaria-free. \n \n To investigate, scientists looked at densely populated areas in the highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia, where there are detailed records of both temperature and malaria cases from the 1990s to 2005. \n \n They found that in warmer years, malaria shifted higher into the mountains, while in cooler years it was limited to lower elevations. \n \n ""This expansion could in a sense account for a substantial part of the increase of cases we have already observed in these areas,"" said Prof Pascual. \n \n Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The highlands of Ethiopia could be more vulnerable to malaria if temperatures rise \n \n The team believes that rising temperatures could cause a further spread. \n \n In Ethiopia, where nearly half of the population live at an altitude of between 1,600m (5,250ft) and 2,400m, the scientists believe there could be many more cases. \n \n ""We have estimated that, based on the distribution of malaria with altitude, a 1C rise in temperature could lead to an additional three million cases in under-15-year-olds per year,"" said Prof Pascual. \n \n The team believes that because people living in areas that have never been exposed to malaria are particularly vulnerable to the disease, attempts to stop the spread should be focused on areas at the edge of the spread. The disease is easier to control there than at lower altitudes where it has already established. \n \n According to the latest estimates from the World Health Organization, there were about 207 million cases of malaria in 2012 and an estimated 627,000 deaths. Most deaths occur among children living in Africa.', 'Malaria is one of the most common—and deadly—infectious diseases in the world, sickening more than 300 million people a year and killing over 600,000 people . But because it\'s a mosquito-borne disease—the parasite that causes malaria is passed to human beings by mosquito bites—its range has been limited to warmer tropical areas, the so-called ""malaria belt."" And even within tropical countries, altitude matters: the disease is much less common in tropical highlands, where colder temperatures slow down both the mosquito and the development of the parasite within it. It\'s not for nothing that 19th century British colonists would build hill stations in malaria-prone countries like India, to escape both heat and disease. \n \n So it\'s not surprising either that scientists have been trying to find out for years whether climate change might expand the range of malaria, putting millions of people who live in tropical highlands at risk. Warmer temperatures should mean more malaria, but in recent years the number of cases has actually fallen dramatically , largely because of renewed efforts to fight the disease. But now a new study in Science makes a strong case that as the climate warms, malaria will indeed be on the march, expanding its range to previously safe high-altitude territory, putting even more pressure on prevention campaigns—and if those fail, leading to more deaths. \n \n Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Michigan sifted through regional records in Ethiopia and Colombia, two tropical countries with highland territory, looking at malaria cases from 1990 to 2005 in Colombia and 1993 to 2005 in Ethiopia. They corrected for other factors that might influence malaria cases—mosquito control programs, for example, which lead to fewer of the insects; and rainfall, which leads to more—and found that the median altitude of malaria cases moved higher in warm years, and lower during cooler yields. All else being equal, as the planet warms, it seems likely that malaria will become more dangerous to more people. \n \n ""This is indisputable evidence of a climate effect,"" said Mercedes Pascual, a disease ecologist at Michigan and one of authors of the Science paper. ""Our findings here underscore the size of the problem and emphasize the need for sustained intervention efforts in these regions, especially in Africa."" \n \n One thing that will make the problem worse is that people who live in tropical highlands tend to be much more vulnerable to malaria parasites to begin with because they\'ve never been infected before. In an earlier paper, the Science researchers estimated that a 1° C (1.8° F) temperature increase could lead to an additional 3 million malaria cases in Ethiopian children, assuming control methods weren\'t strengthened. And that\'s the key point. While global warming will put more people around the world at risk for malaria and other tropical diseases, climate is far from the only factor at work. Developed cities like Singapore are well within the malaria belt, but the disease has been virtually eradicated there thanks to stringent control methods. Malaria was rampant in U.S. states like Georgia as late as the 1920s, but it\'s long gone now , eliminated by control efforts that led to the creation of the Centers for Disease Control. And even in Africa, malaria incidences have fallen by 31% since 2000— as the climate has warmed—and globally 3.3 million malaria deaths have been avoided thanks to the work of institutions like the Gates Foundation . Malaria, like many infectious diseases, is first and foremost a problem of development and poverty—and when those are addressed, infections fall. \n \n But by expanding the range of malaria, climate change will make a tough challenge all the more difficult. It\'s just one more way carbon can kill.']",2,"– Efforts to eradicate malaria are going to be hit hard by rising temperatures that open up new altitudes to the mosquitoes that carry the disease, researchers warn. Both mosquitoes and the malaria parasite struggle in chillier temperatures, and a new study has found that the disease climbs to higher elevations in warmer years, the BBC reports. In areas like the highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia, people have never been exposed to malaria, making them especially vulnerable to the spread of the disease. ""We have estimated that, based on the distribution of malaria with altitude, a 1C rise in temperature could lead to an additional three million cases in under-15-year-olds per year,"" one of the researchers warns. Malaria infects more than 200 million people per year and kills around 600,000 of them, mainly children in Africa. But climate isn't the only factor at work in its spread, with the biggest advances in malaria control coming alongside efforts to combat poverty, Time notes."
"['WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cutting off U.S. funding to the United Nations agency for reproductive health under an abortion-related provision in a law that Democratic and Republican administrations have used as a cudgel in the global culture wars. \n \n The U.N. Population Fund will lose $32.5 million in funding from the 2017 budget, the State Department said, with funds shifted to similar programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development. The administration accused the agency, through its work with China\'s government, of supporting population control programs in China that include coercive abortion. \n \n It wasn\'t immediately clear whether the U.N. fund would also lose out on tens of millions of additional dollars it has typically received from the U.S. in ""non-core"" funds. \n \n By halting assistance to the U.N. Population Fund, the Trump administration is following through on promises to let socially conservative policies that President Donald Trump embraced in his campaign determine the way the U.S. government operates and conducts itself in the world. Though focused on forced abortion — a concept opposed by liberals and conservatives alike — the move to invoke the ""Kemp-Kasten amendment"" was sure to be perceived as a gesture to anti-abortion advocates and other conservative interests. \n \n The policy change comes days before Trump is set to host Chinese President Xi Jinping for a highly anticipated meeting at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. In a shift from President Barack Obama\'s approach, Trump has avoided elevating human rights concerns in diplomacy, with White House officials saying those issues are most effectively advanced by raising them with foreign leaders in private. \n \n Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called it a ""grave error"" that sent a dangerous message about the administration\'s policies toward women. He predicted women and girls ""will suffer."" \n \n ""Donald Trump should put the health and dignity of women ahead of political points and reverse this decision immediately,"" said Engel, D-N.Y. \n \n Under a three-decade-old law, the U.S. is barred from funding organizations that aid or participate in forced abortion of involuntary sterilization. It\'s up to each administration to determine which organizations meet that condition. The U.N. Population Fund has typically been cut off by Republican presidents and restored when Democrats control the White House. \n \n In a lengthy memorandum obtained by The Associated Press, the State Department said the U.N. fund partners with China\'s National Health and Family Planning Commission, responsible for overseeing China\'s ""two-child policy."" It said the U.N. collaborates with the Chinese agency on family planning. Still, the memo acknowledged there was no evidence of U.N. support for forced abortions or sterilization in China. \n \n The U.N. Population Fund, known as UNFPA, said it regretted the U.S. move and argued it was ""erroneous"" to suggest it was complicit in China\'s policies. \n \n ""UNFPA refutes this claim, as all of its work promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination,"" the agency said in a statement. \n \n Starting in 1979, China had a ""one-child policy"" enforced in many cases with state-mandated abortions. But the policy was eased over the years, and now allows married couples to have two children, in a nod to the aging population in the world\'s most populous country. \n \n The designation was the latest move by the Trump administration to prioritize traditionally conservative issues in the federal budget. The Trump administration has vowed to cut all dollars for climate change programming, and also restored the so-called global gag rule, which prohibits funding to non-governmental groups that support even voluntary abortions. \n \n The Trump administration has also signaled that it no longer sees a need for the U.S. to so generously fund U.N. and other international organizations. The White House has proposed cutting roughly one-third from the State Department\'s budget, with much of it expected to come from foreign aid and global organization dollars, although Congress is expected to restore at least some of that funding \n \n The U.N. agency\'s mission involves promoting universal access to family planning and reproductive health, with a goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices like female genital mutilation. The cut-off funds will be ""reprogrammed"" to USAID\'s Global Health Programs account to focus on similar issues, said a State Department official, who wasn\'t authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity. \n \n The Kemp-Kasten amendment, enacted in 1985, led to some of the U.N. agency\'s funding being initially cut off, then restored by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, USAID said in a report. Republican George W. Bush\'s administration reversed the decision in 2002, but President Barack Obama — a Democrat — gave the funding back after taking office. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations and AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP', 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The State Department said on Monday it was ending U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund, the international body’s agency focused on family planning as well as maternal and child health in more than 150 countries. \n \n In a letter to U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, the State Department said it was dropping the funding because the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) “supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.” \n \n The cut marks U.S. President Donald Trump’s first move to curtail funding for the United Nations and is likely to raise further questions about how deep those cuts will eventually go throughout the organization, where the United States is the top donor. \n \n It comes after Trump in January reinstated the so-called Mexico City Policy that withholds U.S. funding for international organizations that perform abortions or provide information about abortion. \n \n Known by critics as the “global gag” rule, Trump broadened its scope to include all global health assistance in his Jan. 23 executive order that withholds at least half a billion dollars in U.S. funds. A lack of clarity around the rule, however, has left aid groups scrambling and both Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers seeking clarity. \n \n In a statement on its website, UNFPA said it regrets the U.S. decision to end funding, which it said is based on an “erroneous claim” that the agency supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China. \n \n UNFPA said its mission is “to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.” \n \n “The support we received over the years from the government and people of the United States has saved tens of thousands of mothers from preventable deaths and disabilities, and especially now in the rapidly developing global humanitarian crises,” the statement said. \n \n The cut follows Trump’s proposed 28 percent budget reduction for diplomacy and foreign aid, including an unspecified reduction in financial support for the United Nations and its agencies, announced last month. \n \n U.N. agencies such as the UNFPA are funded by governments voluntarily. The United States was the fourth-largest voluntary donor to UNFPA in 2015, giving $75 million in core budget and earmarked contributions. \n \n U.N. officials have warned that abrupt funding cuts could trigger more global instability and argued that dollars for diplomacy are more effective than military spending in combating terrorism.', 'The designations employed and the presentation of material on the map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of UNFPA concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The dotted line represents approximately the Line of Control \n \n in Jammu and Kashmir agreed upon by India and Pakistan. The final status of Jammu and Kashmir has not yet been agreed upon by the parties.']",3,"– Just days after he took office in January, President Trump put back in place the ""Mexico City policy"" that keeps federal funds from being funneled to international aid organizations that provide abortions, or even info about them. Now the United States has officially yanked US donations from the United Nations Population Fund (aka UNFPA), the arm of the UN that offers family-planning services in more than 150 nations, Reuters reports. The BBC notes that $32.5 million that was set to be allotted for 2017 will be rescinded, with a Monday letter from the State Department saying the withdrawal of the funds is because UNFPA ""supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization"" in China. The US is one of UNFPA's largest benefactors, coming in fourth for 2015 with just over $75,000 in combined core and earmarked contributions. UNFPA—which relies on voluntary donations from global governments to provide its services, which include those for maternal and child health—put out a Tuesday statement noting the US decision was based on an ""erroneous claim"" about the group's work, which it says lets ""individuals and couples ... make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination."" The State Department letter says the money will be reallocated to the Global Health Programs account, where it will reportedly be put toward family planning, maternal health, and reproductive health in developing countries. The AP notes the UNFPA fund has traditionally seen the ax whenever the GOP is in the White House; Dems reinstate it when they take back control."
"[""The pair were reconvicted of the crime last month, but reports have started to emerge that suggest the 29-year-old Italian is looking to distance himself from Knox in the lead-up to their next supreme court appeal hearing. \n \n Speaking in an interview broadcast on Italian TV, Sollecito said the American had left his flat on the morning when Ms Kercher’s body was found to take a shower, returning hours later appearing “very agitated”. \n \n He said Knox told him her front door had been broken into and that she had found small bloodstains in the bathroom, according to footage aired on NBC’s Today programme yesterday. \n \n “Certainly I asked her questions,” Sollecito said. “Why did you take a shower? Why did you spend so much time there?” \n \n Responding to the Italian reporter’s question of what answers he could give for those questions, he said: “I don’t have answers.” \n \n The exchange comes after Knox posted an email from Sollecito on her blog earlier this month, in which he wrote: “I don't want to be punished for, nor have to continue to justify, those things that regard you and not me.” \n \n NBC’s legal analyst Lisa Bloom said: “I think he's distancing himself from her. He's saying that there is some evidence that may apply to her, which doesn't apply to him.” \n \n Kercher's sister, Stephanie Kercher (L) and brother Lyle Kercher speak during a press conference in Florence, 2014 As well as posting an image online in which she holds up a sign saying “we are innocent” in Italian, Knox denied that her former boyfriend was abandoning his defence of her. \n \n “This is not the case,” she said. “Raffaele has plenty of reason for resentment, but not against me. The only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my alibi. \n \n “He is collateral damage in the unreasonable, irresponsible, and unrelenting scapegoating of the prosecution’s grotesque caricature that is ‘Foxy Knoxy’.” \n \n Both she and Sollecito are appealing the reconvictions, with the case due to be heard by Italy's Supreme Court by early 2015. \n \n Knox, 26, was sentenced to 28 years and six months in prison, while Sollecito, 29, was given a 25 year sentence. A third person who was convicted over Ms Kercher’s death, Rudy Guede, is currently serving a 16-year sentence. \n \n Earlier this month, Ms Kercher’s family launched an impassioned plea for her memory to be honoured, and that they were desperate for “some sort of closure”. \n \n Her sister Stephanie said: “Just having an end of the Italian justice system and knowing that's the final decision, and then we can start to remember just Meredith.”"", 'FLORENCE, Italy, Feb. 25 (UPI) -- Raffaele Sollecito has consistently stood by his ex-girlfriend Amanda Knox in the years since they were found guilty of Meredith Kercher\'s murder, exonerated and found guilty again. \n \n But in a new interview with Italian TV, Sollecito, 29, said he ""questioned"" Knox\'s strange behavior in the hours before police found Kercher\'s body. \n \n Sollecito said Knox left his apartment to take a shower, then returned hours later looking ""very agitated.""

Actually, Attorney Bongiorno’s closing arguments and Raffaele’s latest statements pinpoint and attack a fundamental weakness in the prosecution’s case against both Raffaele and me that has been ignored for far too long: Raffaele is not a slave. \n \n The prosecution’s case relies upon the idea that the brutal murder of Meredith Kercher hinges upon me: that only I could have facilitated access to her; that only I could have had motive to instigate the assault and plunge in the knife. As for Raffaele, because he had only just met Meredith and had never met Rudy Guede, the prosecution tried to depict him as both predisposed to violent sexual fetish and absolutely subservient to a dominant female companion. They cited his habit of carrying a pocketknife (which did not correspond with Meredith’s stab wounds), his Japanese comic book collection (which included girl-power Sailor Moon), an incident at school when he was caught viewing porn, and the one Marilyn Manson song on his computer. Because he was present and supportive of me in the immediacy of the discovery of the murder and because my surviving roommates had described us as piccioncini (“lovebirds”—a far cry from the dominatrix/slave), the prosecution assumed and pursued the theory of Raffaele’s unquestioning devotion/obsession with me. \n \n The prosecution has sustained this theory for years even when, to begin with, the case was convoluted and objectively baseless, especially against Raffaele. An unreliable trace of Raffaele’s DNA on Meredith’s bra clasp. A partial bloody footprint on a bathmat that more closely corresponds with Rudy Guede’s footprints. The unreliable testimony of a homeless, heroin-using serial witness who claims to have seen Raffaele and I in Piazza Grimana between 9-11:30 p.m. the night of the murder. That’s the entire case against him. \n \n In a recent email exchange, Raffaele expressed his frustration to me: “I don’t want to be punished for, nor have to continue to justify, those things that regard you and not me. Obviously the evidence demonstrates both of our innocence, but it seems that for the judges and the people this objectivity is of no importance.” The point being that the prosecution’s case is founded upon unreliable and irrelevant circumstantial evidence that most often has nothing to do with Raffaele at all. As tenuous as the case is against me, it is illogical and unfair that Raffaele should be held legally answerable for it. No judicial panel in their right mind can determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for Raffaele based on the objective evidence specifically related to him that the prosecution presented in court. \n \n Raffaele’s experience of surviving injustice, documented courageously and honestly in his memoir Honor Bound, has been uniquely traumatic and desperate. Part of that struggle has been having to come to terms with the fact that his judicial system has disregarded him as an individual who is capable of self-determination and owed the presumption of innocence until proven otherwise. \n \n Raffaele has plenty of reason for resentment, but not against me. The only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my alibi. He is collateral damage in the unreasonable, irresponsible, and unrelenting scapegoating of the prosecution’s grotesque caricature that is “Foxy Knoxy”.', 'Crawl of outlinks from wikipedia.org started March, 2016.

"['A bioterrorist attack against the United States is a constant threat with potentially devastating consequences, including mass casualties, economic instability, and damage to critical infrastructure. Established in 2003, the DHS BioWatch Program provides early warning of a bioterrorist attack in more than 30 major metropolitan areas across the country. This early warning helps decision makers plan an effective, coordinated, and rapid response. \n \n BioWatch is managed by the DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. \n \n How Does It Work \n \n The BioWatch Program provides air-monitoring, analysis, notification procedures, and risk assessment to 30+ jurisdictions. This program can substantially minimize the catastrophic impact of a biological attack. \n \n BioWatch involves a large network of stakeholders from public health, emergency management, law enforcement, laboratory, scientific, and environmental health organizations around the country who collaborate to detect and prepare a coordinated response to a bioterrorism attack. \n \n Future of BioWatch \n \n As terrorism evolves, DHS constantly improves its programs in order to stay ahead of the enemy. Currently, DHS is working to upgrade biodetection technology with the intention of: \n \n better addressing a wide range of bioterrorism threats; \n \n providing real-time data across the Homeland Security enterprise; and \n \n improving information-sharing between federal, state, and local operators. \n \n This upgrade to a sustainable, efficient biodetection capability will make Americans safer by improving the ability of first responders and decision makers to act quickly after an attack.', '(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security documents critiquing the response to a simulated anthrax attack on Super Bowl Sunday were marked ""For Official Use Only"" and ""important for national security."" \n \n Recipients of the draft ""after-action"" reports were told to keep them locked up after business hours and to shred them prior to discarding. They were admonished not to share their contents with anyone who lacked ""an operational need-to-know."" \n \n But security surrounding the December 2017 reports suffered an embarrassing breach: \n \n A CNN employee discovered copies of them, along with other sensitive DHS material, in the seat-back pocket of a commercial plane. The reports were accompanied by the travel itinerary and boarding pass of the government scientist in charge of BioWatch, the DHS program that conducted the anthrax drills in preparation for Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis. \n \n The reports were based on exercises designed to evaluate the ability of public health, law enforcement and emergency management officials to engage in a coordinated response were a biological attack to be carried out in Minneapolis on Super Bowl Sunday. \n \n The exercises identified several areas for improvement, including the problem that ""some local law enforcement and emergency management agencies possess only a cursory knowledge of the BioWatch program and its mission."" \n \n CNN decided to withhold publication of this article until after the Super Bowl after government officials voiced concerns that publishing it prior to the game could jeopardize security for the event. A DHS official told CNN that areas for improvement identified in the draft reports had been addressed prior to Sunday\'s game and that the agency had ""great confidence"" in its preparedness. \n \n ""This exercise was a resounding success and was not conducted in response to any specific, credible threat of a bioterrorism attack,"" said Tyler Q. Houlton, an agency spokesman. \n \n Juliette Kayyem, a former DHS official who now serves as a CNN contributor, said it was not surprising that the documents highlighted deficiencies. \n \n She said such exercises are designed to expose gaps in planning and preparedness so that authorities ""are better equipped if something bad were to happen."" \n \n Nonetheless, she said, the misplacement of the documents was ""a really stupid thing."" \n \n ""Who knows who else could have picked this up,"" she said. \n \n ""The biggest consequence of this mistake,"" Kayyem said, ""may have less to do with terrorists knowing our vulnerabilities and more to do with confidence in the Department of Homeland Security. In the end, confidence in the federal government at a time of crisis is what the American public deserves."" \n \n In addition to requesting that CNN not publish prior to the Super Bowl, DHS officials argued that disclosure of some material contained in the draft reports could threaten national security, regardless of when it was published. Based on that concern, CNN is withholding some details contained in the documents. \n \n The after-action reports obtained by CNN are based on a pair of exercises conducted as part of DHS\'s BioWatch program, which operates a nationwide aerosol detection system designed to provide an early warning of a biological attack across all levels of government. \n \n The exercises -- one in July, the other in early November — were built around the response to an intentional anthrax release that coincides with the Super Bowl. \n \n Among the findings was that there were ""differences of opinion"" over how many people had been exposed, ""which led to differences of opinion on courses of action."" \n \n The reports also noted there was confusion among local health agencies about the meaning of alerts issued during the exercise and with whom information could safely be shared during an emergency. \n \n This ""made it difficult for them to assess whether their city was at risk,"" the documents stated, and ""creates a situation where local officials are deciding on courses of action from limited points of view."" \n \n CNN was unable to verify who left the documents on the plane. The travel itinerary and boarding pass accompanying the documents was in the name of Michael V. Walter. \n \n Walter, a microbiologist, has been the program manager of BioWatch since 2009, according to his LinkedIn profile. \n \n ""I am responsible for developing and operating a budget that has ranged up to 90 million dollars and directed a staff or more than 50 members,"" his profile says. \n \n He held previous posts with the Central Intelligence Agency and Naval Surface Warfare Center and has 20 years of experience with biological warfare research. \n \n Walter, 59, did not respond to requests for comment for this article. \n \n A DHS official said the missing documents were the subject of an ""operational review"" and that ""DHS does not comment on personnel matters or potential pending personnel action."" \n \n There has been a drumbeat of criticism surrounding the BioWatch program since its inception in 2003. \n \n Multiple government reports issued over the course of more than a decade have raised questions about its cost and effectiveness. \n \n ""Since 2003, approximately $1 billion has been spent on this program,"" according to a 2013 memo by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce\'s oversight subcommittee. ""After more than a decade of operation, DHS still lacks crucial data demonstrating the effectiveness of the current technology."" \n \n The report also noted differences of opinion within the government about the program. \n \n ""Several statements by DHS about the performance of the BioWatch program are disputed by other government scientists or contradicted by information obtained in this investigation,"" the document said. \n \n A 2015 report by the Government Accountability Office struck a similar tone when it said ""considerable uncertainty"" exists about the types and sizes of biological attacks the system could detect. The report states that because DHS did not develop ""performance requirements"" for the program, the agency could not make informed decisions about how to upgrade it. \n \n An agency official noted in an email to CNN that ""Biodetection is one aspect of a layered approach to biodefense,"" and that ""DHS continues to develop requirements and field enhancements to our national biodefense.""']",2,"– Before you get off the plane, always check the seat-back pocket for your headphones, any magazines you might want, and those super-sensitive Homeland Security documents outlining how to protect Super Bowl attendees from an anthrax attack. One government scientist apparently didn't do so, as a CNN employee found out on a recent commercial flight, the network reports. The DHS paperwork, which was found along with a boarding pass and travel itinerary linked to a microbiologist and ex-CIA worker named Michael V. Walter, was marked ""for official use only"" and ""important for national security"" and detailed two exercises (one held last July, one in November) designed to gauge response from health and emergency management officials, as well as law enforcement, to a potential biological attack in Minneapolis on the day of the big game. Noteworthy in the report were calls for improvements in certain areas, which is the point of the exercises so that officials can fix any issues beforehand, per Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst who used to work for the DHS. Still, Kayyem notes leaving the documents on the plane was a ""really stupid thing,"" adding: ""Who knows who else could have picked this up."" It's not clear if Walter, who has headed up the agency's BioWatch program fighting bioterrorism for nearly a decade, was the one who left the documents on the plane. For national security reasons, government officials asked CNN to withhold certain details in the documents, as well as not to publish the story of the document gaffe until after the Super Bowl, which the network complied with. A DHS official would only say the incident is under ""operational review."""
"['She has played an Auschwitz survivor, a nuclear-reactor worker-turned- whistleblower, and the ruthless editor of a fashion magazine. Now Meryl Streep has been lined up to play the leading role in Thatcher, a biopic of one of the most controversial prime ministers in British history. \n \n The Oscar winner Jim Broadbent is tipped to play her husband Denis in the movie, which is being developed by Pathé and BBC films. \n \n The movie, set in the build-up to the Falklands conflict in 1982, will be directed by Phyllida Lloyd, who also helmed Mamma Mia!, the biggest-grossing British film of all time. Thatcher will be her second feature film and is likely to have considerably less singing and dancing than her debut. \n \n The potential casting of Streep has surprised the film world, though she has played an almost unrivalled range of roles. After the success of Mamma Mia! in 2008, she played a ruthless fashion magazine editor based on the British-born Vogue editor Anna Wintour in The Devil Wears Prada, perhaps the perfect preparation for the part. \n \n Ian Freer, the reviews editor at the film magazine Empire, said: ""Meryl Streep is the consummate film actress and can nail all kinds of emotional and dramatic colours, so she is the perfect choice. She delivered an impeccable English accent in The French Lieutenant\'s Woman and has played formidable women throughout her career. She will draw out the humanity in Margaret Thatcher – no mean feat."" \n \n The movie is set during the 17 days that preceded the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands and the ensuing 10-week war. As the storm brewed, Ms Thatcher\'s popularity was on the wane. Britain\'s triumph altered the public perception of her, and she won the 1983 election with a parliamentary majority of 144 – the most comprehensive of her election victories. However, it was the sinking of the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano, with the loss of 368 lives, that marked the most controversial moment of her career. \n \n Damian Jones will produce the film, fresh from the success of the Ian Dury biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll. The 61-year-old Streep will be slightly older than the Iron Lady she is playing: Thatcher was 56 when the Argentine president, General Galtieri, ordered the capture of the Falklands. \n \n Thatcher on screen \n \n Andrea Riseborough, \'The Long Road to Finchley\', 2008 \n \n ""Captures to perfection the fledgling leader\'s mannerisms and magnetism in a richly comic performance [which is] teasingly heavy on sexual allure.""

Timothy Dale Poole won $3 million on a Florida Lottery scratch-off ticket he purchased at a Mount Dora 7-Eleven store Saturday night. \n \n [VIDEO: Local 6\'s original report ] \n \n ""He was flabbergasted. He couldn\'t believe it,"" said Floyd Snyder, a friend who was with Poole when he hit the jackpot. ""It was quite a remarkable thing. My heart is still beating."" \n \n Poole was among the subjects of a recent Local 6 investigation that examined where convicted sex predators are employed. Poole is driver and dispatcher for Triangle Cab, a Mount Dora taxi company owned by his mother, records show. \n \n In 1999, Orange County authorities arrested Poole following allegations that he sexually battering a 9-year-old boy. According to an arrest warrant affidavit, Poole was a friend of the victim\'s family who once lived at their home. The victim also spent some weekends at Poole\'s home, according to investigators. \n \n ""He said Tim would sleep in the same bed as him at his house"" and perform a sex act on the child, the detective wrote in the affidavit. ""He said sometimes Tim would wake him up from sleeping to (perform a sex act)."" \n \n Poole denied the allegations, according to the report. \n \n As part of a plea bargain, Poole pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery and was sentenced to the 13 months he had already served in jail. The judge also ordered Poole to serve 10 years of sex offender probation and register as a sexual predator. A judge can designate someone as a predator if the defendant used physical violence, preyed on children or had repeat violations. \n \n In 2003, a judge revoked Poole\'s probation and sent him to prison for 3 years. According to court records, Poole was kicked out of his mandatory sex offender counseling because he failed to attend 4 group sessions. \n \n Poole, who has had no other legal troubles since being released from prison in 2006, insists he is innocent. \n \n ""It may be hard for some to believe, but sometimes people are wrongly accused,"" Poole told Local 6 in November. \n \n ""I\'ve known him for years and I\'ve never seen any inclination of anything like that with him,"" said Snyder, who believes his friend should enjoy the $3 million lottery jackpot. ""He\'s a very positive person. Very kind. Giving. I think that\'s why he won. It\'s Christmastime and the dude deserves a break."" \n \n Poole turned in his winning Super Millions scratch-off ticket at Florida Lottery headquarters in Tallahassee on Monday. Lottery officials said he chose to receive his winnings in a one-time, lump-sum payment of $2,219,807.90. \n \n Florida law does not allow the lottery to withhold payments from winners based on their criminal records, according to spokeswoman. However, before a winner receives a check, Florida Lottery officials conduct a background check using their Social Security number to ensure they do not owe child support or any outstanding debts to a state agency. \n \n Poole could not be reached for comment following his lottery win, so it is unclear what he plans to do with his millions. According to Snyder, Poole will be pouring some of that money into his mom\'s small taxi cab company. \n \n ""He\'s going to invest in the business,"" said Snyder. ""He\'s going to expand.""', 'At the Florida Lottery headquarters, Timothy Poole, 43, posed for a photo with an oversized check after claiming his $3 million Scratch-Off prize. But when the image hit the Internet, others recognized the 450-pound man as a registered sexual predator. \n \n In 2001, the Orange County Sheriff\'s Office arrested Poole on charges of sexual battery on a victim under 12, records show. Before that, he was arrested in 1991 for stealing almost $20,000 in food stamps from Safeco Inc. of Ocala, where he worked as a guard. \n \n In all, Poole has been arrested 12 times in Florida on charges ranging from grand theft to forging a check, records show. Poole served three months in prison in 1996 and did a second stint from 2003 to 2006, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. \n \n This week, Poole claimed his winnings from the Florida Lottery in a one-time lump-sum payment of $2,219,807.90. He played the Super Millions scratch-off game which costs $20 a ticket. The game offers 12 top prizes of $3 million and, with Poole\'s winner, five remain, spokeswoman Keri Gero said. \n \n A call to Poole\'s workplace, Triangle Cabs, was not returned.

The Florida Lottery cannot withhold earnings based on someone\'s criminal record. \n \n ""There are no registration laws that would prevent that, but if that offender was under supervision or on probation there could be additional sanctions imposed by the judge,"" said Samantha Andrews of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. \n \n Restrictions depend on the nature of the crime, Andrews said. For example, some sexual predators cannot dress up on Halloween because it attracts attention from children, she said. City or county ordinances may also prevent sexual predators from living within 1,000 feet of a school, day care or park. \n \n Poole pleaded guilty in 2002 to sexual battery of two boys. \n \n The incidents occurred in the late 1990s in both Tavares and Orlando, where he sometimes stayed with the boys\' parents, according to an Orange County sheriff\'s report. Poole, then 28, denied the allegations to sheriff\'s detectives, saying he would never hurt the boys because he felt as if they were his own. \n \n He was sentenced to five years in prison by Circuit Judge Alan S.

Poole—who now works as a driver for a taxi firm his mother owns—served 13 months on a plea deal for the 2001 offense and was later sent back to jail for three years after failing to attend mandatory sex offender counseling sessions. He was required to register as a sexual predator but continues to maintain his innocence and has had no legal problems since his release from prison in 2006, reports WKMG, which notes that Florida doesn't allow the lottery to withhold payments from winners based on their criminal records.

"['Stephen Colbert has technically colluded with Russia. \n \n The host of The Late Show went abroad to Saint Petersburg, where he met his Russian late-night TV host equivalent, Ivan Urgant, and appeared on his show, Evening Urgant. The pair threw back vodka shots, joked about Russian interference with the U.S. election, and mocked President Donald Trump. \n \n “I am so honored to be here right now because you are the No. 1 show here, and this is the state TV, so you’re officially an employee of the state and we agreed that I would appear here on the show,” Colbert told Urgant in front of his television audience. “We, uh, what’s the word for it? We colluded that I would be here on the show, and so I look forward to going back to America and testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee about colluding with Russians.” \n \n During an off-air chat with Colbert, Urgant described his show as more Jimmy Fallon than John Oliver. To that end, they played one of his games called Russian Russian Roulette. It wasn’t complicated: they each took turns spinning a turntable full of shot glasses until the arrow landed on one. They were all filled with vodka, so it proved to be the ultimate drinking game that guaranteed a buzz. \n \n Since this Russian government-approved television show would probably not be available in the U.S. — other than in Trump Tower, Urgant joked — Colbert took this opportunity to announce his bid for the 2020 presidential election. “I thought it would be great to cut out the middle man and tell the Russians myself: If anyone would like to work on my campaign in an unofficial capacity, please,” he joked. \n \n Watch Colbert’s trip to Russia’s Evening Urgant in the Late Show clip above.', '\'The Late Show\': Stephen Colbert Kicks Off ""Russia Week"" With New Footage From His Russian TV Debut \n \n The \'Late Show\' host\'s recent trip to the country will be broadcast in five new episodes starting July 17. \n \n Stephen Colbert kicked off day one of ""Russia Week"" on The Late Show with more jabs at Donald Trump Jr.\'s Russian ties and new footage of Colbert\'s recent trip to the country. \n \n ""I just want to get out ahead of the story here — I recently met with a lot of Russians.

""I didn\'t think you\'d find out; the whole week was supposed to be a secret. But someone leaked it to CBS\' marketing department,"" he said, then mouthed, ""I did."" \n \n Before diving into his Russia visit, Colbert took a moment to discuss what\'s been pervading the news cycle in the U.S.: Russia. \n \n The host once again tackled the topic of Trump Jr.\'s private meeting last year with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, who ""is reportedly a former Soviet counterintelligence officer."" \n \n ""Of course, when it comes to Don Jr. there\'s not much intelligence to counter,"" Colbert added. ""Here\'s the deal: Akhmetshin denies any current ties to Russian spy agencies, so you know it must be true. Remember the first rule of spy club: tell everyone you\'re in spy club."" \n \n Colbert also took aim at the White House\'s declaration of ""Made in America"" week, noting that the announcement was possibly made to distract from the fact that Trump\'s ""campaign was made in Russia."" \n \n Monday\'s episode of The Late Show broadcast the first few clips from Colbert\'s trip to Russia, during which he made a guest appearance on Russian talk show Evening Urgant and took to the streets of St. Petersburg to mingle with passersby. \n \n Colbert aired footage of his backstage chat with fellow talk show host Ivan Urgant about ""restrictions"" on what can and cannot be said on late-night TV in Russia. \n \n ""Do you talk about Trump on your show?

The CBS host launched ""Russia Week"" on Monday night following his visit to the country, per the Hollywood Reporter. Colbert will be airing pieces from his trip all week, and his first was on his visit to a Colbert-like figure in Russia, TV host Ivan Urgant. Colbert appeared on Urgant's Russian show, where he mocked Trump, drank vodka, and announced his own supposed bid for the White House in 2020. ""I thought it would just be better to cut out the middle man and just tell the Russians myself: If anyone would like to work on my campaign in an unofficial capacity, please, just let me know,"" he said, per Entertainment Weekly. (See the video here.) His monologue, meanwhile, focused on the travails of Donald Trump Jr. At one point, he made reference to reports of how the number of people in attendance at last year's now-famous meeting continues to grow. ""This is the first time a Trump has lied about having a smaller crowd size,"" he said. (See that here.)"
"['Story highlights The CIA officially acknowledges Area 51, long a fixation for conspiracy theorists, in documents \n \n The area, 125 northwest of Las Vegas, was a testing ground for Cold War aerial surveillance \n \n Document release could be just the beginning of Area 51 information, expert says \n \n Area 51 has long been a topic of fascination for conspiracy theorists and paranormal enthusiasts, but newly released CIA documents officially acknowledge the site and suggest that the area served a far less remarkable purpose than many had supposed. \n \n According to these reports, which include a map of the base\'s location in Nevada, Area 51 was merely a testing site for the government\'s U-2 and OXCART aerial surveillance programs. The U-2 program conducted surveillance around the world, including over the Soviet Union during the Cold War. \n \n Area 51, about 125 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is synonymous in popular culture with government secrecy, and many have theorized that it holds the answer to one of the greatest questions plaguing mankind: Are we really alone in the universe? \n \n But the newly released documents make no mention of alien autopsy rooms or spaceship parking lots. \n \n This information will be disappointing to some, who have come to view the area as a mecca of sorts for alien encounters. \n \n For these true believers, the existence of alien spacecraft at Area 51, and the government\'s attempts to cover up their trace, is irrefutable and has been since reports of Unidentified Flying Objects -- or UFOs -- began to emerge from the Nevada desert in the middle part of the 20th century. \n \n The map and other documents were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archives, in 2005. \n \n The map and other documents were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archives. \n \n Richelson submitted the request as part of his continuing study of aerial surveillance programs and told CNN that he was not given an explanation of why the new documents were less redacted than previous versions declassified by the agency. \n \n JUST WATCHED Area 51 Revealed Replay More Videos ...

Its location appears in books on aerial surveillance and is widely referenced in popular culture. \n \n In fact, the map that was released in the CIA documents mirrors the one that appears after a simple Google Maps search for ""Area 51."" \n \n Area 51 has also been referenced in government documents in the past, though this newest release is the first that acknowledges its existence and location in a purposeful way. \n \n Richelson told CNN he believes this could signal a dramatic change in the government\'s willingness to declassify information about the famed base, meaning even more information could come out about Area 51 in the future. \n \n The release of these reports seem to put the theories about aliens and flying saucers to rest for the time being, although they may not be enough to silence the true believers. \n \n At least they still have Roswell, right?', 'WASHINGTON — Newly declassified government documents made public Thursday are shedding some of the official mystery surrounding Nevada’s role in developing spy planes of the Cold War. \n \n A history of the U-2 reconnaissance program written by CIA officials in 1992 and released this summer to a national security institute contains official acknowledgement and several mentions of Area 51, the remote desert base 90 miles north of Las Vegas that the government once denied even existed. \n \n It includes the story of when CIA project director Richard Bissell and Air Force officer Col. Osmund Ritland in April 1955 first flew over an old airstrip by the salt flat named Groom Lake. The Beechcraft plane was piloted by Tony LeVier, Lockheed’s chief test pilot. \n \n On closer inspection they agreed it “would make an ideal site for testing the U-2 and training its pilots,” according to the history. The lightweight aircraft was being built by Lockheed at its highly secure “Skunk Works” plant in Burbank, Calif. \n \n Allen Dulles, the director of Central Intelligence, and Adm. Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, got President Dwight Eisnenhower to sign off on adding the strip, “known by its map designation as Area 51,” to what was then called the Nevada Test Site. \n \n “To make the facility in the middle of nowhere sound more attractive to his workers, (Skunk Works founder) Kelly Johnson called it the Paradise Ranch, which was soon shortened to the Ranch,” according to the document. \n \n Three months later, by July 1955, “the base was ready and Agency, Air Force and Lockheed personnel began moving in.” \n \n On July 25, the first prototype was delivered, wrapped in tarpaulins, “its long slender wings and tail assembly removed.” It was flown to Groom Lake aboard a C-124, and mechanics spent six days readying the craft for its first flight on Aug. 4. \n \n Subsequent high-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect, “a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects” that added much to Area 51 lore. \n \n That the Nevada installation was a development and staging area for the high-altitude spy plane and other aircraft that flew secret missions over the Soviet Union, China and other U.S. targets now is commonly known, having previously been revealed in several histories of the era. \n \n But up to now, mentions of the base in officially released documents were rare and “probably inadvertent,” said Jeffrey Richelson, senior fellow of the National Security Archive, a research institute that contains a major library of declassified U.S. documents. \n \n Releasing information on Area 51 now “is clearly a conscious decision to acknowledge the name, the location rather than play pretend about the secrecy,” Richelson said. \n \n The 407-page history, “The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance,” was released to Richelson in June in response to a Freedom of Information Act request he filed in 2005. A heavily redacted version was published in 1998. \n \n The history also discusses the site’s role in Oxcart, the CIA code-named program that produced the Lockheed A-12 spy plane, the nation’s first stealth aircraft. \n \n T.D. Barnes, 75, of Henderson and Roger Andersen, 83, of Las Vegas, both worked on development of the A-12 at Area 51 in the 1960s. \n \n “There’s not much really new here but they are officially confirming what has been previously speculated,” said Barnes, who worked on a radar project in Beatty that measured the velocity of the record-breaking, rocket-powered X-15 in 1964. \n \n “We would secretly track the flights for the CIA,” he said. \n \n A CIA contractor, Barnes arrived at Area 51 in 1968 as a radar expert to put the finishing touches on the A-12. He said most of the CIA’s “black operations” in Nevada used code names for the projects but not the facility. \n \n He said other unofficial names used for the facility include Dreamland, Home Base, Watertown Strip, Groom Lake and Homey Airport. \n \n “The U-2 guys called it Watertown because that was the hometown of the CIA director at the time,” Barnes said, referring to Dulles. \n \n Barnes said Area 51 is part of the Nellis Air Force range operations area. The restricted airspace around it is known by military pilots as “the box” or “the container.” \n \n Andersen, an Air Force captain recruited by the CIA, said the stories behind Area 51 “generally were known by those of us who worked there but not to the rest of the world.” \n \n While the CIA had been protective of Area 51 information for so long, Andersen said he sensed a shift within the past five to seven years. As a result, he and former Area 51 personnel were invited to a CIA “family day” at headquarters in Langley, Va. \n \n Richelson, the National Security Archive senior fellow, said he had no idea why the CIA decided to open up on Area 51 at this time. Researchers hope it is a sign the agency might be forthcoming about details of other once-secret Nevada programs, such as development of the F-117 Stealth jet and the use of captured Soviet MiGs to train U.S. pilots in air-to-air combat.']",2,"– It's a milestone of sorts for conspiracy theorists: The CIA has for the first time declassified documents that detail the existence of Area 51 in Nevada, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The documents, obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request by a national security institute at George Washington University, explain that Area 51 got its start in 1955 because the government needed a place to test U-2 spy planes. Aliens in crashed spaceships are nowhere to be found in the documents. But here's one weird detail that is: The government initially called it ""Paradise Ranch"" to make the ""facility in the middle of nowhere"" sound more alluring to workers. The documents include a CIA map of the site, which is pretty much the same one that has long been available in a Google Maps search for ""Area 51,"" notes CNN. So what's the big deal here? It's ""clearly a conscious decision to acknowledge the name, the location rather than play pretend about the secrecy,” says the researcher who filed the FOIA request, Jeffrey Richelson. It should pave the way for the release of even more information about the site, he adds. You can dig into the 400 pages of documents here."
"['It’s a cold snap life for penguins up in Alberta, Canada. \n \n Not only did the Calgary Zoo have to cancel its Zoo Lights holiday event on Dec. 30 and Dec. 31 due to frigid temperatures, but the staff also decided to bring its penguin flock inside rather than subject the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic birds to the -28 C (feels like -40 C with the wind chill!) weather. The zoo follows a guideline whereby zookeepers bring the birds inside when the temp falls below -25 C. \n \n According to CTVNews, the zoo has 51 members in its flock, which represents a variety of species. In the wild, king penguins often dwell in sub-Antarctic regions, but they are more accustomed to milder climates than their Antarctic cousins, the emperor penguins. \n \n “We just don’t want to expose them to too much,” Malu Celli, the zoo’s curator, told CTVNews on Sunday. “To keep them safe, we decided to pick a limit to let them out.” \n \n Celli went on to say that “It’s not necessarily that it’s too cold for them … I believe that physiologically, they can withstand colder weather than what we have here, but these are not wild birds.” \n \n In fact, the king penguins have a chick among the flock (see “Cleopatra,” below) who is still maturing, so the zookeepers decided to err on the side of safety. \n \n All species of penguins have a layer of insulating fat, as well as down feathers that help them keep warm. Plus, the tuxedoed birds tend to huddle together to create warmth while conserving heat by keeping their flippers close at their sides. That said, the Calgary Zoo’s penguins, who hail from several regions of the world, would probably be more than happy to waddle around in the frigid cold open air. \n \n “It’s kind of like you can bundle up your kid, but then there’s a point you’re going to say, ‘I know you’re good, but I’d rather you stay inside now,’ ” Celli told CTVNews. \n \n (Below, see the penguins roaming outside during the summer months at the zoo.) \n \n Luckily, there’s good news for the fresh air-loving members of the Calgary Zoo penguin flock in 2018: A media representative at the zoo tells PEOPLE that although “the king penguins moved indoors when the temps plummeted … the weather has since become much milder … so this is no longer an issue.” \n \n The recent frigid weather also resulted in cancellations of New Year polar bear dips and plunges throughout Canada.', 'CLOSE Bone-chilling cold gripped much of the U.S. as 2018 began, breaking century-old records and leading to several deaths that authorities attributed to exposure to the dangerously low temperatures.

As temperatures continue to drop, here are some things you shouldn\'t leave in your car: \n \n Cellphones \n \n Apple advises against storing the iPhone or iPad at temperatures below negative-4 degrees, and they shouldn\'t be operated at temperatures lower than 32 degrees. There are similar recommendations for Samsung phones and other electronics. Lithium-ion batteries popular in cellphones are the most vulnerable component to cold, USA TODAY reports. They can stop working in extreme cold but should be OK once you get back indoors. However, repeated exposure to subzero temperatures can cause problems. \n \n More: Let it snow — maybe even in Florida as cold wave tightens grip on USA \n \n Soda or beer \n \n Water expands when it freezes. And for canned liquids under pressure, that can mean explosion. The freeze temperature for Coca-Cola is 30 degrees, and the temperature for beer that\'s 5% alcohol by volume is 27 degrees (higher-alcohol beers freeze at lower temperatures), as NJ.com reported. \n \n We put a bunch of cans of soda in an old station car in the frigid cold and waited for them to explode. Nearly 24 hours later... pic.twitter.com/0LhKnZvYGL — Darnay Tripp (@DarnayTripp) January 7, 2017 \n \n Musical instruments \n \n Things contract when they freeze, so this can cause some instruments to go out of tune. More seriously, ""damage can be done when an instrument shrinks as a result of the cold air. If your instrument is made of real wood, the cold air can cause cracking, which is very expensive to repair. Sometimes they are broken beyond repair,"" according to The Real School of Music. If an instrument is left in a freezing car for a long period, try to make it warm up gradually. \n \n Eggs \n \n Eggs shouldn\'t be allowed to freeze in their shells; if that happens, throw away any cracked eggs. Keep the un-cracked ones frozen, and move them to the refrigerator before use. ""These can be hard cooked successfully, but other uses may be limited. That\'s because freezing causes the yolk to become thick and syrupy so it will not flow like an unfrozen yolk or blend very well with the egg white or other ingredients,"" according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service. \n \n Canned foods \n \n Letting a can of beans freeze allows for the water to freeze and expand in a similar way to beer and soda. The USDA advises that this can result in a broken seal, causing spoilage. If canned food freezes, allow it to thaw in a refrigerator. ""If the product doesn\'t look and/or smell normal, throw it out. DO NOT TASTE IT! If the seams have rusted or burst, throw the cans out immediately, wrapping the burst can in plastic and disposing the food where no one, including animals can get it,"" according to the USDA. \n \n Medication \n \n If you\'re visiting a pharmacy during the deep freeze, consider that some medications can be affected by low temperatures. ""Drugs like insulin can lose their effectiveness if they freeze. The same goes for any so-called suspended medication that has to be shaken before use,"" according to a report in The New York Times. \n \n Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE BABY, IT\'S COLD OUTSIDE N.C. officials urge people to stay home | 0:46 Even after the storm blew off shore, North Carolina officials urged people to stay home while crews worked on roads made treacherous by the storm.

We are going to strengthen our borders even more,” he wrote in a tweet, without elaborating on his plans. “Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n A gunman opened fire Tuesday at an outdoor Christmas market in Strasbourg, France, near the border with Germany. Although he has not been apprehended, the Strasbourg-born gunman was known to authorities before the shooting, which French officials have said is “probably” terrorism-related. \n \n Trump met Tuesday with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi over his $5 billion request for funding to build the border wall, a sit-down that quickly deteriorated into a partisan brawl on live television, culminating with Trump’s declaration that he would be “proud” to force a partial government shutdown if his demands were not met. \n \n Playbook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. \n \n While lawmakers in the Senate have agreed to a bipartisan deal that would provide $1.6 billion for border security, none of those taxpayer dollars would be allowed to fund a wall, but only fencing and other resources. Trump has upped his request to $5 billion for his long-promised wall and is not backing down, boasting Tuesday that “I don’t mind owning that issue.” \n \n Though the legislative and executive branches of the government are under Republican control, any spending bill will need 60 votes in the Senate, meaning some Democratic support is required. \n \n Schumer and Pelosi said Tuesday they had pitched the president either a yearlong stopgap for the Department of Homeland Security, freezing its funding at current levels, or a yearlong continuing resolution for the remaining spending bills Congress has yet to consider. Either option would deny Trump a proposed $300 million boost for border security but would keep the government open as negotiations continued. \n \n Trump also sought to tie his demands for border security to the Obama administration’s Iran nuclear deal, a pact his administration withdrew from earlier this year, falsely claiming in another tweet that “the Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?” \n \n The president appears to refer to dubious claims by opponents of the deal that lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbing its nuclear weapons programs freed up $150 billion in frozen assets for the country, a far cry from the $56 billion estimated by then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and the $25 billion to $50 billion estimated by some experts. That money is in a separate category because it never belonged to U.S. taxpayers, unlike border wall funding appropriated by Congress."", 'Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Learn more']",3,"– President Trump's Oval Office argument with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi was the talk of the town on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the president picked up where he left off. Trump took to Twitter to continue his push for border-wall funding, this time trying to bolster his argument by citing a mass shooting Tuesday at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France. Politico notes the attack was located near the France-Germany border. Trump tweeted, ""Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!"" Then, in a second tweet, ""The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?"" Senators are currently willing to approve $1.6 billion in funding for border security, though that money couldn't be put toward wall construction. As for Trump's $150 billion figure, it's a reference to the amount of frozen assets Iran got access to when sanctions were lifted as part of the nuclear deal; Politico reports then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew calculated a lower impact of $56 billion. (The suspect in the Strasbourg attack may have already fled France.)"

""Jordan was failed by the system."" \n \n During a news conference Wednesday morning, Largo Police Lt. Randall Chaney confirmed the charges and added multiple details of the case. \n \n Chaney said Stinson acted alone in the boy\'s death and there was no one else involved.

Shortly after, they made a short announcement confirming they had found the boy\'s body. \n \n In an exclusive interview with Spectrum News conducted earlier Tuesday, Stinson, who did not want to be on camera, maintained her story that Jordan was abducted. \n \n ""There\'s a lot of concern because my son, we have DCF involved, but it is not towards me being a horrible parent or anything like that,"" Stinson said. ""And I just really want people to know that I am a good mom. I am a good mother.

She claimed that the man, named Antwan, attacked her and beat her unconscious. When she woke up in Largo Central Park, Jordan was gone, she said. \n \n The story though was all a lie according to police, who added that Stinson\'s wounds were self-inflicted. \n \n According to a police report, Stinson became upset with Jordan and struck the child across the face with the back of her hand. Police say the back of his head then hit a wall causing severe injuries. \n \n He suffered seizures throughout the night, until he eventually died, authorities said. Police said Stinson then took the body to the wooded area and left the boy there. \n \n Authorities said Jordan spent the majority of his life in foster care. He was taken away from Stinson at 3 months old, but she regained custody in May. \n \n Police reports dating back to July of this year show a history of domestic violence between Jordan \'s parents. \n \n Also, Stinson is pregnant and due to give birth in December. It is not known who the father is. \n \n An investigation is ongoing but police did say that it remains unknown if this weekend\'s discovery of bloody items at Stinson\'s apartment is related to the child\'s death. \n \n Spectrum Bay News 9 reporter Dave Jordan contributed to this report.', '- Law enforcement officials announced Tuesday night they arrested the mother of a toddler whose body was found in a wooded area in Pinellas County. \n \n The 2-year-old went missing over the weekend - and was the subject of an Amber Alert and massive search of the Largo area. \n \n Largo police announced early Tuesday evening Jordan Belliveau had been found, but did not say if he was alive.

Four hours later, she told police she regained consciousness in Largo Central Park and her son was missing. \n \n She told police she accepted the ride because she had a long walk ahead of her and Jordan was becoming too heavy to carry. \n \n The Florida Department of Law Enforcement issued an Amber Alert Sunday. Family members and volunteers climbed through bushes and scoured Largo Central Park Monday, searching for any sign of Jordan. \n \n Police also released a sketch of Antwan, who was described as having dreadlocks and gold teeth. \n \n ""I just want everybody in the community to keep ahold of your kids. Don’t get in strange cars. I’m glad we got justice. I’m not sure if it’s Antwan, if that even exists, but if he [does], I hope he gets justice,” Davis said. \n \n However, police said Antwan does not appear to exist. \n \n Earlier Tuesday, Largo police released a video of a man at a 7-Eleven on East Bay Drive who they say may have spoken with Jordan\'s mother just after midnight Sunday.

"['(CNN) Your favorite fitness tracker may not be totally accurate, according to a study used in an amended complaint filed Thursday against Fitbit. \n \n The class-action lawsuit, filed earlier this year, argues that the PurePulse technology used in the Fitbit trackers that measure your heart rate doesn\'t do it as well as the company\'s marketing material promises, a claim Fitbit denies. The technology is used in the more expensive models of the device, the Surge, Blaze and Charge HR. \n \n The lawsuit was filed on behalf of people who bought these Fitbits specially to help them track their heart rate, whether for health reasons or to make sure they are getting the most out of their workouts. \n \n ""We are not arguing that it is a medical device. I think that is irrelevant,"" said Jonathan Selbin , one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit. ""This is about the way they market it and that they charge a premium for the heart rate monitor, but it\'s not giving a meaningful measurement."" \n \n The suit alleges that a defect in the trackers is a safety hazard because people who rely on inaccurate heart rate readings for medical purposes could be at risk. The class-action members say there is no reasonable way for them to know that the devices can be inaccurate and that they might not have even bought them if they knew. \n \n The amended complaint, filed Thursday, added a new study that looked at how the trackers worked for 43 healthy adults, compared with an ECG and against each other. The participants wore two Fitbits during the test. \n \n The study -- which was funded by the legal team that brought the lawsuit -- found that the devices were off by, on average, 20 beats per minute during moderate- to high-intensity exercise. The lawsuit concludes that the ""devices could not provide meaningful heart rate data"" when someone is exercising. \n \n ""It works pretty well when you are resting,"" study co-author Edward Jo said. But Fitbit is ""advertised to people who exercise,"" and ads suggest that the trackers are ""counting every beat."" \n \n Researchers tested the device on 22 men and 21 women, who were observed in a single visit. They wore the devices, a Zephyr Technology BioHarness and a single-channel ECG sensor. Monitored for 65 minutes, the subjects were asked to perform physical activities that were similar to ones represented in the Fitbit ads, including a standing rest, a self-paced jog, jumping rope, climbing stairs, fast movement exercise, treadmill running and a seated rest. \n \n The research was done by Jo and Brett Dolezal, scientists at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. \n \n Fitbit objects to the study, suggesting that it ""lacks scientific rigor and is the product of flawed methodology."" \n \n According to a statement from a Fitbit representative, ""It was paid for by plaintiffs\' lawyers who are suing Fitbit, and was conducted with a consumer-grade electrocardiogram -- not a true clinical device, as implied by the plaintiffs\' lawyers.

Fitbit Charge HR is the #1 selling fitness tracker on the market, and is embraced by millions of consumers around the globe."" \n \n Fitbit also cites an independent study by Consumer Reports in which it did its own tests and found the heart rate measurements to be accurate.

The device relies in part on a change in motion, and for the motion pattern to recognize a step, it must be large enoug h. Pushing a cart or even walking on a soft surface like a plush carpet may undercount your movement. It can also overcount your steps if you are riding on a bumpy road, according to Fitbit\'s website. \n \n Montoye said for participants who need to track their heart rate he advises using a different device that is more specific. \n \n Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n ""If they had just been honest,"" Selbin said, ""and said it can give you a ballpark figure most of the time, or if the marketing emphasized that you can use these when you are aspiring to be healthier, that would have been OK, but that\'s not how they market it, and they charge a premium for it.""', 'SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The following statement is being issued by Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP: \n \n A comprehensive new study conducted by researchers at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (“Cal Poly Pomona”) reveals that the PurePulse™ heart rate monitors in the Fitbit Surge™ and Charge HR™ bear an “extremely weak correlation” with actual users’ heart rates as measured by a true echocardiogram (ECG) and are “highly inaccurate during elevated physical activity.” \n \n With this study, Dr. Brett Dolezal and Dr. Edward Jo set out to test the accuracy of the Fitbit heart rate monitoring devices and to determine once and for all whether they were statistically valid heart rate monitors. It is the most thorough examination of the Fitbit heart rate monitors performed to date, and includes results from 43 separate subjects tested for 65 minutes each during a variety of activities depicted by Fitbit when marketing the devices such as jogging, stair climbing, jumping rope, and plyometrics. While performing these activities, each subject wore a Fitbit heart rate device on different wrists, which were measured against a time-synchronized ECG, the gold standard of heart rate monitoring. \n \n Jonathan Selbin of Lieff Cabraser stated: “We commissioned this comprehensive, peer-review quality study by academics with expertise in this area to further test our allegations, and it proved them to be true. These devices simply are not accurate at measuring heart rates during moderate or high intensity exercise.” Co-counsel, and former Assistant to the United States Solicitor General, Robert Klonoff added: “We are unaware of any comprehensive testing performed by Fitbit prior to releasing the Fitbit devices with the PurePulse™ technology or since.” \n \n After carefully analyzing the more than 46 hours’ worth of comparative data—including hundreds of thousands of individual data points—that resulted from this testing, Dr. Jo and Dr. Dolezal concluded that the Fitbit devices simply do not accurately track users’ actual heart rates, particularly during exercise. At moderate to high exercise intensities, the average difference between the Fitbit devices and the ECG was approximately 20 beats per minute, well beyond any reasonable or expected margin of error. Moreover, this analysis disregards the thousands of discrete data points in which the Fitbit devices recorded literally no heart beat at all. As the authors note, incorporating those null data points increased the average discrepancy at moderate to high intensities to approximately 25 beats per minute, an even worse result. In addition, the study also reported a ""startling inconsistency"" between Fitbit devices simultaneously recording the same user’s heart rate on different wrists. \n \n The report concludes: “Overall, the results of this investigation fail to support Fitbit® Surge™ and Charge HR™ wearable fitness trackers and the integrated PurePulse™ technology as valid methods for heart rate measurement.” In other words, “[t]he PurePulse Trackers do not accurately measure a user’s heart rate, particularly during moderate to high intensity exercise, and cannot be used to provide a meaningful estimate of a user’s heart rate.” \n \n Although this is the by far the most comprehensive study of the devices’ accuracy, it is not the first. The data from the Cal Poly Pomona study corresponds closely with results obtained in February 2016 by researchers at Ball State University in Indiana (available at http://www.wthr.com/story/31285468/sometimes-your-fitness-tracker-lies-a-lot-fitbit-jawbone-garmin-ifit-misfit-accuracy), in an unrelated and independent study. They too found that the Fitbit heart rate devices were off by “20 or 30 beats per minute,” a margin of error they concluded was unacceptably high and “dangerous – especially for people at high risk of heart disease.” As that report put it, “The box for the Fitbit Charge HR says ‘every beat counts,’ but despite what the package says, the tracking device inside missed lots of them.” \n \n The new study was included in an amended complaint filed in the consumer fraud class action case filed earlier this year by several purchasers represented by attorneys at Lieff Cabraser and co-counsel against Fitbit, Inc., over complaints that various Fitbit heart rate monitors—now including three Fitbit models equipped with the PurePulse™ technology, the Fitbit Blaze™, Fitbit Charge HR™ and the Fitbit Surge™—fail to accurately measure user heart rates during exercise, the precise use for which Fitbit markets them and for which it charges a premium price. \n \n Consumer Protection Attorneys at Lieff Cabraser \n \n If you purchased a Fitbit Heart Rate Monitor (Fitbit Charge HR™, Blaze™, or Surge™), we invite you to visit our Fitbit Heart Rate Monitor lawsuit page to contact a consumer attorney at Lieff Cabraser.

In a press release, plaintiffs' lawyers say California State Polytechnic University put both Fitbits and ECG sensors on 43 separate subjects tested for 65 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise, and found that the PurePulse technology in the Fitbits had an ""extremely weak correlation"" with the heart rate recorded by the ECGs. The researchers say the Fitbit measurement was up to 20 beats per minute off during exercise. In some cases, Fitbits on both wrists recorded different rates—and heart rates of zero were recorded on subjects who were definitely not zombies. Fitbit argues that the study, which was funded by the lawyers, ""lacks scientific rigor and is the product of flawed methodology."" The company notes that the ECGs were consumer-grade ones, not clinical devices. Alex Montoye, an assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology at Ball State University tells CNN that his own research has found that Fitbits are pretty good at giving a ""ballpark estimate of activity levels, but these are difficult elements to measure perfectly."" He says the Fitbit is not a medical device and doesn't claim to be one, which is why the company tends to use words like ""track"" instead of ""measure"" in marketing materials and never promises 100% accuracy. (Doctors say heart rate data from this man's Fitbit helped save his life.)"
"['In a fitting finale to a week Tesla Motors executives would rather forget, a law firm announced Friday that it had filed a class-action suit against the electric car maker for allegedly misleading investors over the fire risk posed by the company’s Model S sedan. \n \n The firm of Pomerantz Grossman Hufford Dahlstrom & Gross accused Tesla of making misleading statements about the car’s safety, in spite of “undisclosed puncture and fire risks” that the law firm attributes to “material defects” in the Model S battery pack. \n \n On Wednesday, a Model S caught fire on a Tennessee freeway after striking a metal towing hitch lying in the road. The hitch punctured the electric car’s battery pack, which lies beneath the floorboards and is protected from the road by a steel shield. It was the third Model S fire in six weeks, and it helped drive down the company’s stock. \n \n Reviewers have given the Model S high marks for safety, and the car scored higher on tests from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration than any other U.S. vehicle. But the new suit alleges that the car “suffered from material defects which caused the battery pack to ignite and erupt in flames under certain driving conditions.” \n \n The first Model S fire, on October 1, happened after a driver on a freeway outside Seattle struck a curved piece of metal, which punched through the plate protecting the battery pack. The second fire, which happened in Mexico, involved a driver racing through a roundabout, striking two walls and finally hitting a tree. \n \n Pomerantz seeks to represent shareholders who bought Tesla stock between May 10 of this year and Nov. 6, the day of the third fire. May 10 roughly marked the start of a spectacular run-up in Tesla’s share price. The stock closed May 10 at $76.76 and peaked in late September at $193.37. It closed Friday at $137.95. \n \n Tesla, based in Palo Alto, declined comment on the suit Friday. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. \n \n Pomerantz specializes in corporate, securities and antitrust suits. The firm on Friday also sued J.C. Penney, claiming the retailer tried to hide its shaky finances from investors. \n \n — David R. Baker', 'With reports of car fires and other bad news driving the price of Tesla Motors shares down 30% from its all time high reached almost six weeks ago, is this the time to start buying into the electric car company? \n \n Not yet, said Efraim Levy, a S&P Capital IQ equity analyst. Levy is maintaining his sell recommendation even though the shares are trading at $135.57 Friday morning, down about 4% from Thursday\'s close and below his $140 target price. \n \n “People are watching like hawks for anything to happen to this company,” Levy said. “There is such intense scrutiny.” \n \n Tesla, which for most of the year has been one of Wall Street’s best performing stocks, has faced brisk head winds this week. \n \n On Thursday the automaker confirmed that a fire burned up one of its $70,000-plus Model S hatchbacks. It was the third such incident in five weeks and triggered calls for a federal safety investigation. \n \n ""There is no question that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should start looking at this,"" said Clarence Ditlow, executive director for the Center for Auto Safety. \n \n Meanwhile, car shopping website and auto reviewer Edmunds.com said its has encountered mechanical problems in its Tesla that have forced the replacement of numerous parts, including the entire drivetrain. \n \n A battery supply bottleneck, heavy research and development spending and declining sales of lucrative environmental credits also have created head winds for the Palo Alto automaker. \n \n Earlier in the week Tesla said it lost $38.5 million, or 32 cents a share, in the third quarter. That compares with a loss of $110.8 million, or $1.05 a share, in the same period last year. \n \n “Headlines of fire are never good from a marketing perspective,” Levy said. \n \n He noted that all three incidents were triggered by accidents rather than an internal issue with the vehicles. Levy said that once an automaker starts to have thousands of cars on the road – Tesla has sold almost 17,000 cars in the U.S. this year – fires and other incidents are bound to happen. \n \n Levy still believes that Tesla is an innovative automaker that is carving out a strong brand and that it makes sense to value the company more like a technology company and growth story rather than a mature automaker. \n \n “But if there are more fires the stock won’t be so hot,” Levy said. \n \n Follow me on Twitter (@LATimesJerry), Facebook and Google+. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Consumer Reports cuts Camry from picks list \n \n White is the new white. Popularity as car color grows \n \n What\'s behind Toyota settlement of sudden acceleration lawsuit']",2,"– Headlines about cars starting on fire tend to do bad things to said car company's stock prices, and investors in Tesla have gotten angry enough to sue. A class-action suit announced yesterday accuses the company of misleading investors on safety issues, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The suit follows a Model S fire on Wednesday in Tennessee, the third such fire in six weeks. The latest happened when the driver ran over a tow hitch, which punctured the electric car's battery pack. The suit says the vehicle “suffered from material defects which caused the battery pack to ignite and erupt in flames under certain driving conditions.” It seeks to cover anyone who bought stock from May 10 through Wednesday. In that span, Tesla stock went from $77 to a peak of $193 in September to its close of $138 on Friday. Of course, with the stock dropping, a Los Angeles Times article raises the question, Is it a good time to buy? The short answer from one analyst is not yet. As more Teslas hit the road and presumably get involved in more accidents, it's likely we're going to be reading about more fires until a fix is in place."

Only after news reports in mid-2010 began to describe the dubious practices, like the routine filing of false pleadings in bankruptcy courts, did Fannie Mae’s overseer start to scrutinize the conduct. The report was critical of that overseer, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and was prepared by the agency’s inspector general. In one notable lapse, even after the agency reported problems to Fannie Mae in late 2010 about some of the approved law firms, it did not request a response from the company, the report said.” http://nyti.ms/rtbq9M \n \n \n \n ** A message from the Investment Company Institute: Over almost 40 years, money market funds have emerged as a steady, predictable mainstay of the financial marketplace and a key component of the American economy.

As you might imagine, most on the economy. And a lot of anger out there. There\'s so many people who simply don\'t think they\'re better off than they were four years ago. How do you convince them that they are? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I don\'t think they\'re better off than they were four years ago. They\'re not better off than they were before Lehman\'s collapse, before the financial crisis-- before this extraordinary recession we\'re going through. I think that-- what we\'ve seen is that we\'ve been able to make steady progress to stabilize the economy. But the unemployment rate is still way too high. And that\'s why it\'s so critical for us to make sure that we are taking every action we can take to put people back to work. And the American Jobs Act, the bill that I put before Congress three weeks ago puts construction workers back to work rebuilding our roads and bridges, it puts teachers back in the classroom, teaching our kids, makes sure that veterans-- are getting a break-- if they come home and are looking for a job with a small business, provides everybody a tax cut, small businesses and middle class families alike so that we\'ve got more consumers out there with a little more confidence, a little more money in their pockets. You know, these are ideas that historically have been supported by Democrats and Republicans. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: As you might have heard in the last hour, the Republican leader in the house, Eric Cantor, said he\'s not going to schedule a clean bill-- this all or nothing approach, he said, is unreasonable. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, look, what he needs to do is to tell us what exactly he\'s for. Because what I\'ve done is put forward what economists say can increase our growth by close to two percent and put 1.9 million people-- ultimately back to work. Now if he\'s got other ideas, we\'re happy to look at those other ideas. But what-- what I think the American people cannot abide by is us doing nothing. We can\'t sit here and pretend that somehow-- you know, Washington just cutting spending, in and of itself, is going to be putting people back to work. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: ...pass the tax cuts and the trade bills, is that enough? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, we\'re going to be passing the trade bills. And I\'m pleased we\'re doing that. Because that actually will add jobs-- you know, the trade bill not only is for Korea, but also Panama and Colombia. All these countries, right now, are able to sell into the United States. We have one of the most open markets in the world. Theirs are still a little too closed. And as I\'ve said before, I want-- I don\'t mind Kias and Hyundais sold here, as long as Chryslers and-- and Fords are being sold-- in Korea, as well. So I\'m glad that\'s an area of bipartisan agreement, but it\'s not enough by itself. There\'s more that we can do. And, you know, for example, you talk to Republican governors, Republican mayors, and they\'ll tell you that the need for them to rebuild roads and bridges, including some-- you know, that-- I visited in-- in-- in Virginia, but also-- some that I\'ve visited-- between Kentucky and Ohio, where-- both-- Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell hail from-- those are projects that need to happen anyway. Why not do them now at a time when we\'ve got construction workers out of work, contractors-- are able to come in under budget, on time. This is the time to do it. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: We have a brand new poll out at ABC. It\'s just coming out-- later today, showing the majority of Americans, 55 percent, think you\'ll be a one-term president. Are you the underdog now? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Absolutely. The-- because-- you know, given the economy, there\'s no doubt that, you know, whatever happens on your watch, you\'ve got-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You embraced that pretty quickly. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You-- you-- you know, I-- I don\'t mind. I-- I\'m used to being an underdog. And-- and I think that-- at the end of the day, though, what people are going to say is, ""Who\'s got a vision for the future? That can actually help ordinary families recapture that American dream?"" When I ran in 2008, the basic idea was that-- you know, ordinary folks, who are working hard, you know, doing everything right, just weren\'t getting ahead. Wages, incomes had flat-lined, costs were going up, everything from health care to college education. And-- you know, the whole approach of everything I\'ve tried to do over the last three years is to say, ""What are those big changes that we have to make so that our kids are getting the best education, we\'ve got the best infrastructure in the world, we\'ve got the tools that allow us to succeed again?"" \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: We actually got a great question on Twitter about 2008. It\'s from Gale Glover, and he asks, ""If hope and change define the 2008 campaign, what two words are going to make-- are going to define 2012?"" \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: I-- you know, I haven\'t quite boiled it down to a bumper sticker yet. But I think what\'ll-- define 2012 is-- you know, our vision for the future. That\'s three words. Four. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: It\'s five, actually. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: ...Vision for the future. Four. There is-- going to be a contest of values and-- and vision in 2012. Nobody\'s going to deny that we\'re not where we need to be. That the economy is not producing enough jobs that pay well and give people-- a leg up on life. And so the question is, ""What\'s most likely to get us there?"" Now there are going to be some folks who make the argument that if you just slash spending, eliminate regulations that prevent us from polluting our air or polluting our water or, you know, we bust labor unions, that that in and of itself is going to restore the American dream. I don\'t think most Americans believe that. I think they understand that we\'ve got to invest in making sure we\'ve got the best education system possible, that we\'ve got to invest in basic research. That part of what made us an economic superpower was we had the best technology, the best infrastructure, and that government has some role to play in that. And so the question\'s going to be-- you know, which vision is more persuasive to the American people? \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: One of your potential opponents, Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, very tough speech at the Reagan Library last week. He said-- you don\'t have the courage to lead. He called you a bystander in the Oval Office. And I want to get this right, because it-- what he ended up saying is that-- you haven\'t brought people together. Now you\'re going to divide them. And he asked, ""What happened to State Senator Obama? When did he decide to become one of the dividers he spoke of so eloquently in 2004?"" \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, look-- you know, if the guy\'s thinking about running for president, he\'s going to say a lot of stuff. And I think in the Republican primaries-- saying nasty stuff about me is probably-- polls pretty well-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --he basically says he did in New Jersey, brought people together, which you haven\'t been able to do in Washington. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- you know, I\'m not sure that-- folks in New Jersey necessarily would agree with that. But here\'s-- here\'s the broader point. I don\'t think that the American people would dispute that at every step of the way, I have done everything I can to try to get the Republican Party to work with me to deal with what is the biggest crisis of our lifetimes. And each time, all we\'ve got from them is ""no."" I think-- the-- the-- you\'re not going to get too much dispute about that, whether-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: How is that going to change in the next-- \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: --the-- well, the-- you know, the way it\'s going to change is because the American people are gonna have the say about where we want to go, you know? They\'re going to have a decision to make. And they\'re going to say to themselves, ""You know what? President Obama wanted to reduce the deficit by not only cutting spending, as he\'s already done, but also by making sure that-- the most fortunate in our society are paying their fair share. That we\'re closing corporate loopholes that small businesses don\'t get. The Republicans have said no to that."" Well, that\'s a contrast in approaches. And-- you know, when you tick down which approach the American people generally prefer, they\'ll say mine. Now what they\'ll say is, ""He hasn\'t been able to get it through Congress."" And, you know, I-- I\'m the first one to acknowledge that-- the relations between myself and-- the Republican Congress have not been good over the last several months, but it\'s not for a lack of effort. It has to do with the fact that-- you know, they\'ve made a decision to follow-- what is a pretty-- extreme approach to governance. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You might have a new issue on your plate over the weekend. Bank of America now is doing a $5 service fee for using your debit cards. Drawing-- a lot of outrage, a lot of questions. And basically the questions boil down to what Vikki Manko of Naperville, Illinois asks. ""These are the types of things government should get involved in and put a stop to."" Can you put a stop to that? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- what we did was we put a stop through-- The Financial Reform Act of them charging fees-- for credit cards. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And the banks are saying-- \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: And so-- Well-- what-- what the banks are saying is-- that ""Rather than take a little bit less of a profit. Rather than paying multimillion dollar bonuses. Let\'s treat our customers right."" And this is exactly why we need this consumer finance-- protection bureau that we set up that is ready to go. And what we need is a confirmation of the person I\'ve appointed, Rich Cordray treasurer of Ohio. Back in Ohio, Republicans and Democrats both think he\'s terrific and he\'s fair. But this is exactly why we need somebody who\'s sole job it is to prevent this kind of stuff from happening. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you stop this service charge? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, you can stop it because it-- if you-- if you say to the banks, ""You don\'t have some inherent right just to-- you know, get a certain amount of profit. If your customers-- are being mistreated. That you have to treat them fairly and transparently."" And-- and my hope is is that you\'re going to see a bunch of-- the banks, who say to themselves, ""You know what? This is actually not good business practice."" Banks can make money. They can succeed, the old-fashioned way, by earning it. By lending to small businesses. By lending to consumers. By making sure that-- you know, we are building the economy together. But-- you know, without the kinds of protections that we\'re starting to see the Republicans try to roll back-- we\'re going to continue to have these kinds of problems. And this is exactly-- the sort of stuff that folks are frustrated by. This, by the way, is an example of the-- the contrasting visions that we have. If-- if-- if-- the Republican Party believes that we should do nothing to curb abuses on Wall Street and roll back regulations put in place to prevent the next big financial crisis, well, I\'ve got a big difference with them. And I think the American people are going to be on my side on that. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Your White House has faced a lot of questions on Solyndra, the-- solar panel company you paid a visit to back in 2010. You really held it up then as a model for jobs and clean energy. Do you regret that? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, I don\'t, because if you look at the overall portfolio of loan guarantees that have been provided-- overall, it\'s doing well. And what we always understood was that not every single business is going to succeed in clean energy. But if we want to compete with China, which is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into this space. If we want to compete with other countries that are heavily subsidizing the industries of the future, we\'ve got to make sure that our guys here in the United States of America at least have a shot. Now there are gonna be some failures, and Solyndra\'s an example. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --getting warnings not to back that company up, not to visit. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- you know, it-- hindsight is always 20/20. It went through the regular review process. And people felt like this was a good bet. But the fact of the matter is-- is that if we don\'t get behind clean energy, if we don\'t get behind advanced battery manufacturing, if we\'re not the ones who are creating the cars of the future, then we\'re not going to be able to make stuff here in the United States of America. And one of the most important things that I want to do over the next several years is restore a sense that America can manufacture, but we don\'t just purchase stuff from someplace else, but we\'re also exporting to other countries. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you about Al Qaeda-- following the killing on Friday of Anwar Awlaki. Back in July-- Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said that the strategic defeat of Al Qaeda is within reach. This as we approach the tenth anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan. How close are we to that strategic defeat? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I think that we have done more in the last couple of years-- than any time in the last ten years-- to bring that about. Obviously, the most prominent-- case was-- us getting Bin Laden. But when you look at that entire leadership tier of Al Qaeda, they have been decimated. And-- they are-- rapidly approaching the point where they just cannot replace trained, skilled operatives-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --attack on our homeland? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- you know, I think that-- given the nature of our open society, we\'re always going to be vulnerable-- to the possible terrorist attack. But for them to be able to mount something that is a big project with a lot of financing, that is very difficult for them to do now. They\'re still dangerous. They\'re still our number one enemy. We\'ve got to make sure that we-- don\'t let up. But I think that we are in a position where over the next couple of years, if we stay on it, that-- it\'s gonna be very difficult for them to mount the kinds of spectacular attacks-- that we saw on 9/11. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You gave a pretty passionate speech at the Human Rights Campaign fund Saturday night. And said that every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law. Is that possible without legal gay marriage? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I-- you know, I think that it is certainly possible for us to make sure that-- not only can they serve in our military, but we fully support them. That-- hospital visitation is available-- to gay and lesbian partners. That they\'re not discriminated-- against on the job. Being gay or lesbian is not a fireable offense. That at minimum, that gays and lesbians have strong civil unions that provide the same kinds of protections. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: At minimum? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: At minimum. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So you\'ve said your position is evolving. You said you\'re struggling with it. What more do you need to know? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- you know-- I probably won\'t-- make news right now, George. But I-- I think that there\'s no doubt that-- as I see-- friends, families-- children of gay couples-- who are thriving-- you know, that-- that has an impact on how I think about these issues. It\'s also one of the reasons that I made the decision for us not to defend-- The Defense of Marriage Act, which-- I believe violated the Constitution. And, you know, is going to be-- decided in the courts probably-- in the next-- next few terms. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You think you\'ll change your mind before the election? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know-- I-- I\'m-- I\'m-- still working on it. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And you\'re not going to tell it\'s how long it\'s going to take? (LAUGH) Let me just finish up with a couple personal questions. We got a lot of those-- on Yahoo, as well. A lot of people want to know-- first of all, I should say happy anniversary. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you so much. 19 years. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: 19 years. And they want to know what is the best single piece of advice Michelle has given you? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, that when all is said and done-- the mark of success is do you have children who are happy and healthy and-- able to go out there and function as responsible-- loving people. And-- so far so good. You know, I-- I think in-- in this business-- as is true for a lot of professionals, I think-- you love your kids, but you always got these distractions and they\'re always-- things tugging at you. And Michelle very early on-- being that anchor that says, ""No, no, you know, if we\'ve got-- a parent/teacher conference--"" \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You\'re gonna be there. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: ""--we\'re gonna be there."" At soccer games. You know, Sasha may say it doesn\'t matter, but it does. That steady drumbeat-- from Michelle-- was exactly right. And-- it-- it\'s-- it\'s part of the reason why, I think-- not only are the kids doing well, but-- it-- it provides me-- just a constant source of joy and-- and sustenance. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Four years is a long time in kids\' years. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They were pretty little during the-- the last campaign. How do you protect them? This time around, when everybody\'s saying all these bad things about you? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, so far so good. I mean, partly because-- they don\'t watch-- they don\'t watch news. Although, the-- you know, they\'re starting to read. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: On the internet, right? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: They-- they\'re starting to go on the internet. I think that the thing we worry about has less to do with-- them hearing folks say mean stuff about me, which-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They don\'t have to answer them. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: They-- they-- they don\'t-- they don\'t-- they know who their daddy is. And-- and they\'re not worried about that. The thing I do worry about is trying to figure out that balance of making sure they\'ve got space to make mistakes, be teenagers, et cetera. But obviously, they\'re not-- typical-- in some ways. So they\'re still having sleepovers. And they\'re still going to the mall. And they\'re still going to movies. But they\'ve got this guy with a gun following them around! And-- and-- and so just-- just trying to make sure that that space is maintained. We\'ve been able to do it so far. Our secret service detail is terrific about it. But it-- it\'s a balance that has to be struck. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, since we are on the web here-- live on Yahoo.com, everyone wants to know which-- websites do you surf? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I\'m pretty eclectic. You know, I\'ll-- you know, I read a lot of newspapers that I used to read in print, I now read on-- on the web. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you have an iPad or just-- \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: I-- I\'ve got an iPad. And-- and-- Steve Jobs actually gave it to me-- a little bit early. And-- (LAUGH) \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, that\'s pretty cool. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah, it was cool. I got it directly from him. And-- you know, I go to ABCNews.com, of course, and Yahoo. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And Yahoo, too, thank you. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Of course. But-- you know, typically, my-- I-- I-- I read on the web what I read in hard copy. I mean, there-- there are some exceptions. There are some blogs and some websites that-- that are interesting that-- you don\'t have-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --make a comment. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: I-- you know-- I don\'t. I-- I figure if I-- if I got started-- I wouldn\'t stop. And I\'ve got other things to do. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, thanks for your time. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: I appreciate it. Thank you so much. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And thanks to all of you for joining us on Yahoo.com and ABCNews.com. If you missed any of it, you can get it any time on either website. Take care.']",3,"– President Obama made waves in his latest interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC, in which he spoke out against Bank of America’s unpopular new $5 fee for debit card users. “This is exactly why we need this Consumer Finance Protection Bureau,” Obama said. Asked directly if he could stop it, he replied, “You can stop it … if you say to the banks, ‘You don’t have some inherent right just to get a certain amount of profit if your customers are being mistreated.'"" That drew a rebuke from the American Bankers Association, which called it “disappointing and puzzling that the president would attack a private corporation for responding to government price fixing,” according to Politico. That’s not the only soundbite generating interest: Asked if Americans were better off than they were four years ago—the line Ronald Reagan used to defeat Jimmy Carter—Obama replied, “They’re not better off than they were before Lehman’s collapse, before the financial crisis. ... The unemployment rate is still way too high.”"
"['For First Time In 130 Years, More Young Adults Live With Parents Than With Partners \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Education Images/UIG via Getty Images Education Images/UIG via Getty Images \n \n For the first time in more than 130 years, Americans ages 18-34 are more likely to live with their parents than in any other living situation, according to a new analysis by the Pew Research Center. \n \n In that age group, 32.1 percent of people live in their parents\' house, while 31.6 live with a spouse or partner in their own homes and 14 percent live alone, as single parents or in a home with roommates or renters. The rest live with another family member, a nonfamily member or in group-living situations such as a college dorm or prison. \n \n toggle caption Pew Research Center/NPR \n \n Pew notes that this is not a record high percentage for the number of young people living at home — in 1940, for instance, approximately 35 percent of people in that age range lived at home. \n \n But back then, living with a spouse or partner was even more popular than that. Today not so: More people choose an alternative living situation, and out of the crowded field of choices, life with Mom and/or Dad has become the top pick for millennials. \n \n Well — some millennials. Men, for starters. \n \n American men ages 18-34 live with their parents 35 percent of the time, and with a spouse or partner 28 percent of the time. For women, the numbers are nearly reversed; 35 percent live with a partner, while 29 percent live with their parents. \n \n Living with mom or dad: More common for sons than daughters https://t.co/7SxlYSwEBi pic.twitter.com/gQTFUJZKiU — Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) May 24, 2016 \n \n Less educated young adults are also more likely to live with their parents than are their college-educated counterparts — no surprise, Pew notes, given the financial prospects in today\'s economy. \n \n Black and Hispanic young people, compared with white people, are in the same situation. \n \n For black people in particular, the ""new"" milestone isn\'t so new at all. Black young adults have been more likely to live with their parents than in any other situation since 1980. Today, 36 percent of black millennials live with their parents, while 17 percent live with a spouse or partner. \n \n Meanwhile, taken as a whole, women, white people, Asian/Pacific Islanders and people with bachelor\'s degrees are still more likely to live with spouses or partners than with their parents. \n \n But the overall trend is the same for every demographic group — living with parents is increasingly common. \n \n (Young Americans are still less likely to live with their parents than their southern European friends. In Macedonia, more than 70 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds reportedly live at home, Pew says.) \n \n For many millennials, Pew\'s conclusions might seem both unsurprising and easy to explain: The Great Recession happened, of course! \n \n But the rise in the number of young adults living at home started before the economic crash — and so did the possible contributing factors. Male unemployment has been on the rise for decades, Pew says. Even those who have jobs are making less than they would have in their parents\' day — for young men, Pew notes, inflation-adjusted wages have been falling since 1970. \n \n And then fewer young people are married than in decades past. Even accounting for the increased popularity of cohabitation, there are just fewer paired-up 20-somethings and 30-somethings than there used to be. \n \n In general, the study shows how dramatically the living situations of 18- to 34-year-olds have changed since 1880, when the data begin. \n \n Living alone, as a single parent, or with roommates — once a rarity — is now the choice of 14 percent of people in that age group. And a full 25 percent of young men are now living with other family, nonfamily or group quarters. \n \n Male prosperity rose steadily, and more and more men left the nest — until the \'60s and \'70s, when wages started to drop and more men stayed home. \n \n And women? For decades women who worked were more likely to live with their parents than with a partner or spouse — because wives were discouraged from having jobs, per Pew\'s straightforward interpretation. \n \n But now more and more young women have jobs, and it\'s unemployed women who are more likely to live with their parents. And yet, even as female prosperity rose, so did the number of young women living at home. \n \n Pew speculated it might because of men\'s lower earnings keeping women from marrying and moving out. Seem plausible? The question might make for a fruitful conversation in households across America tonight ... just ask Mom to pass the peas and the theories.', 'Members of the graduating class at the Savannah College of Art and Design commencement in Atlanta. For the first time on record, living with parents is now the most common arrangement for Americans age 18 to 34. (John Amis/ASSOCIATED PRESS) \n \n It’s true: Kids Today are more dependent on their parents than Kids Yesterday. \n \n At least when it comes to housing. \n \n Nearly a third of Americans age 18 to 34 were living with their parents in 2014, according to a new analysis from the Pew Research Center. That’s the highest share since the Great Depression. \n \n It was also the first time since at least 1880 that young adults were more likely to live in their parents’ homes than in their own households with a spouse or other romantic partner. \n \n Crusty old pundits will surely declare this a sign of millennials’ failure to launch. They will bemoan young people’s insistence on mooching off of beleaguered boomer parents rather than going into the real world and getting their own grown-up jobs, spouses and mortgages. Millennial basement-dwelling — along with millennial musical tastes, millennial slang and millennial fashions — is thus clear evidence of a generation-wide crisis of character. \n \n The millennial generation is now the largest, most ethnically diverse generation in American history. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) \n \n But there are a few reasons all this re-nesting may not be such a bad thing. \n \n For one, consider the macroeconomic and social conditions that today’s young adults face. \n \n Their unemployment (and underemployment) rates remain relatively high, as do their student debt burdens. Their wages have stagnated. \n \n Young adults want to live on their own and aspire to purchase homes. But homeownership remains far out of their reach. National home prices today are not so far below their pre-recession peaks, with some metro areas even reaching all-time highs. \n \n Meanwhile, rents, too, have skyrocketed, fast outpacing inflation. \n \n Young people are also living with their parents in higher numbers in part because they’re delaying marriage. This is a consequence of both precarious job prospects and a growing perception that financial security is a prerequisite to tying the knot — which the vast majority of singles say they still very much want to do. \n \n In this context, swallowing their pride and living above the family garage rather than frittering away money on rent looks rather financially prudent. \n \n Second, the growth of intergenerational households shouldn’t be so alarming given how common this living arrangement is everywhere else in the developed world. In fact, the share of young adults here who live with their folks is still relatively low compared with the rate in many of our peer countries. \n \n According to a recent census survey, 42 percent of Canadian adults age 20 to 29 live in their parents’ homes. Across the European Union, nearly half of young adults age 18 to 34 live with their parents. In Japan, about half of unmarried 20-to-34-year-olds (dubbed “parasite singles”) live with their parents, too. \n \n But, you cry: American exceptionalism! We don’t want to be like everyone else! \n \n It’s not clear, though, why a society in which young singles live on their own is more desirable than one in which the same demographic errs on the side of doubling up with relatives. This norm is especially puzzling in the United States, where for decades the tax code has incentivized home buyers to purchase as much house as possible, whether or not they need the space. \n \n Perhaps it makes sense to use the housing stock we already have more efficiently, rather than insisting that young people move out as part of some artificial adulthood milestone. \n \n Of course, boomers may object to bunking up with their boomeranging offspring, even on occasions when they do have ample space. \n \n Well, boohoo. \n \n Today’s boomers have benefited for decades from huge public intergenerational transfers of wealth. Is it really so much to ask that they make some much smaller private intergenerational transfers to their own children? \n \n The public infrastructure that boomers have enjoyed all their lives was largely built by their elders. Those who went to college paid very low tuition and received much more generous public subsidies for their schooling. For decades they have paid tax rates far too low to actually fund the government services they receive. They have racked up trillions in federal debt and handed the tab to their kids. \n \n As boomers increasingly age into Medicare eligibility, those intergenerational transfers will further balloon. \n \n Take a two-earner couple who worked every year of their adult lives, with both spouses receiving the average wage until turning 65 and retiring last year. For every $1 that they paid into the Medicare system, they will receive $3 back in benefits, according to estimates from the Urban Institute. \n \n Guess who has to pay the difference? Yup. Their good-for-nothin’, basement-dwelling, parasitic boomerang kids. \n \n In this light, the return home of young adults should be seen less as an act of morally bankrupt mooching and more as a step toward balancing the intergenerational ledger.']",2,"– The Pew Research Center is out with an interesting stat: More people ages 18 to 34 are living with their parents than with romantic partners—the first time that's happened in more than 130 years, which is when the data starts, notes NPR. At the Washington Post, Catherine Rampell runs through some of the reasons, including high unemployment among the young, student debt, rising home prices and rents, and stagnant wages. Considering all that, it's ""rather financially prudent"" for millennials to stay with mom and dad longer, a situation that's not all that unusual in the rest of the world, she writes. But her bigger message is for those ""crusty"" baby boomers complaining about a lack of character in the younger set: ""Well, boohoo."" ""Today’s boomers have benefited for decades from huge public intergenerational transfers of wealth,"" writes Rampell. ""Is it really so much to ask that they make some much smaller private intergenerational transfers to their own children?"" They've paid low tuition and too-low taxes for the services they get back, and they'll hand over an enormous public debt. Plus, today's millennials will have to make up for their out-of-whack Medicare benefits.

"['Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walk to the Senate floor Wednesday. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Congressional leaders reach budget deal The agreement would raise stiff spending caps and help stave off a shutdown. \n \n Congressional leaders on Wednesday clinched a two-year deal to lift strict budget caps on defense and domestic spending, likely putting an end to a series of short-term spending bills and shutdown fights that have defined Washington the past few months. \n \n The deal is expected to increase defense and domestic spending by roughly $300 billion over two years, according to administration and congressional sources, as well as lift the debt ceiling through the election and include tens of billions of dollars in disaster aid. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n ""This bill is the product of extensive negotiations among congressional leaders and the White House. No one thinks this bill is perfect. But we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in announcing the agreement. \n \n ""The budget deal doesn’t have everything Democrats want. It doesn’t have everything the Republicans want. But it has a great deal of what the American people want,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). ""After months of legislative logjams, this budget deal is a genuine breakthrough."" \n \n The most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time. \n \n The Senate is expected vote on the pact on Thursday, according to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). It\'s likely to pass easily, but House approval will be a tougher lift. \n \n And though President Donald Trump suggested that the government could shut down without action on immigration, a top White House aide signaled that Trump supports the bill. \n \n “I’m not going to say every piece of it. But obviously, we’re excited about the defense numbers,"" said Marc Short, the White House legislative director. \n \n Trump tweeted in support of the deal a few hours later. \n \n ""The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military,"" he wrote. ""It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!"" \n \n The agreement would increase defense spending this year by $80 billion and domestic spending by $63 billion beyond strict budget caps, according to a summary of the deal obtained by POLITICO. Next year, defense spending would increase by $85 billion and domestic funding by $68 billion beyond the caps. The deal also includes $140 billion for defense and $20 billion for domestic in emergency spending over two years. \n \n A plan to lift the debt limit, which requires action in the coming weeks, and whether to extend expiring tax provisions were among the few outstanding issues that could be attached to the deal, according to aides in both parties familiar with the talks. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said the debt ceiling is likely to be suspended through next March in tandem with the budget deal. Cornyn said nearly $90 billion of disaster aid for wildfires and hurricane damage will also be included. \n \n For such a large package to be passed before funding expires, all 100 senators will need to agree to speedy action on the spending bill and budget package. Any one senator can object to moving forward and derail the leaders’ plan, though McConnell said it is unlikely that the budget deal would fall apart at this late stage. \n \n Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes the deal, said he hasn\'t decided whether he would deny a swift vote — and potentially cause a government shutdown. \n \n McConnell briefed the Senate GOP on the contours of the deal at a party lunch Wednesday, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also read in his members across the Capitol. Both GOP leaders faced pushback, but allies exuded confidence the budget deal will be on Trump\'s desk by Thursday evening. \n \n ""The House, and Republicans in the Senate and some Democrats in the Senate, are totally committed to increasing defense. And you weren\'t going to increase defense successfully without a big increase in nondefense,"" Blunt said. \n \n poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201802/844/1155968404_5728192221001_5728191585001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true \n \n ""I\'ve got mixed feelings,"" said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). “This has been a hard-fought negotiation. I think our leadership really worked hard. It’s obviously not our leadership’s first preference, but we had to work it out with the other side."" \n \n Support from GOP defense hawks, especially in the House, will be critical in passing the bill. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) — at home in Arizona while being treated for brain cancer — and House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) came out strongly in support of the package. \n \n ""This budget agreement is indispensable for our national security,"" the two Republicans said in a joint statement. ""Without it, our military would not be able to defend our nation, as Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and our military leaders have repeatedly warned."" \n \n However, the negotiations hit a major snag on Wednesday: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she cannot support any budget agreement without a commitment from Ryan to vote on an immigration bill to protect immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program. \n \n Still, McConnell and Schumer are bullish about success. The two Senate leaders, along with Ryan and Pelosi, have been engaged in high-level spending talks for weeks. \n \n If all goes according to plan, the Senate will amend a short-term spending bill passed by the House to include the deal to lift strict budget caps and send the package back for the House’s approval before a Thursday night deadline to fund the government. House Democrats moved their annual retreat from Maryland’s Eastern Shore to the U.S. Capitol in anticipation of having to vote on the Senate plan. \n \n Hard-line GOP conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus oppose the deal, which means Ryan will need some votes from Pelosi. But many Republicans are expected to back it. \n \n ""There’s substantial support within our caucus. So I don’t think we’ll need that many Democrat votes,"" said Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.). \n \n poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201804/3805/1155968404_5768203162001_5767695500001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" \n \n Pelosi is facing pressure from some of rank-and-file members — as well as from progressive groups — to reject a budget caps agreement unless Trump and the Republicans agree to a legislative fix for Dreamers. After surveying her caucus, she implored Ryan on the House floor to ""Let Congress work its will. What are you afraid of?"" \n \n ""Without a commitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell, this package does not have my support,"" Pelosi said. McConnell promised to hold a floor debate on various Dreamers proposals later this month as long as the government remains open. \n \n Ryan has said he would bring up a Dreamers deal if Trump signs off on it. \n \n ""We\'ve been very clear about this,"" Ryan said at a news conference earlier this week. ""We will take a bill that the president supports."" \n \n Republicans said privately they were not going to overreact to Pelosi\'s comments, even as she held the House floor for hours demanding action for Dreamers. Pelosi and her aides have been part of the budget caps negotiations from the start, and no deal will occur unless all four party leaders on the Hill support any agreement and work to pass it. \n \n On Tuesday, Schumer said he and Pelosi are aligned strategically on moving forward, potentially defusing another government shutdown. \n \n And many Democrats and Republicans will find relief in a break from budget brinkmanship and in boosting domestic programs and defense spending. The House passed a bill Tuesday funding the government until March 23, which would allow Congress to write a new spending bill for the rest of the year at levels set by the emerging budget deal, potentially avoiding more shutdown fights in an election year. \n \n Though Democrats were unable to secure complete parity in domestic spending alongside the big boost in military dollars, they were quick to note the agreement includes $20 billion for infrastructure, $5.8 billion for child care and $6 billion to fight opioid addiction. The bill also includes a two-year extension of expired Community Health Centers funding and a 10-year extension of Children\'s Health Insurance Plan funding. \n \n Separately, Schumer and McConnell have been discussing how the Senate will handle a debate on immigration to protect immigrants under DACA from deportation. While House Democrats had been pushing Senate Democrats to clinch a DACA deal in tandem with the budget, there is little hope of a deal on immigration this week. \n \n All McConnell would promise is a wide-ranging floor debate to begin next week. \n \n Jennifer Scholtes contributed to this report.', 'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., smiles as he meets with reporters as work continues on a plan to keep the government as a funding deadline approaches, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday,...

"['A berm holding the flooded Missouri River back from a Nebraska nuclear power station collapsed early Sunday, but federal regulators said they were monitoring the situation and there was no danger. \n \n The Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station shut down in early April for refueling, and there is no water inside the plant, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. Also, the river is not expected to rise higher than the level the plant was designed to handle. NRC spokesman Victor Dricks said the plant remains safe. \n \n The federal commission had inspectors at the plant 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Omaha when the 2,000-foot (610-meter) berm collapsed about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. Water surrounded the auxiliary and containment buildings at the plant, it said in a statement. \n \n The Omaha Public Power District has said the complex will not be reactivated until the flooding subsides. Its spokesman, Jeff Hanson, said the berm wasn\'t critical to protecting the plant but a crew will look at whether it can be patched. \n \n ""That was an additional layer of protection we put in,"" Hanson said. \n \n The berm\'s collapse didn\'t affect the reactor shutdown cooling or the spent fuel pool cooling, but the power supply was cut after water surrounded the main electrical transformers, the NRC said. Emergency generators powered the plant until an off-site power supply was connected Sunday afternoon, according to OPPD. \n \n NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko said the loss of the berm at Fort Calhoun nuclear plant doesn\'t threaten the safety of the plant. \n \n ""There are other structures and systems in place that can ensure they will continue operating safely,"" Jaczko said. \n \n Jaczko will tour the Fort Calhoun plant Monday. His visit was scheduled last week. On Sunday, he toured Nebraska\'s other nuclear power plant, which sits along the Missouri River near Brownville. Cooper nuclear power plant is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Omaha and run by the Nebraska Public Power District. \n \n Jaczko said he can\'t predict what the river will do this summer but that NPPD and OPPD seem to be taking appropriate steps to defend against flooding. \n \n Jaczko spent much of his tour of Cooper asking NPPD officials and the NRC\'s local inspectors questions about the plant and this year\'s flooding. He said his visit was designed to gather information. \n \n NPPD officials have been monitoring river levels closely during the flooding, and they have already brought in more than 5,000 tons of sand to build barricades protecting the Cooper plant, the onsite power substations and the plant\'s access roads. \n \n Accessing critical parts of the plant requires visitors to use ladders or steel stairs to climb over sandbag barriers both outside and inside the doors. When the Jaczko saw one of Cooper\'s two back-up diesel generators, he had to climb over three different sandbag barriers to get there. \n \n The Cooper plant remains dry because it sits at an elevation above the river level. The base of Cooper and its storage area for used nuclear fuel is 903 feet (275.23 meters) above sea level while on Sunday the river was just above 899 feet. \n \n Cooper would be shut down if the river rose to 902 feet (274.93 meters) above sea level, but officials say that is unlikely. \n \n ""This plant is designed to deal with a flood much higher than we are seeing _ 906 feet,"" Jaczko said. \n \n Both nuclear plants issued flooding alerts earlier this month, although they were routine as the river\'s rise has been expected. Cooper has been operating at full capacity. \n \n Flooding remains a concern all along the Missouri because of massive amounts of water the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released from upstream reservoirs. The river is expected to rise as much as 7 feet (2 meters) above flood stage in much of Nebraska and Iowa and as much as 10 feet (3 meters) over flood stage in parts of Missouri. \n \n The corps expects the river to remain high at least into August because of heavy spring rains in the upper Plains and substantial Rocky Mountain snowpack melting into the river basin. \n \n ___ \n \n Josh Funk Associated Press Writer Timberly Ross contributed to this report from Omaha and can be reached at http://twitter.com/timberlysross.', 'The head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been dispatched to a nuclear power plant in Fort Calhoun, Neb., where a berm collapsed Sunday, but the public is in no danger, officials said. \n \n The breach allowed Missouri River flood waters to reach containment buildings and transformers and forcing the shutdown of electrical power. \n \n Backup generators are cooling the nuclear material at the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station. \n \n The plant has not operated since April, and officials say there is no danger to the public. \n \n Jeff Hanson, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District, told The Associated Press that the breached berm wasn\'t critical to protecting the plant, although a crew will look at whether it can be patched. \n \n ""That was an additional layer of protection we put in,"" Hanson said. \n \n Nevertheless, federal inspectors are on the scene. \n \n Meanwhile, there was no protecting thousands of homes in Minot, N.D., where flooding of the Souris River hit its peak today, flooding more than 4,000 homes, including Leslie Dull\'s. \n \n ""When you actually see your house,"" Dull said, ""and you know it\'s not just your basement, it\'s your whole house, it\'s ... \n \n ""I\'m sorry,"" she said, as she broke down crying. \n \n There is some good news: The river in Minot peaked two feet lower than expected. But it is nearly 13 feet above flood stage and it is expected to stay near that level for days. \n \n ""It could be two to four to six weeks, or more, before the water actually goes back into its banks ...

Bill Seekins of the North Dakota National Guard told ABC News during a tour through the flooded areas. \n \n Seekins described the scene as ""almost apocalyptic."" \n \n Sgt. Dave Dodds of the North Dakota National Guard said heavy rains from Saturday will keep the river at its historic crest for longer than expected. \n \n ""Authorities were hoping for maybe a day or two before it started to recede, but you can add maybe an additional 24 hours onto that,"" Dodds said. \n \n Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman said the devastation may be even greater than expected. \n \n ""I think we\'re going to reach probably 4,500 [homes] before this is all done, where we\'ve got a lot of water on these homes,"" Zimbelman said. \n \n Randy Nelson and his wife just bought a camper, knowing their house is flooded. They are living in a shopping center parking lot, powerless to do anything but wait. \n \n He said the hardest part is ""patience ... not knowing where you are going to live. It\'s tough."" \n \n But there have been victories. ABC News watched Koni Aho race to build a berm around her restaurant down river from Minot. Twenty-four hours later there was still no water in the restaurant. \n \n ""I was bound and determined,"" she said. ""I don\'t care. I said, \'It\'s just dirt. We can move it.\'"" \n \n Forecasters said scattered storms were in today\'s forecast, but the worst part of the storm will likely to be south and east of the Souris River Basin. \n \n Neighbors Helping Neighbors \n \n Officials were building and re-enforcing levees in the towns of Sawyer and Velvenau in fear that all the water that has been coming through Minot will swamp the two towns. \n \n As residents and officials brace for the worst, acts of generosity were seen throughout the community. \n \n Garages were turned into storage units for flood victims and families and churches opened their doors to other displaced community members. \n \n ""For the rest of the country, that is kind of mind-boggling. But ... that\'s how we are in North Dakota,"" Sen. John Hoeven told the Associated Press. \n \n Evangelical Lutheran pastor Mike Johnson said he was too preoccupied with helping other people that he wasn\'t sure about the condition of his belongings after being evacuated from the flood zone the previous week. \n \n But Lutherans in a neighboring town stepped in and took care of his files and equipment in his office. \n \n ""They just showed up on Tuesday and carted stuff off for us,"" Johnson told the Associated Press. \n \n ABC News\' Gerard McNiff and the Associated Press contributed to this report.']",2,"– Floodwaters have poured over a berm surrounding a Nebraska nuclear power plant, forcing a shutdown of electricity used to control cooling systems.

A Spanish... (Associated Press) \n \n A final decision has not been made and the move is still under review, the official said. But the fact that it is even being considered underscores the level of concern within the administration over the possible damage from the months-long spying scandal _ including the most recent disclosure that the National Security Agency was monitoring the communications of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n \n On Monday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for a ""total review of all intelligence programs"" following the Merkel allegations. In a statement, the California Democrat said the White House had informed her that ""collection on our allies will not continue."" \n \n The administration official said that statement was not accurate, but added that some unspecified changes already had been made and more were being considered, including terminating the collection of communications from friendly heads of state. \n \n The official was not authorized to discuss the review by name and insisted on anonymity. \n \n Reports based on new leaks from former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden indicate that the NSA listened to Merkel and 34 other foreign leaders. \n \n ""With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of U.S. allies _ including France, Spain, Mexico and Germany _ let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed,"" Feinstein said. She added that the U.S. should not be ""collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers"" unless in an emergency with approval of the president. \n \n In response to the revelations, German officials said Monday that the U.S. could lose access to an important law enforcement tool used to track terrorist money flows. Other longtime allies have also expressed their displeasure about the U.S. spying on their leaders. \n \n As possible leverage, German authorities cited last week\'s non-binding resolution by the European Parliament to suspend a post-9/11 agreement allowing the Americans access to bank transfer data to track the flow of terrorist money. A top German official said Monday she believed the Americans were using the information to gather economic intelligence apart from terrorism and said the agreement, known as the SWIFT agreement, should be suspended. \n \n European Union officials who are in Washington to meet with lawmakers ahead of White House talks said U.S. surveillance of their people could affect negotiations over a U.S.-Europe trade agreement. They said European privacy must be better protected. \n \n Many officials in Germany and other European governments have made clear, however, that they don\'t favor suspending the U.S.-EU trade talks which began last summer because both sides stand to gain so much through the proposed deal, especially against competition from China and other emerging markets. \n \n As tensions with European allies escalate, the top U.S. intelligence official declassified dozens of pages of top-secret documents in an apparent bid to show the NSA was acting legally when it gathered millions of Americans\' phone records. \n \n Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said he was following the president\'s direction to make public as much information as possible about how U.S. intelligence agencies spy under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Monday\'s release of documents focused on Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows the bulk collection of U.S. phone records. \n \n The document release is part of an administration-wide effort to preserve the NSA\'s ability to collect bulk data, which it says is key to tracking key terror suspects, but which privacy activists say is a breach of the Constitution\'s ban on unreasonable search and seizure of evidence from innocent Americans. \n \n The release of the documents comes ahead of a House Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday on FISA reform. \n \n The documents support administration testimony that the NSA worked to operate within the law and fix errors when they or their systems overreached. One of the documents shows the NSA admitting to the House Intelligence Committee that one of its automated systems picked up too much telephone metadata. The February 2009 document indicates the problem was fixed. \n \n Another set of documents shows the judges of the FISA court seemed satisfied with the NSA\'s cooperation. It says that in September 2009, the NSA advised the Senate Intelligence Committee about its continuing collection of Americans\' phone records and described a series of demonstrations and briefings it conducted for three judges on the secretive U.S. spy court. The memorandum said the judges were ""engaged throughout and asked questions, which were answered by the briefers and other subject matter experts,"" and said the judges appreciated the amount and quality of information the NSA provided. \n \n It said that two days later, one of the judges, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, renewed the court\'s permission to resume collecting phone records. \n \n The documents also included previously classified testimony from 2009 for the House Intelligence Committee by Michael Leiter, then head of the National Counterterrorism Center. He and other officials said collecting Americans\' phone records helped indict Najibullah Zazi, who was accused in a previously disclosed 2009 terror plot to bomb the New York City subways. \n \n The documents also show the NSA considered tracking targets using cellphone location data, and ran tests to see if it was technically possible to gather U.S. cell-site data, which can show where a cellphone user traveled. According to an April 2011 memo the NSA consulted the Justice Department first, which said such collection was legal. Only later did the NSA inform the FISA court of the testing. \n \n NSA commander Gen. Keith Alexander revealed the testing earlier this month to Congress but said the agency did not use the capability to track Americans\' cellphone locations nor deem it necessary right now. \n \n Asked Monday whether the NSA intelligence gathering had been used not only to protect national security but American economic interests as well, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: ""We do not use our intelligence capabilities for that purpose. We use it for security purposes."" \n \n National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden later clarified that: ""We do not use our intelligence capabilities to give U.S. companies an advantage, not ruling out that we are interested in economic information."" \n \n Still, Carney acknowledged the tensions with allies over the eavesdropping disclosures and said the White House was ""working to allay those concerns,"" though he refused to discuss any specific reports or provide details of internal White House discussions. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Kimberly Dozier at http://twitter.com/kimberlydozier \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Ted Bridis and Jack Gillum in Washington, Frank Jordan, Geir Moulson and Robert H.

"['(CNN) -- Cliven Bundy -- the Nevada rancher turned conservative folk hero for bucking the federal government\'s attempts to stop his cattle from grazing on public land -- admits he doesn\'t understand the bipartisan uproar over his comments suggesting blacks might have been better off under slavery. \n \n But in a contentious interview Friday on CNN\'s ""New Day,"" Bundy stood by his remarks, saying he\'s not a racist but only somebody who speaks his mind, perhaps using politically incorrect language. \n \n ""Maybe I sinned, and maybe I need to ask forgiveness, and maybe I don\'t know what I actually said, but when you talk about prejudice, we\'re talking about not being able to exercise what we think. ... If I say Negro or black boy or slave, if those people cannot take those kind of words and not be (offended), then Martin Luther King hasn\'t got his job done yet,"" he told anchor Chris Cuomo on Friday, adding, ""We need to get over this prejudice stuff."" \n \n Bundy brought up civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, who was arrested in December 1955 for not giving up her seat on a public bus to a white man. The arrest sparked the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott. \n \n King would have wanted Parks to sit anywhere on a bus, according to Bundy. The 67-year-old added: ""I want her to sit anywhere in the bus, and I want to sit next to her anywhere in the bus."" \n \n In one exchange with Cuomo, Bundy said, ""I don\'t know how to talk about these ethnic groups. ..."" \n \n ""Then don\'t,"" Cuomo said. \n \n For two decades, Bundy\'s cattle have fed off government-owned land without paying grazing fees like thousands of other ranchers. He claims he won\'t do business with the federal government because, in his view, the Constitution doesn\'t say Americans can\'t use land owned by the federal government. He said he\'d be willing to talk with state and local authorities.. \n \n ""I\'ll be damned if this is the property of the United States. They have no business here,"" he said on ""New Day."" \n \n ""This is a sovereign state, the sovereign state of Nevada. The federal government has nothing to do with public land in Nevada."" He said other ranchers are as frustrated as he is. \n \n This stance made him a darling of some conservatives in the media and Republican circles upset over what they\'ve deemed government overreach. Militiamen rallied by the side of the 67-year-old rancher as federal rangers tried to force him off his land. \n \n Bundy won that standoff, but he didn\'t stop talking. \n \n Speaking to reporters over the weekend, he recalled driving by a public housing project in North Las Vegas, Nevada, and seeing ""at least a half-dozen (black) people sitting on the porch, they didn\'t have nothing to do."" \n \n ""Because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do?"" he added in comments first reported by The New York Times and later seen on video. ""They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. \n \n ""And I\'ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn\'t get no more freedom. They got less freedom."" \n \n The remarks have since gone viral, drawing widespread condemnation from Democrats and Republicans alike. The rancher said he doesn\'t feel ""abandoned"" by the uproar by the likes of right-wing radio firebrand and Fox News host Sean Hannity, who has ripped what he called the ""ignorant, racist, repugnant, despicable comments."" \n \n Sen. Rand Paul, who originally supported Bundy\'s case, issued a statement Thursday decrying Bundy\'s racial comments. \n \n ""His remarks on race are offensive and I wholeheartedly disagree with him,"" said the Kentucky Republican, who\'s considering a 2016 presidential run. \n \n Cliven Bundy: Another conservative folk hero exposes racial nerve \n \n GOP Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada earlier called Bundy\'s supporters ""patriots."" But on Thursday, the senator\'s office said he ""completely disagrees with Mr. Bundy\'s appalling and racist statements."" \n \n Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who had not weighed in on the land dispute, said Bundy\'s words were ""beyond the pale."" \n \n Politicians denounce Bundy\'s racist remarks \n \n On Thursday, in an exclusive interview with CNN\'s Bill Weir, Bundy was asked to elaborate on his remarks. He explained he\'d been simply ""wondering whether (blacks) are that much better off in the situation we\'re in now."" \n \n He backtracked somewhat, insisting he ""didn\'t really mean it to compare (African-Americans\' current plight) with slavery. I meant to compare it with maybe life on the farm or life in the South, where they had some chickens and the gardens, and they had something to do."" \n \n At the same time, Bundy stood by his general premise that blacks once had better lives -- stating that, right now, ""they don\'t have nothing to do with their children, their family unit is ruined. ... That\'s what I was referring to. I don\'t think they have the life that they should have"" because of the government. \n \n How did he arrive at these generalizations? \n \n ""I feel that, because I see that,"" Bundy explained. He said, ""I don\'t think I\'m wrong. I think I\'m right."" \n \n Weir at one point challenged the Nevada rancher about whether he was any more or less a ""welfare queen"" since his cattle have been feeding off the government, literally, by eating grass on public land. \n \n Bundy\'s response: ""I might be a welfare queen. But I\'ll tell you I\'m producing something for America and using a resource that nobody else would use or could use. I\'m putting red meat on the table."" \n \n On Friday, the Bundy Ranch Facebook page elaborated on the rancher\'s ""New Day"" comments. The post concluded with these sentences: \n \n ""I am doing the same thing Rosa Parks did -- I am standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom. Just like the Minutemen at Lexington and Concord, we are saying no to an oppressive government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men. \n \n ""I invite all people in America to join in our peaceful revolution to regain our freedom. That is how America was started, and we need to keep that tradition alive."" \n \n In a press conference later Friday, Bundy added that while he is ""tired"" personally he is ""not tired of talking about race."" \n \n ""It\'s time the United States had a discussion about race,"" he said.

On Saturday, April 19, Bundy gave a news conference to supporters and media gathered near his ranch. This footage is an excerpt of those remarks. (Jasonpatrick11/Bambuser.com) \n \n Prominent Republicans and conservative news media outlets rallied in recent weeks around the cause of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose armed standoff with authorities over grazing rights on federal land had made him an instant folk hero on the right. \n \n But Bundy’s GOP defenders, including Sens. Dean Heller (Nev.) and Rand Paul (Ky.), rapidly abandoned him on Thursday following reports of incendiary remarks that the white rancher made about minorities. Bundy wondered aloud whether blacks would be better off as slaves picking cotton, and alleged that people of color are “against us.” \n \n The controversy marks another major headache for establishment Republicans working to build better relationships with blacks and Hispanics — crucial voting blocs that have increasingly supported Democrats in recent elections. The GOP is in the midst of a messaging tour aimed at reintroducing the party to minority voters, including lawmaker visits to minority neighborhoods and to historically black colleges. \n \n “It undermines the broader, more important goals to rebrand and reestablish a conversation with a community that looks suspiciously upon most of the things you say,” said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, referring to African Americans in particular. \n \n Steele, who was the RNC’s first black chairman, added that Republicans must declare that “there is no place for this level of ignorance and stupidity around matters of race in our party.” \n \n Bundy and his family are entrenched in a decades-long battle with federal authorities after the rancher refused to pay fines for illegally grazing his cattle on federal land. The dispute escalated this month when Bundy and an armed militia of supporters had a standoff with federal agents who attempted to seize his cattle — a confrontation featured prominently during numerous segments on Fox News Channel. \n \n A growing number of Republican lawmakers and conservative pundits had expressed support for Bundy’s cause, while top Democrats — including Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) — denounced him as a vigilante and domestic terrorist. \n \n The New York Times on Thursday reported a series of racial comments Bundy made during the weekend to a reporter and supporters gathered at his ranch. Later Thursday, The Washington Post obtained a video recorded by a Bundy supporter that included all of the remarks. \n \n “I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro,” Bundy said, according to the video. “I’ve often wondered: Are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.” \n \n He also recalled 1960s-era riots by what he called “Negro” groups in Los Angeles. He said he “hardly ever” saw a black person until he was almost a teenager and noted that he is surrounded by white faces. \n \n “Where is our colored brother? Where is our Mexican brother? Where is our Chinese — where are they?” Bundy said. “They’re just as much American as we are, and they’re not with us. If they’re not with us, they’re going to be against us.” \n \n Before those comments were publicized, a number of prominent Republicans had offered support for Bundy’s cause. Heller, Nevada’s junior senator, said Bundy and his makeshift militia were “patriots” during a local news interview. \n \n And Paul said he was sympathetic with Bundy’s opposition to federal ownership of grazing land, while distancing himself from the militant side of Bundy’s resistance. “I’m for obeying the law, and I’m not for a violent outcome,” Paul said Monday. \n \n Much of that support evaporated Thursday. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus called Bundy’s racial comments “completely beyond the pale” and “100 percent wrong.” Paul said the remarks were “offensive,” while a spokesman for Heller declared them “appalling and racist.” \n \n Fox News host Sean Hannity — who had been one of Bundy’s leading champions — said the comments were “beyond repugnant.” But Hannity also lamented that outrage over the remarks would overshadow the “legitimate issue” of government overreach. \n \n Bundy insisted in several media appearances that his comments had been taken out of context, although he repeated some of his observations regarding slavery. “I’m not racist,” he said on one radio show. “They’re making it a racist-type thing.” \n \n The rancher is the latest in a series of figures — including rock singer Ted Nugent and “Duck Dynasty” reality show star Phil Robertson — who made controversial racial remarks after being championed by conservatives. Republican operatives acknowledge that those associations have damaged the party’s attempts to rebrand itself. \n \n Crystal Wright, a conservative commentator, said, “Republicans are part of our own problem,” given the regular embrace of figures such as Bundy. \n \n “My parents didn’t sit-in at lunch counters so that they would be told that they would have been better off learning how to pick cotton,” Wright said. “We as conservatives don’t do a great job of cleaning up these racial missteps.” \n \n The GOP, which has long struggled to attract minority voters, has redoubled its outreach efforts in the wake of President Obama’s reelection and continued growth in the proportion of nonwhite voters that has made it increasingly difficult for Republicans to win national elections. \n \n Prominent Republicans have toured minority neighborhoods nationwide, pushing a message that they are the party that will bring new economic prosperity to impoverished communities. Rep Paul Ryan (Wis.), the party’s 2012 vice presidential candidate, has revived his practice of making regular visits to poor areas of inner cities to meet with residents. \n \n Paul and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) also have addressed audiences at historically black colleges. Priebus is slated to speak this month at one of those schools, Central State University in Ohio. \n \n Some Democrats and political scientists argue that conservative ideology focused on “state’s rights” — an issue linked with preservation of slavery and Jim Crow laws — makes it exceedingly difficult for Republicans to attract minority voters. Bundy’s comments, they said, show a common connection between anti-government ideology and racial animosity. \n \n “He is a window into the soul of modern conservatism,” said Ian Haney López, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who wrote a book called “Dog Whistle Politics.” He added, “A demonization of minorities and a demonization of the government in modern conservatism — those are inextricably linked.” \n \n But many Republicans, including several black GOP operatives, reject that liberal critique. Although the party stumbles on occasion, they said, Republican history is no more racially clouded than that of the Democrats, who dominated the South during the segregation era. \n \n “I just don’t buy the notion that voters are going to see anything more than a single racist rancher in Nevada,” said Ron Christie, a GOP strategist and former special assistant to president George W. Bush. “In the coming weeks and months we’ll see the Democrats saying, ‘See, we told you that Republicans are racist.’ I don’t think a lot of people will buy it.” \n \n Jaime Fuller contributed to this report.', 'Nevada Rancher Cliven Bundy attempted again on Thursday to clarify controversial remarks, but did not walk back what many saw as racist comments he made earlier to the New York Times. \n \n “I may not have a very big word base or vocabulary,” Bundy said, but added that he knows what he means, “when I say slavery.” \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n At a press conference Thursday afternoon, Bundy defended his comments saying he did not say that black people were better off as slaves, just that he was wondering. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: 10 things to know about Cliven Bundy) \n \n “I’m still wondering,” Bundy said, who repeatedly referred to black people throughout his presser as the “Negro community.” \n \n “They seem to be slaves to the welfare system … but they have an opportunity,” Bundy said. \n \n Regarding the attention his initial comments have since received, Bundy said he won’t “condemn” the media, adding it has led to a conversation. \n \n “It really don’t matter to me if you twist my words up,” Bundy said. “It matters that my heart goes out to the people of this world and they understand what I stand for.” \n \n Earlier on on Thursday, Bundy tried to clarify his comments on race, saying that he was just “wondering” whether black people would be better off as slaves. \n \n “I’m wondering if they’re better off under a government subsidy and their young women are having the abortions and their young men are in jail and their older women and children are sitting out on the cement porch without nothing to do,” the Nevada rancher said in a radio interview on The Peter Schiff Show. \n \n Bundy repeated similar comments at his afternoon press conference again asking whether black people would be happier in the South. \n \n Bundy caused outrage from figures on the right and left Thursday with statements on race first reported by The New York Times. \n \n On Schiff’s show, Bundy continued: “I’m wondering are they better off being slaves in that sense or better off being slaves to the United States government in the sense of the subsidy.

"['AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas will pay $3.4 million to a couple who were wrongfully imprisoned for more than two decades on prosecutors\' claims that they sexually abused children as part of satanic rituals at a day care they operated. \n \n Dan and Fran Keller learned Tuesday that they\'ll receive the payment from a state fund for the wrongly convicted, the Austin American-Statesman reported. \n \n A judge in June approved a request from Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore for a declaration of innocence for the Kellers. \n \n ""There was not enough evidence left,"" Moore said at the time, according to CBS affiliate KEYE. ""We work every day to insure that the cases we bring are appropriately brought and that\'s all I can answer is for what we do now."" \n \n The couple was convicted in 1992 of sexually assaulting a 3-year-old after children at the day care the Kellers operated out of their Austin home told investigators of dismembered babies, tortured pets and other fantastic tales. They were each sentenced to 48 years in prison. \n \n The Kellers were freed in 2013 after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found a doctor was mistaken in determining there was physical evidence of assault. The appeals court ruled deemed the doctor\'s testimony to be false, and the doctor himself also recanted it. \n \n Further bolstering the Kellers\' case was an interview the alleged victim provided in 2013 in which she acknowledged having no memory of being abused, Moore said in June. \n \n The determination of outright innocence made Dan Keller, 75, and Fran Keller, 67, each eligible for $80,000 in compensation for every year they were wrongfully imprisoned. They\'ll also receive a matching annuity that provides annual payments of 5 percent interest for as long as they\'re alive, according to the Statesman. \n \n ""This means we don\'t have to worry about pinching pennies on Social Security, and late bills. It means we will actually be free. We can start living -- and no more nightmares,"" Fran Keller told the newspaper. \n \n They\'ll look to buy a house, vehicle, health insurance and better hearing aids for Dan Keller. \n \n Their attorney, Keith Hampton, was not available to comment Wednesday, but he previously told the Associated Press that notorious claims of abuse at other U.S. day care centers were part of a hysteria that began in the 1980s about secretive cults targeting children. \n \n ""Day care panic or the satanic panic began to occur and it reached a fever pitch around the time the Kellers were prosecuted,"" Hampton said. ""And like most hysterias, it thereafter died away.""', 'Dan, Fran Keller were victims of ‘satanic panic’ that swept the nation in the early 1990s, their lawyer says. \n \n Dan and Fran Keller, who spent more than 21 years in prison after they were accused of sexually abusing children during supposed satanic rituals at their South Austin day care facility, will receive $3.4 million from a state fund for those wrongly convicted of crimes. \n \n Shortly after receiving the news Tuesday, an ecstatic Fran Keller said they will no longer have to live on the brink of destitution, unable to find jobs at their ages and with their convictions, even if overturned by the state’s highest criminal court. \n \n “This means we don’t have to worry about pinching pennies on Social Security, and late bills. It means we will actually be free. We can start living — and no more nightmares,” said Fran Keller, 67. \n \n Their to-do list includes buying a house, vehicle, health insurance and better hearing aids for Dan Keller, 75. \n \n The Kellers’ lawyer, Keith Hampton, said the couple will collect two checks totaling $3.44 million Wednesday at the state comptroller’s office, which administers the compensation fund. \n \n “They’re happy, and I’m happy for them,” said Hampton, who worked for no charge in getting the Kellers released and declared innocent. \n \n The Kellers received news of the payments as they stood outside the Williamson County Jail on Tuesday in support of Greg Kelley, who was to be released on bond. \n \n READ: Greg Kelley is released on bond from jail after 3-year legal slog \n \n Kelley, serving a 25-year sentence on a child sexual assault charge, has maintained his innocence and also is being represented by Hampton, who phoned the Kellers with news of the state payments while he was inside the jail arranging Kelley’s release. \n \n The state’s wrongful conviction compensation fund pays $80,000 for each year in prison, plus a matching annuity that provides annual payments of 5 percent interest as long as the recipient is alive and isn’t convicted of a felony. \n \n The Keller case made national news after three children accused them in 1991 of leading ghastly satanic rituals that supposedly included desecrated graves, videotaped orgies, dismembered babies and tortured pets. No evidence of such activities was discovered at their in-home day care facility, and the case against them collapsed about two decades later when the only physical evidence of abuse was acknowledged as a mistake by the examining physician. \n \n Freed on signature bonds in 2013, the Kellers launched an effort to clear their names. \n \n Hampton argued that the Kellers were the victims of “satanic panic” — a belief that swept the nation in the early 1990s that a national network of secretive cults was preying upon day care children for sex and other horrors. \n \n The Kellers also were harmed, he argued, by the combined efforts of inept therapists, gullible police and an investigation that spiraled out of control, producing a suspect list of 26 ritual abusers, including many of the Kellers’ neighbors and a respected Austin police captain. \n \n LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Our Lone Star Politics page brings Capitol news to your Facebook feed \n \n Children who reported no problems at the day care were ignored, and leading psychologists and criminology professors provided affidavits saying improper interview techniques and subtle encouragement by therapists produced believable-but-false memories in the children who accused the Kellers of abuse. \n \n Taped interviews of a Keller accuser, a 3-year-old girl, made at the Travis County sheriff’s office have since been used in lectures by a top specialist in assessing and treating crime victims to illustrate common interviewing mistakes. \n \n Travis County prosecutors, however, had pushed back, arguing that the Kellers failed to produce sufficient proof of innocence, such as an ironclad alibi or DNA evidence. \n \n In 2015, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals split the difference, overturning the Kellers’ convictions but declining to declare the couple innocent. \n \n The couple’s circumstances changed in June, when Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore filed court documents that dropped all charges and declared the Kellers “actually innocent” under the law. After an extensive review, it was clear that the Kellers’ innocence claim should be supported in the interest of justice, Moore said at the time. \n \n Now adults, several of the children who accused the Kellers opposed the move, according to Moore and family members.', 'AUSTIN (KXAN) — As attorney Keith Hampton was working to get his client Greg Kelley out of jail on Tuesday, he was also signing off on the compensation package for his other clients, Dan and Fran Keller, who were recently declared innocent in their case. \n \n The Kellers are entitled to $80,000 for each year they were incarcerated. In the couple’s case, they were in prison for 23 years, which means each person will receive approximately $1.84 million for their time served. The Tim Cole Act states half of the money will be paid as a lump sum and the other half will be paid out over their lifetime as an annuity. \n \n “They are now compensated and no longer must fear homelessness or lack of health insurance,” said Hampton in an email. “They are buying a home and can live out their lives in peace and quiet. I am very happy for them.” \n \n The couple was accused of satanic and ritual abuse of children in their care in the early 90s. A jury found them guilty and sentenced them to 48 years in prison. In 2013, a court ruled they didn’t get a fair trial and released them. \n \n In June of this year, Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore formally dismissed the cases against them. According to the motion to dismiss, there is “no credible evidence” that the Kellers, now 75 and 67 respectively, committed the crimes they were accused of, including sexually abusing the children at their day care in 1991. \n \n On the first day of Greg Kelley’s hearing earlier this month, the Kellers were in attendance to show their support. At his release on Tuesday, they too, were there again to meet him face-to-face for the first time.']",3,"– Dan and Fran Keller will receive $3.4 million from the state of Texas after being wrongly convicted of sexually abusing children during satanic rituals at their daycare and spending more than 21 years in prison, the Austin American-Statesman reports. According to CBS News, the Kellers were convicted in 1992 of sexually assaulting a 3-year-old girl and sentenced to 48 years in prison. They were released in 2013, had their convictions overturned in 2015, and were declared innocent in the eyes of the law in June. Since being released from prison, Fran Keller says it has been difficult to find work because of their ages—67 and 75—and wrongful imprisonment. “This means we don’t have to worry about pinching pennies ... and late bills,"" she says of the $3.4 million. ""It means we will actually be free. We can start living."" The Kellers found out they were receiving the money from a state fund for the wrongly convicted Tuesday and picked up their checks Wednesday. “They are now compensated and no longer must fear homelessness or lack of health insurance,” lawyer Keith Hampton tells KXAN. “They are buying a home and can live out their lives in peace and quiet."" The Kellers were accused by three children in 1991 of dismembering babies, torturing pets, and holding orgies at their daycare. The case against them fell apart two decades later when the doctor who found the only piece of physical evidence of abuse admitted it was the result of a mistake and recanted. The alleged victim also admitted she had no actual memory of being abused. Hampton says the couple fell victim to the ""satanic panic"" of the early 1990s."
"['CLOSE Police confirmed that two bodies found Tuesday were the missing teens from Carroll County: Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13. A search was called off Tuesday afternoon, when the bodies were found near Delphi.

Kim Riley said at a news conference shortly after 2 p.m. Tuesday. ""We suspect foul play."" \n \n Riley, Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby and Delphi Police Chief Steve Mullins refused to say much more than that. They noted the bodies were found about 12:15 p.m. about a half to three-quarters of a mile upstream from Monon High Bridge, which is part of the Delphi Historic Trails. \n \n The search parties for German and Williams ended when the bodies were found, said Amanda Leader from Brookston, who volunteered to look for the missing girls. \n \n German and Williams were dropped off at High Bridge, an abandoned railroad truss, about 1 p.m. Monday, but when a family arrived later in the afternoon to pick up the girls, they weren\'t there. Families members searched the area, then reported them missing at 5:30 p.m. Monday, according to Leazenby. \n \n Carroll Counth Sheriff Tobe Leaszenby, from left, Delphi Police Chief Steve Mullins and Sgt.

(Photo: John Terhune/Journal & Courier) \n \n Leazenby said the bridge spans Deer Creek. It is completely abandoned and has no guard rails. The bridge is listed as one of Indiana Landmark\'s 10 most endangered historic sites. \n \n A press release published at 12:09 a.m. Tuesday indicated police did not initially suspect foul play. Search parties regrouped Tuesday morning at the Delphi Fire Department to begin looking for the girls. \n \n Search parties scoured the base of the bridge and surrounding trails Monday night, but darkness made the searches nearly impossible, Leazenby said. \n \n ""With darkness last night, we probably didn\'t pick up on everything,"" he said. ""With daylight in our favor, we\'re sending folks back out to basically back track where we\'ve already been."" \n \n A specialized K-9 group from Macomb, Illinois, aided in the morning\'s search, Leazenby said Tuesday morning. \n \n Some asked why the police did not declare an Amber Alert when the girls were first reported missing. The sheriff\'s office was told the incident does not meet the criteria for an amber alert, Leazenby said. \n \n Journal & Courier reporter Ron Wilkins contributed to this story. \n \n Call J&C reporter Joseph Paul at 765-420-5339, email him at jpaul@jconline.com or follow him on Twitter: @JosephPaulJC. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.jconline.com/2lf6kpD', 'Two missing girls were found dead after they vanished while hiking along an abandoned railroad track in a small Indiana town on Monday. \n \n Police confirmed Wednesday the identities of the two bodies as Liberty “Libby” German, 14, and Abigail “Abby” Williams, 13, and say they are investigating the case as a double homicide. Police have still not released a cause of death. \n \n “This is considered a double homicide investigation, and no further information will be released at this time,” Indiana State Police Sergeant Kim Riley said Wednesday at a press conference. \n \n Later Wednesday, police released photos of a man they are seeking to identify in connection with the case. They have since said they consider him to be the main suspect in the killings. \n \n “We are asking help from the public to help identify him so he can be contacted regarding what he might have seen,” the Indiana State Police said in a press release. You can see the photos below: \n \n The photos were taken from Libby German’s phone, police said. They say she had the presence of mind to record video before her death. Authorities have also released a short audio clip of the suspect saying what they believe to be “down the hill.” You can listen to that clip below: \n \n On Tuesday, Riley said police suspected foul play and were investigating the area where the bodies were found as a crime scene, the Indianapolis Star reported. \n \n Riley said the suspicions arose because of “the way the bodies were found, that’s about all I can say at this time.” \n \n The bodies were found on the edge of the water, upstream, against the flow of the creek, police said. \n \n The girls, from Delphi, in Carroll County, were reported missing by their family on Monday. Hundreds of people, including police, firefighters, family, friends and residents of the surrounding community, searched for the girls into the night Monday and again Tuesday morning. The bodies were found about 12:15 p.m. Tuesday. \n \n The area is known as the Delphi Historic Trails. \n \n “Right now, we are following up on hundreds of hundreds of leads that have come in,” Riley said Wednesday. “There is nobody of interest at this point in time that we can say.” \n \n Police have set up a tip-line for information: 844-459-5786. \n \n Here’s what you need to know: \n \n 1. The Girls Were Dropped Off by Family & Were Reported Missing When They Didn’t Come to be Picked Up \n \n Abby Williams and Libby German were dropped off by family members at trails near the “Monon High Bridge” just east of their hometown of Delphi about 1 p.m. Monday, WTTV-TV reports. \n \n The middle school friends did not have class on Monday because of a snow-day built into the calendar, according to community members. \n \n The girls were supposed to be picked up by family later that afternoon, but did not show up, police said. They were reported missing about 5:30 p.m. \n \n A massive search of the area began, led by local and state police. A drone was used during the search and family members and friends of the girls assisted. A K-9 and dive team were also brought in to help find the girls. \n \n The Delphi Fire Department also assisted in the search, and their headquarters was used as a makeshift command center. \n \n “Having girls of our own, it just hit home,” one of the searchers, Karen Boucher, told the Logansport Pharos-Tribune. “We just wanted to do whatever we could.” \n \n Another searcher, Denise Hoverman, told the newspaper, “Nobody was even talking. It was very somber.” \n \n An Amber Alert was not issued because police said the case did not meet the criteria, which includes knowledge that a child under the age of 18 is in imminent danger and details about a vehicle or person possibly involved in the incident. The local news was notified and information about the girls was distributed online. \n \n “Even if we would have put an Amber Alert out, it wouldn’t have done this case any good,” Riley said at a press conference. “The short period of time and the location where the bodies were found, it would not have helped us in finding them.” \n \n Police initially said there was no foul play suspected, but that changed a day later. \n \n On Tuesday, police announced they found two bodies in Delphi, along Deer Creek, about a half mile from the railroad bridge where the girls had last been seen. \n \n “It’s been a long several hours,” Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby told reporters Tuesday afternoon. “It’s played tremendously on the emotions of this community.” \n \n Indiana State Police Sergeant Kim Riley told reporters, “One thing the family asked us to do is to thank the communities around Delphi and the people here in Delphi for assisting in attempting to locate the two young children who were missing here earlier. They just wanted to say thank you to those people and express their gratitude toward the hard work that was done in helping search for the children.” \n \n 2. They Posted a Final Photo on Snapchat While Hiking Along a Historic Railroad Bridge \n \n The girls posted an eerie final photo on Snapchat before they disappeared, according to WRTV. \n \n The photo, which you can see above, was posted about 2 p.m. It was taken by Liberty German and shows Abigail Williams walking along the railroad bridge. Liberty posted it to her Snapchat account. \n \n According to police and family members, the girls phones pinged in multiple locations but were shut off shortly after they were reported missing. \n \n A woman who was at the bridge commented on a Facebook post by a family member of one of the girls, saying she had been at the bridge shortly after the girls posted the photo. She said she didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. \n \n “I even walked all the way across the bridge and back. I only (saw) a guy when I first got there and another couple once I got on the bridge,” Cheyenne Mekisha Engles wrote. “I didn’t see the girls at all. I also didn’t take the trail that leads to the right. Only took the trail that lead to the bridge.” \n \n The bridge where the girls were hiking is known as a popular spot in the Delphi area. It appears to have been an area where the girls had been before. \n \n Abigail’s mom, Anna Williams, has a photo of the bridge as her Facebook cover photo. That photo was already in place before her daughter went missing. \n \n Another photo on her Facebook page shows Abigail fishing in the creek with the bridge in the background. \n \n 3. Community Members Expressed Concern Over the Lack of Details About the Case Released by Police \n \n Some community members in the small town of about 3,000 people have expressed concerned to local media about the lack of details released by police after the bodies were found. \n \n Officials from the Indiana State Police, Delphi Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office both told reporters they were not able to share much information because of the ongoing investigation. \n \n A press conference Tuesday afternoon was filled with vague statements from police spokesmen. \n \n “We don’t have much at this time,” State Police Sergeant Kim Riley said at the press conference. “The Indiana State Police is assisting the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office and the Delphi City Police in the investigation here. We also have the FBI crime scene investigation group here out of Indianapolis.” \n \n “We don’t really want to put out too much information at this point of time,” he said. I know we’re not giving you much, I understand that. But we’re at the baby stages of this case. At this point of time I cannot release really much more information. As soon as I can, I will be more than happy to put stuff out.” \n \n Riley said he was not “at liberty” to give a description of the bodies found in Deer Creek, and also would not say who found the bodies. He also would not give further information about the condition of the bodies and whether they had been injured. \n \n When asked if there was a suspect or person of interest being questioned, Riley replied, “We have not gotten that far into the investigation so I cannot comment on that one way or the other.” \n \n Police were also asked if people in the community should be afraid. \n \n “I think people are smart enough in our community to draw their own conclusions about what they should feel and shouldn’t feel,” Delphi Police Chief Steve Mullin replied. “Our people are very smart. They are a very good community and they are very strong. And they are able to draw their own conclusions about this whole situation I think quite successfully.” \n \n The reporter clarified that he asked the question because some may be concerned when they hear the words “foul play suspected” that there may be somebody “preying on people that they need to be afraid of.” \n \n Mullin said he “understands” what he is saying, and again responded, “I think people are able to draw their own conclusions about this situation, and they’re smart enough to figure out what this situation warrants them to think. That’s all we have to say about that.” \n \n You can watch the full police press conference below: \n \n A local parent, Jennifer Robinson, was asked by the Lafayette Journal & Courier if she feels safe. \n \n “Not particularly, to be honest with you, and I’ve got three kids,” Robinson told the newspaper. “To me it’s kind of a big deal.” \n \n Dennis Walker, another Delphi resident, told the newspaper, “There’s a lot of blowing up going on at Facebook. A lot of angry people. A lot of other people saying we got to pray for the family, do what we can. \n \n “A lot of people go out there for a little hiking, a nice day in the woods, get a little exercise. This shouldn’t happen to you when you go out there,” he said. \n \n Julia Leahy told the Journal-Courier, it’s going to “take this community a long time” to get over this. \n \n Melissa Schwartz told WRTV, “I think it’s very scary, I was raised in Delphi, grew up in Delphi and we’ve never had anything like this happen in Delphi, so it’s very concerning.” \n \n While police have not called it a homicide investigation, some in the community have jumped to conclusions. \n \n “I would always be concerned about that until they find whatever murderous beast did this. I would watch my kids very carefully,” Kevin Kologinski told WRTV. “Mine are all grown up, my grandchildren are too young to be off on their own, but for any other kids that are out I’d keep a very close eye.” \n \n 4. The Girls Were Both Students at Delphi Community Middle School \n \n The girls were both students at the Delphi Community Middle School. \n \n “It is with heavy hearts that the school corporation day comes to an end. It is our understanding that the two bodies found today were those of our two missing Delphi Community Middle School students,” the school district said in a statement to WRTV. \n \n School officials said they plan to have counselors and pastors available for those who need them on Wednesday. The school will open as normal. \n \n Teenagers gathered outside the town’s firehouse on Tuesday after word spread about the bodies that were found, the Lafayette Journal & Courier reported. \n \n A vigil was held Tuesday night at the Delphi United Methodist Church, according to the Pharos-Tribune. \n \n Community members prayed for the families of the two girls, along with first responders, teachers and students. The service include readings from the book of Matthew. \n \n “The people that participated in the search and the people who have made every effort to find the victims in this case, it’s much appreciated,” Delphi Police Chief Steve Mullin told the newspaper at the vigil. “I know this has had a terrible effect on our people, and I am pleased to see the community come out and help us in every way they have. I’m proud to be a part of this community.” \n \n 5. Police Say They Are Confident They Will ‘Get to the Bottom of This’ \n \n Sergeant Kim Riley said on Twitter that investigators were still working at the crime scene late Tuesday evening. \n \n An autopsy was completed Wednesday morning, and police confirmed Williams and German were the victims of a double homicide. Authorities have not released a cause of death, and say further testing, including toxicology reports, are still being completed. \n \n “There is someone out there that did this crime and we’re going to track them down,” Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby told reporters. “Folks should continue with business as usual but be more mindful and watch your surroundings a little closer. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, we feel confident.” \n \n Riley said parents should keep an eye on their children. \n \n “I think people need to be cautious and careful,” Riley said. “Parents should make sure they know where their children are and what their children are doing, and if nothing else, know what’s going on in their lives. That’s the most important thing I can say at this point in time.” \n \n “We are asking for anyone to come forward with information or were in the area of the Delphi Historic Trails or Monon High Bridge that might have seen a person or persons, vehicles parked in the area or were taking pictures,” Indiana State Police said in a press release. “Any information may be helpful to solving this case. You can contact the Carroll County Sheriff’s Department or the Delphi Police Department at 765-564-2413, option #1, or the Indiana State Police at 765-567-2125. \n \n “Also, if you were parked at High Bridge Trail Head on February 13, 2017 between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. we would like to talk to you,” police said.', 'UPDATE: Authorities positively identified the two bodies found as Abigail ""Abby"" Williams,13, and Liberty ""Libby"" German,14. \n \n DELPHI, Ind. -- An hour after Delphi Assistant Fire Chief Curtis Borden told RTV6 two missing 13-year-old girls from Carroll County were found, calling it ""not good,"" authorities said at a press conference two bodies had been found in the area the girls went missing. \n \n Sergeant Kim Riley with the Indiana State Police wouldn\'t go so far as to identify the bodies as the girls in a press conference Tuesday, but they do suspect foul play. \n \n New Tip Line has been setup for information regarding deaths of Liberty Germa & Abigail Williams.

"['An advertisement revealing how alcohol absorbs into bloodstreams and can cause cancer is the most effective alcohol education ad internationally, a Cancer Council Victoria suggests. \n \n ‘Spread’, created by The Brand Agency in 2010 for the Western Australia Alcohol and Drug Office, shows how drinking too much alcohol could heighten risks of cell mutations and cause cancer. \n \n Published in the British Medical Journal Open, the study compared 83 alcohol education advertisements around the world, with ‘Spread’ reported as the most likely to motivate drinkers to reduce alcohol consumption. \n \n The study involved 2,174 adults who regularly consume alcohol. The study subjects were shown three randomly selected ads from the pool of options before reporting the extent to which they felt motivated to reduce drinking following the viewing. \n \n Each advertisement was scored on a five-point scale, with one being lowest and five being highest motivation. \n \n ‘Spread’ received a score of 3.77, performing best among male and females, all ages, as well as low and high-risk drinkers. \n \n Todd Harper, Cancer Council Victoria’s CEO said the research shows how campaigns can be used to help inform the public of the long-term consequences of alcohol consumption. \n \n “We’ve seen how effective campaigns around drink driving and short-term harms such as injury or violence have been in terms of changing our drinking habits, but in Victoria and the majority of the rest of Australia, we rarely see the long-term health effects of alcohol portrayed on our screens,” he said. \n \n “This research highlights how effective a campaign like this could be in terms of motivating people to better understand the risks of alcohol consumption. \n \n “These findings should now be used to plan campaigns that empower the community with knowledge about the harms of alcohol, so they can reduce their cancer risk.” \n \n The study was conducted by the Cancer Council’s Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer and funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council. \n \n Cancer Council Victoria hopes to use the advertisement in a campaign later this year. \n \n Nine’s Today Show Extra this morning built on Harper’s comments, discussing whether alcohol packaging could or should go in the same direction as cigarette advertising, following the study’s revelations.', 'Known and Probable Human Carcinogens \n \n Many people worry that substances or exposures in their environment may cause cancer. As part of the American Cancer Society’s role in informing and educating people about cancer and its possible causes, this document provides lists of substances and exposures that are known or suspected to cause cancer. The lists below have been developed by two highly respected agencies – the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US National Toxicology Program (NTP). Some related information is included on how these and other agencies and groups test and classify possible carcinogens. \n \n The American Cancer Society does not keep detailed information on each of the exposures on these lists. If you are looking for more in-depth information on a particular item on these lists, please refer to the agencies in the “Additional resources” section. \n \n What is a carcinogen? \n \n Cancer is caused by changes in a cell’s DNA – its genetic “blueprint.” Some of these changes may be inherited from our parents. Others may be caused by outside exposures, which are often referred to as environmental factors. Environmental factors can include a wide range of exposures, such as: \n \n Lifestyle factors (nutrition, tobacco use, physical activity, etc.) \n \n Naturally occurring exposures (ultraviolet light, radon gas, infectious agents, etc.) \n \n Medical treatments (radiation and medicines including chemotherapy, hormone drugs, drugs that suppress the immune system, etc.) \n \n Workplace exposures \n \n Household exposures \n \n Pollution \n \n Substances and exposures that can lead to cancer are called carcinogens. Some carcinogens do not affect DNA directly, but lead to cancer in other ways. For example, they may cause cells to divide at a faster than normal rate, which could increase the chances that DNA changes will occur. \n \n Carcinogens do not cause cancer in every case, all the time. Substances labeled as carcinogens may have different levels of cancer-causing potential. Some may cause cancer only after prolonged, high levels of exposure. And for any particular person, the risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including how they are exposed to a carcinogen, the length and intensity of the exposure, and the person\'s genetic makeup. \n \n How do researchers determine if something is a carcinogen? \n \n Testing to see if something can cause cancer is often difficult. It is not ethical to test a substance by exposing people to it and seeing if they get cancer from it. That’s why scientists must use other types of tests, which may not always give clear answers. \n \n Lab studies \n \n Scientists get much of their data about whether something might cause cancer from lab studies in cell cultures and animals. There are far too many substances (both natural and man-made) to test each one in lab animals, so scientists use what is already known about chemical structures, results from other types of lab tests, the extent of human exposure, and other factors to select chemicals for testing. For example, they can often get an idea about whether a substance might cause a problem by comparing it to similar chemicals that have already been studied. \n \n Although lab studies alone can\'t always predict if a substance will cause cancer in people, virtually all known human carcinogens that have been adequately tested also cause cancer in lab animals. In many cases, carcinogens are first found to cause cancer in lab animals and are later found to cause cancer in people. \n \n Most studies of potential carcinogens expose the lab animals to doses that are much higher than common human exposures. This is so that cancer risk can be detected in relatively small groups of animals. It is not always clear if the results from animal studies will be the same for people as they are normally exposed to a substance. For example, the effects seen in lab studies with very high doses of a substance may not be the same at much lower doses, or the effects of a substance when it is inhaled may not be the same as if it is applied to the skin. Also, the bodies of lab animals and humans don\'t always process substances in the same way. \n \n But for safety reasons, it is usually assumed that exposures that cause cancer at larger doses in animals may also cause cancer in people. It isn\'t always possible to know how the exposure dose might affect risk, but it is reasonable for public health purposes to assume that lowering human exposure will reduce risk. \n \n Studies in people \n \n Another important way to identify carcinogens is through epidemiologic studies, which look at human populations to determine which factors might be linked to cancer. These studies also provide useful information, but they have their limits. Humans do not live in a controlled environment. People are exposed to many substances at any given time, including those they encounter at work, school, or home; in the food they eat; and in the air they breathe. It\'s very unlikely they know exactly what they\'ve been exposed to or that they would be able to remember all of their exposures if asked by a researcher. And there are usually many years (often decades) between exposure to a carcinogen and the development of cancer. Therefore, it can be very hard to definitely link any particular exposure to cancer. \n \n By combining data from both types of studies, scientists do their best to make an educated assessment of a substance\'s cancer-causing ability. When the evidence is conclusive, the substance is labeled as a carcinogen. When the available evidence is compelling but not felt to be conclusive, the substance may be considered to be a probable carcinogen. But in some cases there simply isn\'t enough information to be certain one way or the other. \n \n Who determines how carcinogens are classified? \n \n Several national and international agencies are responsible for determining the cancer-causing potential of different substances. \n \n International Agency for Research on Cancer \n \n The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). One of its major goals is to identify causes of cancer. The most widely used system for classifying carcinogens comes from the IARC. In the past 30 years, the IARC has evaluated the cancer-causing potential of more than 900 likely candidates, placing them into one of the following groups: \n \n Group 1: Carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group 2A: Probably carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group 2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group 3: Unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans \n \n Group 4: Probably not carcinogenic to humans \n \n Perhaps not surprisingly, based on how hard it can be to test these candidate carcinogens, most are listed as being of probable, possible, or unknown risk. Only a little over 100 are classified as “carcinogenic to humans.” \n \n National Toxicology Program \n \n The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is formed from parts of several different US government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NTP updates its Report on Carcinogens (RoC) every few years. \n \n The Report on Carcinogens identifies 2 groups of agents: \n \n “Known to be human carcinogens” \n \n “Reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens” \n \n The current version of the RoC lists about 250 substances and exposures. Unlike the IARC’s list, the RoC does not list substances that have been studied and found not to be carcinogens. \n \n Environmental Protection Agency \n \n The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), an electronic database that contains information on human health effects from exposure to certain substances in the environment. The EPA uses a rating system similar to that of IARC when describing the cancer-causing potential of a substance: \n \n Group A: Carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group B: Likely to be carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group C: Suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential \n \n Group D: Inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential \n \n Group E: Not likely to be carcinogenic to humans \n \n Other agencies and groups \n \n Other federal agencies, such as the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) may comment on whether a substance or exposure may cause cancer and/or what levels of exposure to a particular substance might be considered acceptable. \n \n Some state agencies also keep lists of known or probable carcinogens. For example, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) maintains a list of “chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.” (Much of this list is based on the IARC and NTP lists below.) \n \n The American Cancer Society’s role \n \n The American Cancer Society (ACS) contributes in many ways to evaluating how environmental factors affect a person\'s likelihood of developing cancer, including: \n \n Conducting epidemiologic research on the causes of cancer \n \n Funding laboratory and epidemiologic research at universities and other institutions that study environmental causes of cancer \n \n Advocating for environmental health on local, state, and federal levels \n \n Informing the public about environmental factors that affect cancer risk and how to decrease their risk of developing cancer \n \n In most cases, the ACS does not directly evaluate whether a certain substance or exposure causes cancer. Instead, the ACS looks to national and international organizations such as the NTP and IARC, whose mission is to evaluate environmental cancer risks based on evidence from laboratory and human research studies. \n \n Some important points about the IARC and NTP lists here \n \n The IARC and NTP act independently but have studied many of the same agents, so many known or suspected carcinogens appear on both lists. But because an agent appears on one and not on the other does not necessarily mean there is a controversy, as one agency may not have evaluated it. \n \n Unfortunately, many of the substances and exposures on the lists below can often go by different names. This can make it hard to find a particular substance on one or both of these lists, which are in alphabetical order and may not always use the most common term. \n \n These lists include only those agents that have been evaluated by the agencies. These agencies tend to focus on substances and exposures most likely to cause cancer, but there are many others that have not been studied fully yet. \n \n Most of the agents on the lists have been linked only with certain kinds of cancer, not all types. For more detailed information, refer to the specific monographs or reports published by the agencies (available on their websites). \n \n The lists describe the level of evidence that something can cause cancer, not how likely it is that something will cause cancer in any particular person. For example, IARC considers there to be strong evidence that both tobacco smoking and eating processed meat can cause cancer, so both are listed as “carcinogenic to humans.” But smoking is much more likely to cause cancer than eating processed meat, even though both are in the same category. \n \n Carcinogens do not cause cancer at all times, under all circumstances. Some may only be carcinogenic if a person is exposed in a certain way (for example, swallowing it as opposed to touching it). Some may only cause cancer in people who have a certain genetic makeup. Some of these agents may lead to cancer after only a very small exposure, while others might require intense exposure over many years. Again, you should refer to the agencies’ reports for specifics. \n \n Even if a substance or exposure is known or suspected to cause cancer, this does not necessarily mean that it can or should be avoided at all costs. For example, estrogen is a known carcinogen that occurs naturally in the body. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight is also known to cause cancer, but it’s not practical (or advisable) to completely avoid the sun. These lists also include many commonly used medicines, particularly some hormones and drugs used to treat cancer. For example, tamoxifen increases the risk of certain kinds of uterine cancer but can be very useful in treating some breast cancers, which may be more important for some women. If you have questions about a medicine that appears on one of these lists, be sure to ask your doctor. \n \n Looking at the list below can tell you whether or not something may increase your risk of cancer, but it is important to try to get an idea of how much it might increase your risk. It is also important to know what your risk is to begin with. Many factors can enter into this, including your age, gender, family history, and lifestyle factors (tobacco and alcohol use, weight, diet, physical activity level, etc.). As noted above, the type and extent of exposure to a substance may also play a role. You should consider the actual amount of increased risk when deciding if you should limit or avoid an exposure. \n \n Known human carcinogens \n \n International Agency for Research on Cancer \n \n

Please try again later.', ""Given limited resources, it is crucial that funding is devoted to messages with the greatest likelihood of promoting behaviour change. Perceived effectiveness measures are often used to pretest the likely success of potential campaign messages, with several studies on tobacco control messages establishing their predictive validity for increased intentions to quit, 39 more thoughts about quitting 40 and behaviour change. 41 , 42 A recent review defined perceived effectiveness as “the extent to which a message recipient believes that a health message will affect him or her personally in terms of the particular message objectives”. 43 As a step towards identifying specific advertisements (ads) and message features that may hold the most promise for population-wide behaviour change, the primary aim of the study was to examine the comparative perceived effectiveness of a large pool of alcohol harm reduction ads with variable features, using a measure of the extent to which adult weekly drinkers felt motivated by them to reduce the amount of alcohol they drink. A secondary aim was to determine the top-ranked ads for drinkers overall compared with high-risk drinkers and other key demographic subgroups, providing a preliminary test of the merit of a ‘common denominator’ approach. A third aim was to identify the informational content, executional style and other message features associated with highly ranked ads. \n \n Several recent successful examples of alcohol harm reduction advertising also suggest that a general population, rather than targeted audience, approach may hold promise. 33 , 34 Conceptualised more generally, mass media campaigns can either target messages to particular subgroups (typically high-risk individuals or key demographic groups) or use a whole-of-population approach. While targeting campaigns to subgroups holds logical appeal, others have noted that this approach also carries risks. A focus on particular high-risk population subgroups (such as young adults) can exempt people outside those groups (such as older adults) from heeding the message even though they may also be at risk, promoting a culture in which ‘our’ drinking is acceptable and ‘their’ drinking is problematic. 35 , 36 Relatedly, campaigns that are narrowly targeted miss the opportunity to change broader social norms by encouraging the wider population to reflect on their own behaviour and generating wider public debate that can build support for policy change. 36 , 37 Finally, narrowly targeted campaigns can be inefficient, requiring multiple messages for different groups which are expensive to develop and sustain. 36 As Hornik and colleagues have suggested, there may be merit in adopting a ‘common denominator’ approach, 36 , 38 where a single campaign is used to address beliefs that are commonly shared across many subgroups, thus serving multiple audiences at the same time. Such an approach also provides the opportunity to stimulate broader community discussion and normative change. \n \n One means for achieving improved awareness could be through the delivery of mass media campaigns that warn the public of the negative consequences of alcohol use. Mass media campaigns have been successful for changing many health behaviours, 13 most notably in reducing tobacco use. 14 , 15 Yet aside from the success of campaigns to reduce drink driving 16 there is limited evidence to date that alcohol harm reduction campaigns—most of which have focussed on youth—are effective. 13 , 17 , 18 This limited success could be due to many factors, 13 including inadequate reach, frequency and duration, the lack of integration of public education with a sustained comprehensive approach involving other alcohol control policies including price controls 17 , 19 and the unrestricted volume of pro-drinking alcohol marketing which dwarfs sporadic educational efforts. 19 , 20 Integration of policy and public education efforts is typified in the successful whole-of-population approach in tobacco control that has changed social norms and reduced adult and youth smoking rates. 13 , 15 , 21–26 Evidence from tobacco control has also demonstrated that message attributes are more important than audience attributes in identifying effective campaigns, 14 , 27 with particular campaign messages—such as those promoting why people need to quit rather than how to quit and those that evoke negative emotion through graphic imagery or personal stories of serious harm—performing well across many population subgroups. 14 , 27–32 \n \n Alcohol use ranks among the top five risk factors for global disease burden, accounting for 5.5% of all disability adjusted life years lost. 1 About 70% of this alcohol burden is due to long-term harms such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric disorders and infectious disease, with the remainder due to short-term harms including unintentional and intentional injury. 2 In developed nations such as Australia, the UK, Ireland and the USA, population awareness of the range of harms from alcohol is limited. 3–8 For example, an Australian survey in 2014 found prompted awareness of the link between alcohol use and serious conditions to vary substantially, ranging from 80% for cirrhosis of the liver to only 15% for breast cancer. 9 Population surveys also show poor awareness of the levels of alcohol consumption associated with harm 10 and low-risk drinking guidelines. 9 , 11 Together, these findings indicate considerable scope for public education to improve awareness and understanding of alcohol-associated harms, with the broader goal of contributing to reductions in risky drinking. A keener awareness of harms is also critical if strong public support is to be expected for alcohol policy reform. 12 \n \n We used Fisher's exact tests to compare the characteristics of ads that were ranked in the top 15% (n=12 ads) with those ranked in the middle 70% (n=59) and the bottom 15% (n=12) within the overall sample. Fifteen per cent (n=12 ads) was chosen as the cut-off for the sets of top-ranked/bottom-ranked ads, as this provided a balance between having a sufficient number of ads to give stable estimates of the characteristics within each group while also limiting the number of ads to be considered by campaign planners wishing to select one of the top performing for use in their own jurisdiction. \n \n Data were analysed using Stata/SE 14.2 (StataCorp. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14.2. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP; 2016). Multivariable linear regression models provided predicted means on the outcome of ‘motivated to reduce the amount of alcohol I drink’ for each ad, and assessed the statistical significance of differences between each ad and (1) the highest and then (2) the lowest ranked ad. One set of models was conducted for the overall sample (N=6522 unique ad ratings). Additional models were conducted stratified by demographic subgroups to examine differences in participants' ad rankings by age group (younger adults (n=3513 unique ad ratings) and older adults (n=3009)), sex (men (n=3123) and women (n=3999)) and drinking risk status (low risk (n=3327) and high risk (n=3195)). All models (overall sample and stratified models) employed data that were clustered by participant identification number to account for the same individual rating three ads using the cluster option in Stata, whereby robust SEs are used to allow for intragroup correlation. All models controlled for participant characteristics used for sample recruitment quotas and/or that were significantly associated with the outcome in bivariate models: NHMRC risk status (in four categories, as described above), perceived risk status, sex, tertiary education, parental status, age (continuous), familiarity with the ads, past 7 day alcohol consumption and alcohol identity. \n \n Participants were asked one question about their perceived level of risk (adapted from 49 ): How would you describe the amount of alcohol you currently drink? Response options included: (1) ‘I definitely drink more than I should’; (2) ‘I probably drink more than I should’; (3) ‘The amount I drink is ok’ and (4) ‘I could drink more than I do’. Response options (1) and (2) were combined and classified as ‘at risk’; responses (3) and (4) were combined and classified as ‘low risk’. Two questions measured the importance of alcohol to the individual's self-identity (adapted from studies measuring the importance of tobacco smoking to self-identity 50 , 51 ): ‘drinking is part of who I am’ and ‘drinking is a part of my personality’. Responses were assessed using a five-point scale (1 ‘strongly disagree’—5 ‘strongly agree’), and were averaged to form a two-item measure of alcohol identity (α=0.904). \n \n Baseline alcohol consumption was first assessed using the graduated quantity frequency measure, 10 a measure of average pattern of consumption based on how often in the past 12 months (every day, 5–6 days a week, 3–4 days a week, 1–2 days a week, 2–3 days a month, about 1 day a month, less often or never) participants had each of the following number of standard drinks in a day (20+, 11–19, 7–10, 5–6, 3–4, 1–2, <1 or no alcohol in a day). A standard drink in Australia is classified as 10g of alcohol, 47 and to aid accurate responses participants were provided with a visual guide of the number of standard drinks in common serving sizes of different alcoholic beverages. Applying the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) 2009 guidelines for low-risk drinking, 48 participants were classified as being at high risk of short-term harm if they reported having >4 drinks on any occasion at least once a month, and as being at high risk of long-term harm if they consumed >2 drinks per day on average. Participants were further classified into one of four categories: (1) low risk of harm in the short term and long term; (2) high risk of short-term harm but low risk of long-term harm; (3) low risk of short-term harm but high risk of long-term harm or (4) high risk of harm in the short term and long term. For comparative analyses, these categories were aggregated to compare those at low risk in the short term and long term (1; ‘low-risk drinkers’) with those at high risk in either or both the short term or long term (2, 3, 4; ‘high-risk drinkers’). Consumption was also measured using the seven-day timeline follow-back method, 48 to provide an estimate of recent consumption, whereby participants indicate how many alcoholic standard drinks they consumed each day of the past week, with each day and date labelled automatically in the online survey depending on the date of study completion. \n \n After viewing each ad, participants completed a set of questions assessing their cognitive and emotional responses. In the current study, we focussed on the primary outcome of motivation to reduce the amount of alcohol consumed. This was determined by asking participants to indicate on a five-point scale (1 ‘strongly disagree’–5 ‘strongly agree’) the extent to which they ‘felt motivated to reduce the amount of alcohol I drink’ while watching the ad. Self-reported motivation to engage in behaviour change was part of the personalised perceived effectiveness scale validated as a predictor of subsequent behaviour change following exposure to tobacco control ads, 42 and is consistent with recent recommendations that the potential effectiveness of behaviour change messages be assessed by asking participants to report how likely it is that they will be personally affected in the way intended by the message. 43 There were moderate to strong positive correlations, ranging from 0.51 to 0.72, between this overarching general drinking reduction motivation and other more specific motivations, namely being motivated to: limit my drinking so I don't get drunk; behave responsibly when I drink; look after my friends and family when they are drinking; talk to a friend or family member about their drinking; limit my drinking when around children and teenagers; never supply alcohol to teenagers and (among parents) talk to my children about alcohol. These seven items were developed specifically for the study, and were intended to cover the full spectrum of behavioural objectives targeted by these ads, as identified in our recent content analysis. 45 The correlation results suggest that while different ads may seek to influence particular behaviours, if they are successful in doing so, they also elicit an overall motivation to reduce the amount of alcohol a person drinks. We therefore used this general reduced drinking motivational outcome as our primary ranking criterion; however, in a supplementary report, we present findings for all seven motivation items, to assist jurisdictions to select messages with the greatest potential to motivate adult drinkers to engage in a range of behaviours to reduce harm from alcohol. 46 \n \n Panel members were invited to participate via email with a web link to the study. Potential participants first completed questions assessing qualifying criteria and quotas. Prior to viewing ads, eligible participants were informed that some ads may be from different countries and that when watching each ad they should focus on its main message and imagery, rather than production quality or cultural differences such as accents. Participants were then shown their first ad twice, and asked to complete a series of ad ratings. This process was repeated for the remaining two ads randomly assigned to the participant. \n \n While others have shown through modelling that stable ad ratings can be achieved with as few as 23 individuals rating each ad, 44 we set our target higher since random assignment of ads to participants meant some variability in the exact number of individuals rating each ad. We aimed for a sample size of 70 ratings per ad to facilitate comparisons of ad ratings within the key demographic subgroups of men/women (35 ratings per ad) and younger/older adults (35 ratings per ad). \n \n The sample comprised 2174 18–64 year olds who reported consuming alcohol at least 1–2 days per week on average over the past 12 months (‘weekly drinkers’). 10 Participants were ineligible if they were pregnant or worked in health promotion, market research, advertising or the alcohol industry. Participants were recruited through an online panel that was accredited under the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) standards for access panels in market, opinion and social research (AS ISO 26362). Quotas were applied to achieve approximately even numbers of men and women, and those aged 18–29 years (younger adults) and 30–64 years (older adults). \n \n In an online study, Australian adult drinkers viewed and responded to three alcohol harm reduction television ads randomly selected from a pool of 83 ads. The study design minimised the possibility of order effects via random selection of ads from the pool and presenting them in a random order to each participant. The final rating obtained for each ad was aggregated across individuals and across orderings, and therefore controlled for order effects. Fieldwork was undertaken in October–November 2015. \n \n While top-ranked ads did not differ in their use of graphic imagery, they were more likely than bottom-ranked ads to contain explicit portrayals of drinking (58% vs 8%, respectively) and were less likely to contain no portrayal of drinking than middle-ranked or bottom-ranked ads (0% vs 25% and 75%, respectively). Finally, a significantly higher proportion of top-ranked ads targeted a general adult audience (83%), whereas middle-ranked (46%) and bottom-ranked ads (58%) were more likely to specifically target young adults ( table 4 ). \n \n The distribution of ads differed by emotional tone, with 50% of bottom-ranked ads having a positive tone compared with none of the top-ranked ads. Conversely, 92% of top-ranked ads had a negative tone compared with 50% of bottom-ranked ads, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=.085). In terms of execution, top-ranked ads were less likely to feature a dramatisation communication style (67% compared with 100% of bottom-ranked ads). While top-ranked ads appeared more likely than others to use simulation/animation (25%), this difference was not statistically significant. \n \n We compared the characteristics of the top-ranked 15% of ads in the overall sample with the characteristics of the middle-ranked 70% and bottom-ranked 15% of ads ( table 4 ). Regarding the key communication intent of the ad, the distribution of ads containing a ‘why change behaviour’ intent was significantly different across the three groups, with all of the top-ranked ads carrying a ‘why’ message but only half of the bottom-ranked ads doing so. In addition, 58% of the top-ranked ads featured information on the long-term harms of alcohol consumption, compared with 7% of middle-ranked ads and none of the bottom-ranked ads. (Not shown in table 4 , seven of the top-ranked ads featured information on long-term harms. Of these seven ads, six mentioned cancer, four mentioned stroke, two mentioned heart disease, two mentioned high blood pressure, one mentioned liver disease and one ad mentioned other non-specific ‘serious health problems’. In addition, of the four middle-ranked ads that featured long-term harms, cancer was mentioned in three and other non-specific ‘serious health problems’ were mentioned in one). A higher proportion of all top-ranked ads presented low-risk drinking guidelines (58%) compared with the middle-ranked (5%) and bottom-ranked ads (0%). \n \n We assessed the degree of consistency in ad rankings across subgroups in two ways. First, we examined which ads were in the top-ranked 15% within each subgroup and the extent to which these overlapped with the top-ranked 15% for the overall sample ( table 3 ). Of the 12 ads that were top ranked in the overall sample, six were also top ranked among younger adults, nine were top ranked by older adults, seven were top ranked by men, eight were top ranked by women, ten were top ranked by low-risk drinkers and eight were top ranked by high-risk drinkers. More specifically, the ad ranked highest overall—Spread—was also ranked in the number one or two positions within each audience subgroup. Similarly, the second highest ranked ad overall—What you can't see—was ranked in second, third or fourth place in all subgroups except the low-risk drinkers (for whom it ranked 10th). The third highest ranked ad overall—Danny—was ranked in the top two or three in all subgroups except men (among whom it ranked 9th). We also examined the Spearman rank order correlation between the rankings of all 83 ads across the age, sex and risky drinking subgroups. The rank order of the 83 ads between the younger and older adults was significantly correlated, r s (81)=0.42, p<0.001. Similarly, the rank order of the 83 ads between men and women was significantly correlated, r s (81)=0.45, p<0.001, and so was the rank order of the 83 ads between low-risk and high-risk drinkers, r s (81)=0.46, p<0.001. \n \n With a mean score of 3.77, the highest ranked ad was Spread, developed and funded by the Western Australian state government as part of their Alcohol and cancer mass media campaign. Ads ranked in the second to seventh positions—What you can't see (M=3.62) from the same Western Australian campaign, Danny (M=3.57) from New Zealand's Not the drinking campaign, Male (M=3.51) from the UK's Damage you can't see campaign, Could happen to you (M=3.45) also from the Western Australian Alcohol and cancer campaign, Female (M=3.44) from the Damage you can't see campaign and Change4Life (M=3.44) from the UK—all performed comparably with Spread in that they did not score significantly differently on the motivation outcome. From the eighth-ranked ad onwards, adjusted mean scores were significantly lower than for Spread. With a mean score of 2.42, the lowest ranked ad was Add nothing from the Not beersies campaign from New Zealand. Ads ranked in positions 81 and 82—Nails (M=2.64) and Piercings (M=2.69), both from Singapore's When to stop campaign—did not perform significantly better than Add nothing, whereas ads in position 80 and higher all scored significantly better than Add nothing ( table 2 ). \n \n Around half of participants (46%) were classified as high risk for short-term alcohol-related harm and 31% were classified as high risk for long-term harm. When combined into the four-category variable, 51% were classified as low risk for short-term and long-term harm, 18% were at high risk of short-term harm but low risk of long-term harm, 3% were at low risk of short-term harm but high risk of long-term harm and 28% were at high risk of short-term and long-term harm ( table 1 ). When further aggregated for comparative analysis, overall 49% were high-risk drinkers (at risk of short-term and/or long-term harm) and the remaining 51% were low-risk drinkers. Risk proportions were similar to those calculated for adult weekly drinkers sourced from the 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS). 10 The proportion of 18–29 year olds in the sample (54%) was higher than in the NDSHS due to the use of age quotas during study recruitment. However, the sample was largely comparable with the NDSHS sample in terms of sex, residential location, SES, tertiary education and parental status ( table 1 ). \n \n Discussion \n \n The first aim of the study was to rank a large pool of alcohol harm reduction ads according to the extent to which adult weekly drinkers felt motivated by them to reduce their own alcohol consumption. Although motivation responses for all ads were within the middle range of the five-point scale (2.42–3.77), we identified several specific ads that topped the list and also identified the top-ranked 15% of ads and the message characteristics that significantly distinguished these from lower ranked ads. Campaign messages that drinkers found most motivating were those that directly communicated why change was advisable or necessary, rather than how to achieve such change, a finding consistent with that from tobacco control14 ,30 and obesity prevention.53 Top-ranked ads were also more likely to address long-term harms, conditions that are likely to reflect where most alcohol educational deficits exist.54 Emotional tone of the ads also differed across the three ranked categories, with ads featuring a positive tone more likely to be in the bottom-ranked 15% and top-ranked ads tending to be more likely to have a negative emotional tone (albeit not reaching statistical significance). This pattern of findings is broadly consistent with a recent small study of drinkers in the UK which found negative emotion mediated the effects of alcohol harm reduction ads on lower urges to drink.34 Inclusion of low-risk guidelines or recommendations was also more likely in top-ranked ads, suggesting this message element may have potency. Furthermore, although rankings varied somewhat, there was substantial overlap in the top-ranked ads across key demographic groups of younger and older adults, men and women and high-risk and low-risk drinkers, as was also reflected in the high correlations in rankings between subgroups. In particular, it was of interest to note how well the long-term harm ads performed with younger people, who might have been expected to self-exempt from these more distal harms. \n \n To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published study to identify and comparatively evaluate a large pool of alcohol harm reduction ads from many different countries using a standard criterion outcome measure with a large sample of drinkers. As ads were only rated by Australian drinkers, it could be assumed that ads produced in Australia would have been rated more highly than others. However, we found that the top-ranked 15% of ads was comprised of ads from Australia (six ads), the UK (four ads) and New Zealand (two ads), and we also found no significant differences in the distribution of ads across ranking categories by country of origin. By controlling for familiarity with the ads in our analyses, we further minimised the potential effect of country of production on responses to the ads. A study strength was that all ads were presented in a standard way, achieving consistent exposure. On the other hand, forced exposure may not reflect how viewers might respond in a natural media viewing situation where exposure occurs repeatedly over a longer duration. Another issue is that online non-probability panels do not provide a random population sample, and so we do not suggest our parameter estimates represent the national population statistically. However, online panels are typically used in the advertising industry to predict consumer responses to advertising, and the patterns of ad-elicited motivation observed in this large and varied sample are likely to reflect those in the population, particularly given the similarities between our sample's demographic and alcohol consumption characteristics with those of the benchmark national survey. \n \n Another limitation was that our outcome measure was felt motivation to reduce drinking rather than drinking behaviour change. In their description of the ‘Big Five Principles of Behaviour Change’, Hill and Dixon (2010) describe motivation as being a necessary condition for volitional behaviour, but they note that it is often insufficient on its own.55 Mass media campaigns (and other behaviour change programmes) can also address the other key principles of behaviour change, by modelling the desired behaviour (as demonstrated in the how-to-change behaviour ads in our sample), building capacity for change (by advocating for policy change), enabling people to remember the recommended behaviours (by ensuring sufficient campaign exposure and repetition at regular intervals) and providing reinforcement for the desired behaviour (by demonstrating the negative consequences of failing to reduce alcohol consumption).55 Further research could investigate the extent to which the effectiveness of alcohol harm reduction ads may be enhanced by addressing these other determinants of behaviour change. \n \n Collectively, this information may guide countries to develop campaign messages with the key features identified here, or to select any of the existing top-ranked ads with most potential to motivate change in adult drinking behaviour for broadcast in their own jurisdictions. Given the substantial upfront costs and resources involved in developing mass media campaigns, recycling existing campaign materials can help to ensure that scarce campaign resources can be directed towards achieving sufficient population exposure.56 ,57 It is notable that the two highest ranked ads in this study—Spread and What you can't see—predominantly consisted of animated imagery of the internal harms caused by alcohol (which are applicable to all people), rather than footage of models or settings that could be more culturally specific. These two ads are particularly suitable for low-cost adaptation for use in countries other than Australia given that the major adaptation required would be to revoice the ads and translate the final tagline. Recent tobacco control research has demonstrated the viability of adapting campaign messages shown to be effective in one setting for use in other jurisdictions.57 Studies comparing responses from smokers in 10 different countries found high levels of consistency in responses to different tobacco control ads across countries and demographic subgroups, particularly when these ads used graphic images to depict the physical effects of smoking in a direct and evocative manner.28 ,29 We therefore recommend that the current findings be used by jurisdictions to identify those ads that, following local pretesting and any necessary adaptations for language and taglines, may help to motivate reduced alcohol consumption within their own adult populations. \n \n In addition, our finding of consistent ad rankings across audience subgroups suggests that a ‘common denominator approach’ could have merit, thereby making scant resources go further.36 That is, by carefully selecting ads that appeared in the top-ranked category for all or most of the audience subgroups, countries could use a single campaign approach to motivate key demographic groups to reduce their drinking, while also resonating with the wider population to stimulate a broader cultural change process. However, we note that it is possible that the age groups compared in this study (18–29 year olds vs 30–64 year olds) were too broad to adequately capture variation in the range of responses to alcohol harm reduction ads across the age spectrum. Although all of our predicted mean scores on the motivation outcome were adjusted for age (including in the age-stratified models), future research may benefit from a more fine-grained segmentation when considering the effects of age in determining responses to alcohol harm reduction campaigns. \n \n The promising performance of ads that carried a guideline message suggests that more widespread and systematic promotion of drinking guidelines accompanied by good reasons to limit consumption could serve to provide a new anchoring point for decisions about consumption58 and shift public attitudes about alcohol.59 While there has been debate as to whether disseminating guidelines could confuse or backfire60 or even be relevant when many drinkers rely so much on their own sensed experience of how much they can drink,61 some suggest that there is a moral imperative to inform consumers62 and recent empirical observations provide reasons for optimism regarding their potential effectiveness.59 ,63 \n \n This study has identified specific campaign messages that offer the most potential to increase motivation to reduce alcohol consumption in the broader population, as well as in key demographic and high-risk drinker subgroups. This information makes an important contribution to the limited evidence base on the potential for mass media campaigns to reduce alcohol-related harm. Although we noted earlier that perceived effectiveness measures—of which the motivation outcome used here is one—predict behaviour change for tobacco control ads,41 ,42 further studies should examine the predictive validity of this and other perceived effectiveness outcomes for subsequent reduced drinking behaviour. Further research is also necessary to validate our assumption that the ads that performed most strongly among Australian drinkers would similarly impact drinkers in other jurisdictions. It would also be of interest to examine if certain long-term harms are more motivating than others, given six out of seven of the long-term harm ads in the top-ranked 15% of ads specifically mentioned cancer. Overall, our findings suggest there may be promise in resourcing alcohol harm reduction campaigns that educate audiences about why they may need to change their drinking by providing information about the long-term harms of risky alcohol use and communicating guidelines for low-risk drinking.""]",4,"– If you want to get people to stop boozing it up, don't show them images of glasses of healthy, sparkling water instead of beer—show them an ad that illustrates how too many cocktails can cause cancer to course through their bodies, the Guardian reports. That's the finding of a new study published in the BMJ Open journal that examined English-language alcohol ads to identify which ones proved best at inspiring drinkers to cut down. Researchers tapped a pool of 2,174 Australian adults ages 18 to 64 who drink alcohol at least one or two days a week. A total of 83 ads were shown, and the subjects were instructed to note after viewing each one how motivated they were to reduce their drinking on a scale from one to five, with ""one"" counting as an unmotivated ""Nah, I'm good,"" and ""five"" as ""Take the key to my liquor cabinet and bury it, please."" The most effective ad: ""Spread,"" a 30-second video created by the Western Australian government a few years ago that shows the cancerous mutations wrought after alcohol gets into one's bloodstream. The dud: that ad pushing water over beer. Cancer Council Victoria CEO Todd Harper tells the Guardian that ""Spread"" may have made an impact because folks simply don't know alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen, the most dangerous category. Even though Fergus Taylor, the director of Alcohol Beverages Australia, calls the ""Spread"" ad ""scaremongering,"" Harper notes ""every drink"" ups one's chance of getting cancer, including that of the mouth, liver, and bowel. What these findings should do is spur campaigns that maximize the public's awareness of alcohol so they can cut their cancer risk, Harper says, per Mumbrella. (A study says alcohol can be directly tied to seven cancers.)"

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.', ""“I need to know where I come from,” said Trinh Tran, 46, a real estate agent in Houston who has searched in vain for her G.I. father. “I always feel that without him, I don’t exist.” \n \n By some estimates, tens of thousands of American servicemen fathered children with Vietnamese women during that long war. Some of the children were a result of long-term relationships that would be unimaginable to the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where interaction with local people was minimal. Others were born of one-night stands. But few of the fathers ever met their offspring, and fewer still brought them home to America. \n \n After the war, those children — known as Amerasians — endured harsh discrimination and abject poverty in Vietnam, viewed as ugly reminders of an invading army. Shamed by reports of their horrible living conditions, Congress enacted legislation in 1987 giving Amerasians special immigration status. Since then, more than 21,000, accompanied by more than 55,000 relatives, have moved to the United States under the program, and several thousand more have come under other immigration policies. \n \n Many arrived expecting to be reunited with their American fathers. But the United States government did not help in that cause, and only a tiny fraction — perhaps fewer than 5 percent — ever found them. \n \n So many Amerasians continue to search, typically working with little more than badly translated names, half-forgotten memories and faded photographs. \n \n And some veterans are doing the same, driven by heartache, or guilt, to find sons and daughters. “It’s like the mother who gives up their kid for adoption,” said George Pettitt of Wales Center, N.Y. “You just never stop thinking about it.” \n \n Mr. Pettitt, 63, enlisted in the Army after dropping out of high school and was in Vietnam by age 19. During his year there, he developed a relationship with a Vietnamese woman who did laundry for soldiers. Soon she was pregnant. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “I was taking comfort in having a girlfriend like that,” he said. “I never meant for her to get pregnant.” \n \n He returned home to western New York, lost touch with the woman, got a job driving trucks and raised a family. But when he retired for health reasons in 2000, he found himself haunted by memories of the child he left behind — a boy, he believes. He paid a man to look in Vietnam, but the trail went cold. This year, a woman in Virginia called to say she thought her husband might be his son. But a DNA test was negative. \n \n “I was hoping this was it,” he said. “I just feel so guilty about all this.” \n \n Yet against the odds and despite the many years, children and fathers sometimes find each other. \n \n Cuong Luu was born in Vietnam, the child of an American soldier who met his mother when she cleaned his apartment. The soldier left Vietnam before Mr. Luu was born, and his mother lost contact with him. Soon after, she married an American who worked for the military. He moved the family to the Virgin Islands when Mr. Luu was a toddler. \n \n Mr. Luu inherited many of his father’s features, and in the black neighborhood of St. Thomas where he grew up, he was taunted for being white. His mother also shunned him, he said, perhaps ashamed of the hard memories he evoked. \n \n At the age of 9, he was in a home for delinquent boys. By 17, he was living on the street, selling marijuana and smoking crack. At 20, he was in prison for robbing a man at gunpoint. When he got out, his half sister took him to Baltimore, where he resumed selling drugs. \n \n Photo \n \n But then he had a daughter with a girlfriend, and something inside him changed. “I worried I would just go to jail and never see her,” he said of his daughter, Cara, who is 4. \n \n Long plagued by questions about his identity, he decided he needed to find his biological father to set his life straight. “I wanted to feel more whole,” said Mr. Luu, 41. “I just wanted to see him with my own two eyes.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The quest became an obsession. Mr. Luu spent every night on his computer, hunting unsuccessfully until he realized he had spelled the name wrong: it was Jack Magee, not McGee. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In November, Mr. Magee, a retired teacher from Southern California, visited Mr. Luu on his birthday. An awkward relationship, full of possibility but not untouched by resentment and wariness, was born. \n \n Mr. Magee now calls his son weekly, checking to make sure he is still working in his job cleaning hospital rooms in Baltimore. He also shipped a used Toyota Corolla from California to Mr. Luu, who had been commuting by bus. \n \n “I was stunned he was out there,” Mr. Magee, 75, said in an interview. \n \n Now that he has found his father, Mr. Luu said, he feels stronger. But the discovery, he has realized, has not solved his problems. What can a former felon do to make a better living? Go to college? Start a business? Drug dealing remains a powerful temptation. \n \n “I just wish I had met him before,” Mr. Luu said. “He could have taught me things.” \n \n Brian Hjort, a Danish man who has helped Mr. Luu and other Vietnamese track down their fathers, says Amerasians often have unrealistically high expectations for reunions with fathers, hoping they will heal deep emotional wounds. But the veterans they meet are often infirm or struggling economically. Sometimes the relationships are emotionally unfulfilling. \n \n “I try to tell them: I can’t guarantee love,” Mr. Hjort said. “I can only try to find your father.” \n \n Mr. Hjort, 42, is among a small coterie of self-trained experts who have helped Amerasians track down fathers, mostly pro bono. An industrial painter from Copenhagen, he first met Amerasians while traveling through Vietnam and the Philippines two decades ago and was struck by their desperate poverty. \n \n One asked him to find a friend’s father, and to his amazement he tracked the man down even though he had no knowledge of military records. News of Mr. Hjort’s success traveled rapidly through Amerasian circles, and he was soon besieged with pleas for help. Moved by the Amerasians’ suffering, he took on more cases, charging only the cost of his trips to Vietnam. He created a Web site, fatherfounded.org, that brought more requests than he could handle. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Working in his spare time, he has found scores of fathers, he estimates. Some had died, and many others hung up on him. A few have threatened to sue him. But perhaps two dozen have accepted their children. And in recent years, veterans, too, have begun asking for help. James Copeland was one. \n \n In 2011, Mr. Copeland, by then retired, began reading about Amerasians’ miserable lives in Vietnam. Appalled, he decided to search for his own child. \n \n He found Mr. Hjort and sent him money to visit Vietnam. Armed with a few names and a crude map, Mr. Hjort found the village where Mr. Copeland had been based and tracked down the brother of an Amerasian woman who was living in America and who Mr. Hjort believed was Mr. Copeland’s daughter. \n \n Mr. Hjort sent a photograph of the woman and her mother to Mr. Copeland, and his heart jumped: he instantly recognized the mother as his old girlfriend. His hands were shaking with excitement as he dialed the daughter’s number and asked: “Is this Tiffany Nguyen?” \n \n In the coming days, he visited her, her mother and her three brothers in Reading, Pa., where she runs a nail salon at the Walmart. Ms. Nguyen and her three children spent Thanksgiving 2011 with him in Mississippi. For a time, they talked nightly, and she told him about how her mother had protected her from abuse in Vietnam, about their struggles to adapt to the United States, about how she had studied older men at the Walmart, wondering if one of them was her father. \n \n “There were a lot of years to cover,” Mr. Copeland said. “I can sleep a lot better now.” \n \n But the reunion has also brought him unexpected heartache. His wife became furious when she discovered that he had a Vietnamese daughter, and she demanded that he not visit her. He refused: Ms. Nguyen is his only biological child. After 37 years of marriage, he and his wife are separated and considering divorce, he said. His wife did not respond to efforts to reach her for comment. \n \n Mr. Copeland now helps Mr. Hjort contact veterans they believe are fathers of Amerasians. In his patient drawl, Mr. Copeland calmly tells them his story and urges them to confront the possibility that they, like him, have Vietnamese children. \n \n But if they dodge his calls or hang up, he continues to leave messages — with children, with spouses, on answering machines. They need to know, he said. \n \n “Some people, they just want to move on and forget it,” he said. “I don’t see how they can do it. But there’s a lot of them that I’m sure that’s the case. They just want to forget.”"", '— The girls walk up and down the bar-lined street in Ho Chi Minh City, enticing male tourists to come in, come in, sit down, have a drink. \n \n Next door to the Caphe Da Lat 244 one recent night, a Vietnam veteran named Jim Reischl watches this scene unfold impassively, taking a drink out of a sweaty beer. Hard to believe it now, but more than four decades ago, a night just like this one changed his life. \n \n He was a 21-year-old Air Force sergeant from St. Joseph, Minn., a virgin who had been in Vietnam three months before his buddies at Tan Son Nhut Air Base finally persuaded him to head into town and have some fun. \n \n That night, he met a bar girl named Linh Hoa and bought her a cup of tea. She was a sex worker. She spoke little English. She had a cascade of long hair that fell all the way down her back. He was smitten. \n \n After nearly a lifetime had passed, he found himself back in Vietnam, the first of four trips he would take hoping to find her. All this time later, he’s never been able to forget something she said shortly before he was due to ship out on the Fourth of July, 1970. \n \n “She told me she was pregnant,” he recalls. “Was she telling me the truth? I don’t know. At that moment, she said she wanted to come back to America with me.” \n \n He didn’t believe her at the time. He thought maybe she was trying to trap him into taking her to the United States, something his military trainers had warned him about. But for nearly 45 years, two failed marriages and some Agent Orange-related health problems later, he can’t stop thinking about what she said. \n \n “I want her to tell me whether it’s true or not. Is there a child involved here? That’s what I want to find out,” he says. \n \n Reischl, 67, a retired cartographer, is not the only soldier who has turned up in Vietnam looking for his lost love in recent years, according to Brian Hjort, a Danish man who runs a volunteer Web site to help reunite solders with their Vietnamese girlfriends — and their children — called FatherFounded.org. Dozens have reached out to Hjort for help just in the past few years as their time has begun to wane. \n \n During the years American servicemen were posted to Vietnam before the fall of Saigon 40 years ago this month, their liaisons with local women produced an estimated 100,000 children. Many of those children were able to immigrate with their close family members after a special act of Congress passed in 1987, but hundreds remain in Vietnam. \n \n “We’re at an age now we want to find out answers,” said Dennis Hall, a Kirkland, Wash., veteran with a lost girlfriend and child who is helping Reischl. “It’s been in the dark for so many years. It would be nice to know before we pass away.” \n \n The group has connected Reischl with a Vietnamese translator and helped him place ads looking for Linh Hoa in local newspapers. He’s even undergone hypnosis to see whether he could remember the address she gave him on a scrap of paper that he threw away after she never answered his first letter. So far, nothing. \n \n The next day, Reischl makes a trip down to the neighborhood where he and Linh Hoa had a $5 a month apartment, on a street that was once called Nguyen Van Thoai but that has a different name now since the country unified and the government changed all the street names and numbers. \n \n By matching up the terra cotta tiles and distinctive grill work, he is able to narrow the search down to two adjoining buildings that were still there. The actual apartment where the two lovers shared whiskey sours and watched Armed Forces broadcasts on a small black-and-white television has been lost in time, just like the woman he knew there.

NCMEC recreated images of what Andrea Kuiper may have looked like and the images were distributed to the media.Investigators said the creation of the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System in 2010, and it\'s partnership with the FBI in March 2017 to check fingerprints, helped lead to Andrea Kuiper\'s identification.""Instead of looking at a 10-print system with all 10 fingers, there were looking at them individually, which is more like they would do at a crime scene,"" Keyes detailed.Investigators got a hit when her fingerprints matched the ones taken when she applied for a job at the Department of Agriculture just three years before her death.""It was one of those once in a career type moments to know that Andrea was Andrea,"" Keyes described.After Andrea Kuiper was identified on May 4, investigators worked to locate her parents to tell them about the discovery.""We are thankful to know what happened to our daughter after all these years,"" her father Richard Kuiper said in a written release. ""Andrea was loved and respected. She was beautiful. But she was manic depressive, and therefore we had been through quite an adventure.""', ""It was 10 p.m. on April Fools’ Day, 1990.

She had a strand of hair wrapped around her finger like a ring, and a lock of hair in her pocket. \n \n For 27 years, no one knew who she was, and her family was never told of her death. \n \n Now, thanks to a push to connect fingerprint databases among U.S. agencies, authorities have finally learned her identity: Andrea Kuiper, a 26-year-old Virginia native. \n \n A mystery, and no answer in sight \n \n There was too much trauma to Kuiper’s face to release a photo after her death, said Kelly Keyes, an Orange County supervising deputy coroner. Instead, authorities released a sketch and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children even created and circulated a computer-generated model of what she might look like. \n \n ( Orange County Sheriff's Department ) \n \n (Orange County Sheriff's Department) \n \n The sketches helped investigators in some ways, but they didn’t resolve the matter. The closest police got to learning her identity was a few people telling them that her name was Andrea. One person told investigators that they thought she may be from Newport News, Va. \n \n This was a case that should have been easier than many others to solve, Keyes said. Investigators had her DNA, dental records, fingerprints, even a first name. \n \n About seven years ago, they put all her information into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), a national searchable database established in 2010 to help solve cold cases such as this one. \n \n But the years went on, and Andrea’s identity remained a mystery. \n \n Decades later, looking for a match \n \n Keyes has been leading the effort to get answers on unidentified bodies for about a year and a half. There are more than 90 open cases. She has solved two. \n \n Last year, Keyes reviewed the file and reached out to Newport News police “to make sure they didn’t have any new missing person reports matching Andrea’s description,” Keyes said. They didn’t. \n \n Shown is a screenshot of Andrea Kuiper's case summary. (Orange County Sheriff's Department) \n \n The breakthrough came thanks to a partnership between the FBI and NamUs to solve more cases such as this one. Kuiper, it turns out, worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture , Keyes said. Her job application in 1987 included fingerprints, and someone in the federal government had finally put those fingerprints into a system that the FBI accessed and shared with NamUs, she said. \n \n Finally, last week, there was a match. \n \n “We were very excited,” Keyes said. “We’re here to serve the public and try to get a family answers and support the deceased. So to finally get Andrea a name was doing exactly what we hoped to do.” \n \n Who was Andrea Kuiper? \n \n One of two children, Kuiper loved ice skating and art as a girl — her parents still have some of her drawings, they said in a statement. Her family described her as “smart, clever, attractive and persuasive,” according to a news release from the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. \n \n The last her parents heard of her was from a friend a few months before the accident, who told them Kuiper was safe. They never filed a missing person’s report, Keyes said. \n \n “We are thankful to know what happened to our daughter after all these years,” Andrea’s father, Richard Kuiper, said in a statement. “Andrea was loved and respected. She was beautiful.

"['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n \n Kiruna Church (Swedish: Kiruna kyrka) is a church building in Kiruna, Sweden, and is one of Sweden\'s largest wooden buildings. The church exterior is built in a Gothic Revival style, while the altar is in Art Nouveau. \n \n In 2001, Kiruna Church was voted the most popular pre-1950 building in Sweden, in a country-wide poll conducted by the Swedish Travelling Exhibitions, a government agency connected to the Ministry of Culture.[1][2]It is considered to be ""the Shrine of the Nomadic people.""[3] \n \n History [ edit ] \n \n The church was built between 1909–1912, and consecrated by Bishop Olof Bergqvist on 8 December 1912.[4] Since 1913, the church is included in the Jukkasjärvi parish in the diocese of Luleå.[5] Gustaf Wickman was the church\'s architect and the famous altarpiece is a work of Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke.[6][5] \n \n Interior of the church. \n \n References [ edit ] \n \n Media related to Kiruna Church at Wikimedia Commons', 'The northernmost city in Sweden, Kiruna, was back in the news this week with reports that it would be moving — yes, moving — about two miles east. And, for once, an unusual story from the Arctic Circle had nothing to do with climate change. \n \n Why would a town need to move? \n \n Kiruna’s plan to move has been in the works for a few years now. The city, comfortably within the borders of the Arctic Circle and home to a little more than 18,000 people, is built on a hill above a vast iron ore mine. Founded in 1900 and midwifed by a state-owned mining company, Kiruna has been an industry town for over a century. \n \n Now that industry is simultaneously endangering the city and paying for its relocation. As the mine on Kiruna’s western border has expanded deeper into the ground, ore is being removed from beneath the city’s foundations — literally undermining the ground it sits on.', 'More than 120 miles north of the Arctic Circle lies the city of Kiruna, Sweden, a charming community of roughly 18,000 that provides 90% of all the iron sold in the European Union. \n \n The city is booming and beloved by its residents, but there\'s just one problem: Kiruna is sinking into the earth. \n \n The city\'s iron mines are located almost directly below its current center, and decades of heavy mining have loosened the city\'s foundations, deforming the ground in the area. If the city wants to keep extracting iron, it must go dangerously deep into the Earth, possibly risking total collapse of homes and buildings. \n \n Kiruna\'s solution: Pick up the entire city and relocate it, nearly two miles away from the mines. \n \n Relocating an entire city, of course, is highly complicated and difficult — not to mention costly. But LKAB, the state-owned company responsible for the mine, is footing the entire bill until the year 2033. In 2010, LKAB had already spent $2.4 billion on the move and announced plans to sink another $3.8 billion in the following years. \n \n The total cost of relocating the city is still anyone\'s guess, however, since the move will last the rest of the century. LKAB predicts its rich supply of iron ore will finance the project, keeping it afloat for decades to come. \n \n The architecture firm behind the move, White, plans to migrate the city center over the next five years, concluding sometime between 2019 and 2021. Relocating the entirety of Kiruna will take much longer. According to White\'s timeline, the town will slowly move eastward, neighborhood by neighborhood, relocating the majority of its buildings and population within 30 years. But the master plan, which includes turning Kiruna into a more sustainable, walkable city with a diversified economy, is expected to be compete sometime around 2100. \n \n In the short term, White has been tasked with moving many of Kiruna\'s most prized structures. Some, particularly the buildings that have been in the city for decades, will be plucked from their foundations and driven or airlifted to the new city center. \n \n One of those buildings is the town church, which opened in 1912 and was voted the most beautiful building in Sweden in 2001 by Swedish residents. Others include Kiruna\'s city hall and a local store, called Centrum, which has been family-run since 1933. \n \n ""They are going to move the city and we will follow along,"" Johanna Sevä, the store\'s co-owner, explains in a new short film about Kiruna. ""We are going to move with the store."" \n \n Not all buildings will be relocated, however. LKAB plans to pay residents of homes or apartments that aren\'t getting moved 25% more than market value to cover the cost of a new house. Residents can also opt to swap their old home for a new one, which is what Johanna Sevä did in 2013. The homes that are left behind will get demolished. \n \n Officials from LKAB first noticed the damage caused by mining in 2003 when miners sought to expand their digging to penetrate deeper iron stores. By the next year, the town had already decided to move. \n \n Mark Szulgit, one of the architects involved with the project, says that successfully moving the city\'s most iconic pieces of history will be the key to preserving Kiruna\'s identity. \n \n ""Our biggest challenge is not the design of a new city, which is sustainable and attractive and modern,"" Szulgit says in the film. ""The biggest challenge is to move the minds of the people, and to move the culture.""']",3,"– What do you do when a city is sinking? Why, you move it, of course. That's what the Swedish city of Kiruna has decided because iron mining below it has weakened the foundations of houses and buildings, Tech Insider reports. Now LKAB, the state-owned company behind the mining, is dedicating billions of dollars to moving Kiruna about 2 miles east. The ongoing 30-year plan includes relocating 21 particular buildings (like Kiruna's city hall and its attractive church) and paying residents to have their homes demolished and rebuilt at the new location, the Guardian reported last year. An Arctic city that's in darkness most of the year, Kiruna ""will be a bit like a walking millipede with a thousand feet, moving, crawling, slowly ... toward the east,"" says an architect in a promotional video for the plan. Critics say social networks will be shattered by the move and relocated residents will have higher rents, but on the bright side, the new city is supposed to be more walkable and economically diverse. Plus there's a lot at stake: Founded partly by LKAB in 1900, the city of 18,000 supplies the European Union with 90% of its iron. ""There might be some concerns, but the mine has to keep operating,"" a resident says. It's not a first, either: Cities have been relocated before for economic or safety reasons, and other towns are considering moves over climate change, the New York Times notes. Only possible problem for Kiruna? ""Iron is under the new town center, too,"" admits a city official. ""[But] it will be too expensive for LKAB to move the city again."" (In another mining story, Apple and Microsoft are said to use cobalt mined by kids.)"
"['A 40-year-old woman from Shawnee, Oklahoma, recently had to get major parts of both arms and both legs amputated due to a serious infection from an unnoticed tick bite after a vacation, according to her husband and hospital staff. \n \n The patient, Jo Rogers, is currently in the intensive care unit of Integris\' Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma City, where she is being treated for complications stemming from Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), her husband, Keith Rogers, told ABC News Friday. \n \n RMSF is a potentially fatal tick-borne disease caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n ""After things started going bad and she went into septic shock, the blood flow cut off to her limbs, and her hands and feet started going black,"" her husband said. ""So, two weeks ago, they had to cut off her right leg just above the knee, her left leg just below the knee and both her arms about mid-forearm."" \n \n Keith Rogers said that he visits his wife every day at the hospital as she battles other complications from RMSF, including blood clots in her lungs that necessitated a tracheotomy last Friday. \n \n ""Every day is a new challenge,"" he said. ""I go in there, sit and talk to her and show her pictures of how our two boys are doing. I show her videos of her two dogs back at home. I try to keep it normal, but it gets very hard because she\'ll want me not to leave, and it\'s so hard because I can\'t take her with me."" \n \n Though Jo Rogers currently can\'t speak or walk, her husband wants people to know she is a fun-loving woman who loved her dogs, hiking and nature. \n \n The couple went hiking at Natural Falls State Park, close to the Oklahoma-Arkansas border, this past Fourth of July, he said, explaining that there weren\'t many waterfalls in Oklahoma and she wanted to go see one. \n \n ""But when we came back, she started feeling sick, and she thought she might have the flu,"" Keith Rogers said, noting that headaches turned into fevers that then became aggravated with vomiting and dizziness. \n \n Though his wife initially resisted going to the hospital, she was so lethargic a week later that ""she wasn\'t making any sense,"" Keith Rogers said, so he took her to the emergency room. \n \n As her health deteriorated, doctors did rounds of tests on her, including tests for meningitis and West Nile Virus, but they only figured out she had complications from a tick-borne illness when she was already developing gangrene on her limbs, he said. \n \n ""We\'re not sure if she was bit by the tick when we were hiking at the falls or if it was at home,"" he said. ""I don\'t think it\'s really set in with my family yet, but for me, it\'s up and down every day."" \n \n Keith Rogers said he\'s not sure if his wife will be in the hospital for a few more months or a year, but once she\'s fully recovered, he said she\'ll likely transition to rehab and that the family would take it from there. \n \n A GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of Jo\'s medical care has been set up by her cousin, he added. \n \n ""RMSF is the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in Oklahoma,"" according to the state Health Department. ""In addition, Oklahoma has one of the highest rates of RMSF in the United States."" \n \n A spokesperson for Integris\' Baptist Medical Center told ABC News that Jo Rogers\' physician declined to be interviewed but confirmed she was currently at the hospital being treated for RMSF and that she has had amputations. \n \n Dr. Jennifer Ashton, a senior medical contributor for ABC News, said RMSF is s currently in peak tick season. \n \n ""It\'s been reported in urban areas and even found in people who have not been camping,"" she said. \n \n The symptoms -- fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and rash -- can mimic a lot of viruses, she said. \n \n ""If there is a suspicion that these symptoms could be related to a tick bite, the recommendation is to start doxycycline antibiotics immediately because time is of the essence,"" said Ashton.', ""This is my precious, beautiful cousin, Jo Rogers. She just turned 40 last march, has 2 young sons, ages 17 and 12 and today is her and her husband, Keith's 14th wedding anniversary, but she isn't able to celebrate it. She has been in the 3 different hospitals since July 9th, after a short vacation in NE Oklahoma. Shortly after being moved to an Oklahoma City hospital, she went into septic shock and was put on a ventilator into a medical coma. She was tested for West Nile Virus, meningitis and all other bacterial and viral infections. To protect her vital organs, her body deferred the infection to her limbs. Since then she has had surgeries to remove her right leg mid-thigh, her left leg below the knee and both of her arms mid-forearm. She will soon have more surgeries on her arms to prevent the infection from spreading more. Last Friday, it was found that she has a blood clot in her lung, more infection in her blood and they are fighting the possibility of pneumonia. They finally found that she has Rocky Mountain Spotted Tick Fever; the worst case seen. She is still on a ventilator and being kept sedated to help with pain. Although she will have insurance for a couple more months, her medical bills are mounting daily and will continue as she will be in the hospital for many more months with rehab, prosthetics and home and car renovation to accommodate her needs. While still working, her husband is at the hospital for most of his free time while still trying to take care of their sons.

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) is a disease caused by the bacteria Rickettsia rickettsii (R. rickettsii). In Oklahoma, the tick most closely associated with RMSF is the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). The other known tick vectors of R. rickettsii include the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus), and the cayenne tick (Amblyomma cajennense). Humans nearly always become infected with the bacteria following the bite of an infected tick. Tick bites due to the American dog tick are common in Oklahoma, but fortunately only 1–3% of the tick population is infected with R. rickettsii and capable of transmitting RMSF. \n \n At least 4–6 hours of tick attachment and feeding are usually required to pass on the infection to humans. The symptoms of RMSF usually begin 3–14 days following the infected tick bite. There is usually a sudden onset of fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle soreness. A fine, bumpy red rash often appears on the extremities about 3–5 days after the fever, which may quickly spread to the palms, soles and trunk. However, not all persons with RMSF develop a rash. Other common symptoms of RMSF include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and red eyes. \n \n Diagnosis is based upon clinical signs and symptoms, but laboratory testing can also be used to help diagnose RMSF. Blood samples taken in the early stage of illness (acute phase) and follow up samples taken 2–4 weeks later (convalescent phase) are used to confirm cases of RMSF through serologic testing. However laboratory testing can take days to weeks for results to become available, so treatment should never be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation. \n \n The first line treatment for all cases of RMSF is antibiotics (doxycyline). Treatment should be started immediately whenever RMSF is suspected because it can be a very serious disease; overall, 3–5% of all persons with RMSF die, but death is uncommon with prompt diagnosis and treatment. Factors associated with worse outcomes include delayed antibiotic therapy and age over 40 years. Although RMSF can be severe, preventive antibiotic therapy in non-ill persons following a tick bite is not recommended. \n \n The key to preventing RMSF is avoiding tick bites and using personal tick bite prevention strategies when in wooded or tick infected areas. \n \n Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Fact Sheets and Information: \n \n \n \n Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Fact Sheet (91k.pdf) \n \n Fiebre maculosa de las montañas rocosas Hoja Informativa (172k.pdf) \n \n Tickborne Disease Prevention \n \n Map of Five Year Average Incidence Rate by County, Year 2012-2016 (263k.pdf) \n \n External Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Resources: \n \n \n \n RMSF (CDC) \n \n Tickborne Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Data (1000kb.pdf)(CDC)']",3,"– A Fourth of July hike to see waterfalls near Grand Lake, Okla., took a bad turn once Jo Rogers and her husband, Keith, got home. Soon after their return, Keith tells ABC News, Jo didn't feel well and suspected the flu. But as Jo got sicker and so lethargic that Keith says ""she wasn't making any sense,"" he took her to the ER about a week after they came home—and things continued to worsen. ""She was shaking her hands because they hurt, her feet hurt,"" her cousin, Lisa Morgan, tells KOCO. Then her organs began shutting down, and ""by Saturday morning, her arms and feet were turning dark blue and black. It was crawling up her limbs,"" Morgan says. The diagnosis: a tick bite that infected Jo with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The course of treatment: to amputate all four of her already-gangrenous limbs to give her a chance at life. ""They had to cut off her right leg just above the knee, her left leg just below the knee and both her arms about mid-forearm,"" her husband tells ABC, noting Jo has also been contending with other complications from the disease, including blood clots in her lungs that called for a tracheotomy. Up to 5% people who contract RMSF end up dying, the state Department of Health notes, but death isn't common in patients who receive rapid diagnosis and treatment. Keith Rogers doesn't know how long his wife will be in the hospital receiving treatment and rehab, he tells ABC. ""Every day is a new challenge. I go in there, sit and talk to her and show her pictures of how our two boys [ages 12 and 17, per a GoFundMe page for the family] are doing,"" he tells ABC.

"['House Republicans unveiled a $1 trillion spending bill setting budgets for hundreds of government programs in a bid to force U.S. lawmakers to wrap up their work for the year. \n \n Republicans aim to put the more than 1,200-page spending measure to a vote tomorrow, a move designed to give them an advantage in a separate battle with Democrats over extending an expiring payroll tax cut. \n \n Passing the spending bill would let Republicans leave for their Christmas holiday, increasing pressure on the Democratic-controlled Senate to accept it as well as Republicans’ version of the payroll tax cut. Democrats have been holding up the legislation on concerns that approval would ensure the House recess, forcing them to accept both measures. \n \n A short-term bill funding federal agencies expires tomorrow and without action by Congress, the government will partially shut down. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said his colleagues want to break the payroll-tax stalemate. \n \n “Hopefully, the Senate will act,” he told reporters yesterday. “But you know how they are. We’re not going to sit around here and wait two weeks, twiddling our thumbs, waiting for the Senate.” \n \n Short-Term Measure \n \n President Barack Obama’s spokesman Dan Pfeiffer said last night in a statement that lawmakers instead ought to pass a short-term budget measure to allow more time for negotiations on the budget bill and the payroll-tax plan. \n \n “Given the magnitude of the legislation -- providing over $1 trillion dollars in funding -- coupled with the unresolved payroll-tax cut and unemployment insurance extension, Congress should pass a short-term continuing resolution,” Pfeiffer said. \n \n Some Republicans expressed qualms about their party’s strategy. Representative Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, said lawmakers will be asked to vote on legislation they won’t have enough time to read. “It goes against a lot of what we’ve said we were going to do,” he said. \n \n The party’s campaign “Pledge to America” last year said “we will end the practice of packaging unpopular bills with ‘must-pass’ legislation” and “instead, we will advance major legislation one issue at a time.” \n \n Oil Pipeline \n \n Democrats are balking at some provisions in the House- passed payroll-tax plan, including plans to expedite construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to Texas, raising Medicare premiums for wealthier retirees and paring unemployment benefits. \n \n The spending measure wraps together nine overdue appropriations bills funding almost 40 percent of the government, including the Departments of Defense, Labor, Education, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and others. \n \n Some House Republicans said yesterday they are unsure how many of their colleagues will support the budget plan, which has been criticized for spending too much. More than 100 Republicans, 40 percent of the chamber’s caucus, opposed a spending bill last month, forcing party leaders to rely on Democratic votes for passage. \n \n Representative Tim Huelskamp, a Kansas Republican, said yesterday he was withholding judgment because he wasn’t sure what would be in the legislation, which was released early today. \n \n ‘See What’s In It’ \n \n “I’m not going to vote for something unless I have a pretty good idea of what’s in it and right now, we don’t,” Huelskamp said. “I’ve got to see what’s in it.” \n \n The budget bill, combined with a related bill passed last month, would cap non-emergency discretionary spending at $1.043 trillion, according to the Republicans’ summary. That would be $7 billion less than last year and the second consecutive year appropriations have declined. \n \n The cuts are larger when compared with inflation, currently 3.5 percent, and the increased demand for government services that comes with population growth. \n \n More than half of the bill is comprised of the Defense Department’s budget, which would increase by $5 billion or about 1 percent to $518 billion. That doesn’t include an additional $115 billion in emergency war funding. \n \n Foreign Aid \n \n Some of the biggest cuts would come in foreign aid and international programs, one of the politically easiest areas to cut. Funding for the State Department, global health programs, economic assistance and other initiatives would fall by 13 percent, according to Republicans. \n \n Pell grants, which help low-income families send children to college, would be cut by $11 billion over the next decade in part by tightening eligibility criteria. \n \n The Environmental Protection Agency would see a 3 percent cut, which, when combined with reductions approved earlier this year, would mean an 18 percent cut from 2010, according to Republicans. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, would receive a 6 percent cut. \n \n The bill also includes a number of policy “riders” including ones targeting the administration’s policies on travel and sending money to Cuba, energy-efficient light bulbs and public funding of abortions in Washington, D.C. \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Brian Faler in Washington at bfaler@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Silva at msilva34@bloomberg.net', 'Mitch McConnell says Harry Reid should talk to John Boehner. Reid says he wants to talk to Boehner to hash out a compromise on extending the payroll tax holiday and jobless benefits. But Boehner first wants Reid to show his hand by actually passing something. \n \n The three top leaders in Congress met privately Wednesday evening, but they came away no closer to a deal. At the meeting, Boehner said he wouldn’t negotiate with Reid and that the Senate majority leader would have to work out a payroll tax plan with McConnell, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n Boehner’s position is “he can’t cut a deal with Reid. If he did, our guys would go nuts,” according to a Republican source. The source added that without a Senate product, House Republicans are negotiating among themselves, and rank-and-file Republican lawmakers are “keenly focused” on making sure that doesn’t happen. \n \n Whether Reid and McConnell can cut a bipartisan deal — that can also pass the Republican-led House within days — will be the key question facing the leaders Thursday as they struggle to pass a payroll tax holiday, extend jobless benefits and approve more than $1 trillion in federal spending before adjourning for the holidays. Rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties are getting agitated over the inability of Congress to complete its most basic tasks without lurching into another crisis. \n \n The latest effort to find a breakthrough came as Democrats were considering scrapping their millionaires’ surtax. But it was far from clear what else they’d give up and whether Republicans would return any concessions. \n \n For every step toward a possible deal, there seemed to be a step backward: The White House put out a strongly worded statement Wednesday night calling on Congress to put off a mammoth $1 trillion government funding bill that Republicans had demanded as a condition for passing the payroll tax cut. \n \n Instead, the White House wants a short-term spending bill, an idea many Republicans have scoffed at. \n \n With a Friday deadline rapidly approaching, the developments created yet another picture of a dysfunctional Washington and a Congress with rock-bottom approval ratings that’s been defined by 11th-hour brinkmanship. Congress has until Jan. 1 to extend the payroll tax holiday before taxes go up for millions of workers, but lawmakers are trying to finish the year’s work by Friday’s scheduled adjournment. \n \n There are still a host of contentious battles ahead that will need to be ironed out between the White House and congressional leaders — and blessed by the rank-and-file. At the forefront in the payroll tax fight are several controversial matters, including the construction of a new oil pipeline, cuts to health care programs, the scrapping of an environmental rule and shortening the duration of jobless benefits. \n \n “The two biggest things are frustration with Washington’s gridlock and grave anxiety about some of the really bad ideas that are being foisted in Washington right now,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “Those things really unnerve people at home.” \n \n By Wednesday afternoon, each side had retreated to its respective corner: Reid and Senate Democratic leaders were meeting at the White House with President Barack Obama and weighing what concessions to make, including ditching the millionaires’ surtax that Republicans strongly oppose.']",2,"– In an effort to reach a compromise in one of the two year-end battles facing Congress, Democrats have decided to drop their demand for a surtax on millionaires to finance payroll tax cuts. Without a deal, 160 million workers will face an automatic Social Security tax increase on Jan. 1, but a quick bipartisan agreement on the legislation may be out of reach despite the Democratic retreat, AP notes. ""I don't think it's much of a concession,"" a spokesman for John Boehner says. ""It never had any chance of passing the Senate, let alone the House."" Lawmakers are also battling over a separate spending bill, and the squabble threatens to force a federal government shutdown by this weekend. House Republicans have unveiled a $1 trillion spending bill providing budgets for hundreds of government programs. They aim to pass the bill tomorrow, allowing them to depart for their Christmas holidays, Bloomberg reports. Some Republican lawmakers, however, are wary of passing legislation that they haven't had time to read, and as leaders squabble, rank-and file lawmakers from both parties are complaining about Congress' inability to perform its most basic tasks, Politico notes."

"['Copyright Marvel Comics \n \n Thor, the Norse god of thunder and Marvel comics superhero, is now a woman. News of the celestial upheaval came Tuesday morning via the ladies of The View, and Marvel now confirms that a woman will wield the hammer Mjölnir in a brand-new series starting in October. “This is not She-Thor,” says writer Jason Aaron in Marvel’s press release, published by the Mary Sue. “This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it’s unlike any Thor we’ve ever seen before.” \n \n I’m not sure there is much thmor to be said here in the way of gender analysis, although perhaps the character’s makeover has something to do with sublimated love for superhero Ruth Bader Ginsburg? (Hammer equals gavel.) But it is fun to chant that evocatively solid syllable in the new Avenger’s honor. While a lot of superheroines—including Marvel’s own Storm, Black Widow, and Captain Marvel—rely on lithe acrobatics to fight evil, Thor favors the brute smashing of things. Thor is mighty and unsubtle and loud. She doesn’t shoot dinky little arrows, like Hawkeye, or bat-shaped boomerangs. As Walter White might say, she is the one who knocks. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Plus, we have delicious logistical questions to consider, now that Asgard has decided to lean in. For instance, Marvel Studios has committed to at least two more Avengers movies, one in 2018 and one (we think) in 2021. Will the comic book Thor diverge from the film Thor until the mainstream catches up with Aaron and his team? Or will Chris Hemsworth hand off the flowing blond locks to a female actor? (If so, we’ll miss your arms, Chris!) \n \n Either way, as Whoopi Goldberg said this morning, “It’s a huge day in the Marvel universe.” And on Twitter, Marvel executive editor had a thunderous response to skeptical fans:', ""Marvel is excited to announce an all-new era for the God of Thunder in brand new series, THOR, written by Jason Aaron complimented with art from Russell Dauterman. \n \n This October, Marvel Comics evolves once again in one of the most shocking and exciting changes ever to shake one of the “big three” of Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. No longer is the classic Thunder God able to hold the mighty hammer, Mjölnir, and a brand new female hero will emerge worthy of the name THOR. \n \n Who is she? Where did she come from and what is her connection to Asgard and the Marvel Universe? \n \n “The inscription on Thor's hammer reads ‘Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.’ Well it's time to update that inscription,” says Marvel editor Wil Moss. “The new Thor continues Marvel's proud tradition of strong female characters like Captain Marvel, Storm, Black Widow and more. And this new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!” \n \n Series writer Jason Aaron emphasizes, “This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it’s unlike any Thor we’ve ever seen before.” \n \n THOR is the latest in the ever-growing and long list of female-centric titles that continues to invite new readers into the Marvel Universe. THOR will be the 8th title to feature a lead female protagonist and aims to speak directly to an audience that long was not the target for super hero comic books in America: women and girls. \n \n Join the conversation on Twitter and don’t forget to follow us at @Marvel.""]",2,"– We have seen the future Thor, and she is female: In a rather startling change, Marvel revealed today (to The View, naturally?) what it calls ""one of the most shocking and exciting changes"" to rattle the ranks of its biggest heroes—it seems our ""classic Thunder God"" is no longer worthy of the mighty hammer, Mjölnir, and so Marvel is rolling out a new female character to take it up. But careful: ""This is not She-Thor,"" says writer Jason Aaron. ""This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR."" It's an interesting change, notes Katy Waldman at Slate, because ""while a lot of superheroines—including Marvel’s own Storm, Black Widow, and Captain Marvel—rely on lithe acrobatics to fight evil, Thor favors the brute smashing of things. Thor is mighty and unsubtle and loud."" But while Marvel editor Wil Moss notes the inscription on Thor's hammer reads, ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor,"" he says that nevertheless, ""it's time to update that inscription."" The new hero debuts in October. (In other comics news, this is how Archie dies.)"
"['Microsoft co-founder says his exploration vessel M/Y Octopus found the battleship off the coast of the Philippines \n \n Sunk without trace in what some historians consider the greatest naval battle ever fought, the mightiest battleship ever built has been found off the Philippines by one of the world’s wealthiest men. \n \n Paul Allen, the multibillionaire Microsoft co-founder, on Tuesday posted photographs of the wreck of the Musashi, a second world war Japanese battleship that, with its sister-ship the Yamato, was the largest and most heavily-armed warship ever launched. \n \n “WW2 Battleship Musashi sank 1944 is FOUND,” Allen announced on Twitter, beneath a ghostly underwater photograph of the mammoth vessel’s rusting, coral-encrusted bow clearly bearing the chrysanthemum crest of the Japanese imperial family. \n \n Other pictures taken on the floor of the Sibuyan Sea by a team from the Octopus, Allen’s luxury yacht and undersea exploration vessel, showed one of the warship’s enormous anchors and a heavily encrusted valve captioned: “RIP crew of Musashi, approximately 1,023 lost.” \n \n Image taken by Paul Allen showing what Allen’s team believes is a valve wheel on the ship. Photograph: AP \n \n Allen, who has devoted a small part of his estimated $17.5bn fortune to deep-sea and space exploration, said on his website that the discovery of the wreck, at a depth of more than half a mile, marked “an important milestone in the annals of World War II naval history”. \n \n Designed to take on multiple enemy ships simultaneously, the Musashi was the second of the imperial Japanese navy’s colossal Yamato-class heavy battleships. Launched in November 1940, it measured 263m (863 feet) overall, weighed 73,000 tonnes fully laden, carried a crew of 2,500, and could travel at speeds of up to 27 knots (50 kph). \n \n But what most alarmed the Allies was the warship’s terrifying armament, which included the largest-calibre guns ever fitted to a warship: nine 46cm (18.1in) cannon mounted in three triple turrets, each capable of firing up to two 1,460kg (3,220lb) armour-piercing shells a minute over a maximum range of 26 miles. \n \n She was an awe-inpiring sight. “I had never,” the World War II Database records gunner Russ Dustan of the American aircraft carrier USS Franklin as saying, “seen anything as big in my entire life … It was huge.” \n \n But mighty as she was, the Musashi was not invulnerable – especially to aerial attack. On October 18 1944, Japanese vice admiral Takeo Kurita sailed with a 67-strong fleet, including both the Musashi and Yamato, into the Sibuyan Sea, west of the Philippine island of Leyte, aiming to throw back an American landing and attack vulnerable US transport ships on the other side of the island. \n \n At 8.10am on October 24 a spotter aircraft from the US carrier Intrepid spied the Japanese fleet, and by 10.27am, according to Japanese naval records, battle was formally engaged, with the Musashi’s massive guns in action for the first time. \n \n But with few Japanese aircraft to fend off the airborne attacks, the enormous vessel eventually became a sitting duck, reduced to firing its mammoth guns into the water to send up huge spouts of water aimed at knocking the attacking aircraft out of the air. \n \n “Running into one of these geysers was like running into a mountain,” one US pilot, Jack Lawton, was recorded as saying after the battle. “I felt the muzzle blast each time they fired. I could swear the wings were ready to fold every time these huge shockwaves hit us.” \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Japanese battleship Musashi in October 1944. Photograph: Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images \n \n The last American attack was over by 3.30pm, according to the US Naval Historical Centre, leaving the Musashi listing heavily from some 37 direct torpedo and bomb hits (the figure is disputed). At 7.15pm, Captain Toshihira Inoguchi retired to his cabin, intending to go down with his ship. The order to abandon ship came 15 minutes later and at 7.36pm the Musashi capsized and sank. Of the crew of 2,399, only 1,376 survived. \n \n Pitting combined American and Australian forces against the Japanese navy, the Battle of Leyte Gulf is widely considered to be the largest naval battle of World War II and is thought by some naval historians to be the largest in history. \n \n Despite numerous witness accounts of the sinking, the exact location of the Musashi’s wreck was never clearly established. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975 and is ranked by Forbes magazine as the 51st richest person in the world, said he began searching for the battleship more than eight years ago. \n \n In a statement, the billionaire said his team conducted a bathymetric survey of the ocean floor to eliminate large areas from the search, then conducted the final phase of the search using a autonomous underwater robot, or AUV, to detect the wreckage on Monday. An ROV, or remote operated vehicle, fitted with a high-definition camera and operated from the Octopus, later successfully filmed the battleship. \n \n Allen said he had long been fascinated by second world war history and was “honoured to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honouring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her”. \n \n The entrepreneur is also working on a project to put “cost-effective” cargo and manned missions into space, and launched SpaceShipOne, the first privately built craft to enter suborbital space, in 2004.', '(CNN) Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen says he has found the wreck of a long-lost World War II Japanese battleship near the Philippines. \n \n The philanthropist posted images on Twitter that appeared to show the Musashi, once one of the two largest warships in the world. The discovery was made aboard his superyacht, the MY Octopus, as part of an expedition that Allen launched. \n \n The search has taken Allen and his team of researchers more than eight years. \n \n The images and video were taken by an unmanned submersible deployed from the vessel. \n \n ""Since my youth, I have been fascinated with World War II history, inspired by my father\'s service in the U.S. Army,"" Allen said in a statement. \n \n ""The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel and, as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction. I am honored to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honoring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her."" \n \n He used his Twitter account to publicize the find. In one tweet, he said one image showed the bow of the ship, which features a distinctive chrysanthemum -- the flower is the emblem of Japan\'s royal family -- and a huge anchor. \n \n WW2 Battleship Musashi sank 1944 is FOUND > 1K M deep by MY Octopus Sibuyan sea, bow Chrysanthemum, huge anchor. pic.twitter.com/b9ZMA0icI8 — Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen) March 2, 2015 \n \n The other underwater photograph shows one of the Musashi\'s valves on which the Japanese characters for ""main valve handle"" and ""open"" are legible. \n \n He said the writing on the valve was proof that the ship was of Japanese origin. \n \n RIP crew of Musashi, appx 1023 lost.

According to U.S. Navy documents, torpedo planes from U.S. aircraft carriers scored at least 10 hits on the battleship over the course of four hours. Navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times, but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the Musashi. \n \n ""She went down by the bow, capsizing when the forward flying (U.S. forecastle) deck was submerged,"" said the Navy report, based on survivor accounts. \n \n Two of those survivors, the executive officer and the chief engineer, told how they escaped the sinking. \n \n ""The executive officer swam off from one of the upper levels in the tower. He saw the propellers as Musashi disappeared,"" the Navy report said. ""The chief engineer climbed over the side amidships as Musashi lurched to port. He walked and scrambled around the girth against the roll, climbing over the bilge keel. Finally, he was thrown off into the water and swam away to port. There were no explosions."" \n \n More than 1,000 of the Musashi\'s crew were killed during the battle and sinking. The 1,300-plus survivors were taken aboard by other Japanese warships, according to the U.S. Navy report. \n \n 1 kilometer deep \n \n This image, released by Paul Allen\'s company, Vulcan, appears to show the massive ship\'s starboard anchor. \n \n Allen said that his superyacht, the MY Octopus, had found the wreck at a depth of around 1 kilometer (3,281 feet). \n \n A statement released by Vulcan, Allen\'s company, said that the team combined historical data with advanced technology to narrow the search area, and that Allen had ""commissioned a hypsometric bathymetric survey of the ocean floor to determine the terrain"" before searching the area with a Bluefin autonomous underwater vehicle. \n \n Kazushige Todaka, the maritime museum director, said that, given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found, he was ""90% sure"" that the ship was the Musashi. \n \n ""I was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down. I have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered, but they all turned out not to be true."" \n \n Todaka said Allen\'s team had been in contact with the museum about the ship\'s potential location and its expedition. \n \n \'Wonderful discovery\' \n \n This shot, released by Allen\'s company, Vulcan, shows the Japanese royal family\'s chrysanthemum emblem on the bow. \n \n ""It\'s a wonderful discovery, if it\'s true, as we have long been looking for the battleship,"" he said. \n \n ""It\'s fateful that the discovery was made on the 70th anniversary of (the end of) World War II. The memory of the war has been fading away after 70 years, and the survivors of the war are disappearing. It is very meaningful discovery and a good chance for us to remind ourselves about the war and its tragedy."" \n \n He added that images of the entire body of the ship will be needed to be 100% sure that the discovery is indeed the Musashi. \n \n The Vulcan statement added that the team is ""mindful of the responsibility related to the wreckage of the Musashi as a war grave and intend to work with the Japanese government to ensure the site is treated respectfully and in accordance with Japanese traditions."" \n \n Diverse interests \n \n Since leaving Microsoft, the company he co-founded in 1975, billionaire Allen has immersed himself in a variety of commercial and charitable pursuits. \n \n He is the owner of several U.S. sports teams -- including the Seattle Seahawks -- and backed SpaceShipOne, the prototype commercial spaceplane that won the 2004 Ansari X Prize.']",2,"– The wreckage of Japan's biggest World War II warship has been discovered more than a half-mile underwater in the Sibuyan Sea, and credit for the find goes to a Microsoft co-founder, AFP reports. Paul Allen tweeted photos on Monday of the Musashi, sunk by US warplanes in 1944. Allen says he found the remains in the Philippines while exploring on his yacht, the M/Y Octopus, and describes it as the culmination of an eight-year search that relied on historical documents from four countries, a ""hypsometric bathymetric survey"" of the ocean floor, and his yacht's robust technology. After surveying the area, Allen and his team of researchers deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle to pinpoint the ship's location, according to a press release via CNBC that calls the Musashi ""one of the two largest and most technologically advanced battleships in naval history."" ""The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel, and as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction,"" Allen says. Underwater photos show a giant chrysanthemum on the ship's bow, symbolizing Japan's royal family; an image of one of the ship's valves reveals it bears Japanese writing.

"['Update:Judge calls emergency meeting over redaction errors. \n \n Former governor Rod Blagojevich\'s defense team asked Thursday to issue a trial subpoena to the President of the United States of America. \n \n The motion, intended to be heavily redacted, was improperly edited -- the full document was easily viewable if the text is copied and pasted to another document (an error first revealed on Capitol Fax). \n \n Below, the six revelations the redacted portions were meant to conceal. \n \n Line Up: Chicago Mayoral Hopefuls \n \n 1. Obama may have lied about conversations with convicted fraudster Tony Rezko \n \n Blagojevich\'s lawyers allege that Rezko admitted breaking the law by contributing ""a large sum of cash"" to a public official. Blagojevich\'s attorneys say that public official is Obama. Obama said that Rezko never relayed a request from a lobbyist to hold a fundraiser in favor of favorable legislative action. But the point may be moot: regardless of Obama talking/not talking to Rezko, Blagojevich\'s attorneys say that Obama refused the request regardless. \n \n Redacted portion : However, the defense has a good faith belief that Mr. Rezko, President Obama’s former friend, fund-raiser, and neighbor told the FBI and the United States Attorneys a different story about President Obama. In a recent in camera proceeding, the \n \n government tendered a three paragraph letter indicating that Rezko “has stated in interviews with the government that he engaged in election law violations by personally contributing a large sum of cash to the campaign of a public official who is not Rod Blagojevich. … Further, the public official denies being aware of cash contributions to his campaign by Rezko or others and denies having \n \n conversations with Rezko related to cash contributions. … Rezko has also stated in interviews with the government that he believed he transmitted a quid pro quo offer from a lobbyist to the public official, whereby the lobbyist would hold a fundraiser for the official in exchange for favorable official action, but that the public official rejected the offer. The public official denies any such conversation. In addition, Rezko has stated to the government that he and the public official had certain conversations about gaming legislation and administration, which the public official denies having had. \n \n PHOTOS: Blagojevich Cronies \n \n Redacted footnote : The defense has a good faith belief that this public official is Barack Obama. \n \n 2. Obama may have overtly recommended Valerie Jarret for his Senate seat \n \n Blagojevich\'s defense team basically alleges that Obama told a certain labor union official that he (Obama) would support Valerie Jarrett\'s candidacy for the Senate seat. Jarrett, referred to as ""Senate Candidate B"", is now a senior advisor to the president. \n \n Redacted portion : Yet, despite President Obama stating that no representatives of his had any part of any deals, labor union president told the FBI and the United States Attorneys that he spoke to labor union official on November 3, 2008 who received a phone message from Obama that evening. After labor union official listened to the message labor union official told labor union president “I’m the one”. Labor union president took that to mean that labor union official was to be the one to deliver the message on behalf of Obama that Senate Candidate B was his pick. (Labor union president 302, February 2, 2009, p. 7). \n \n 2010 Illinois Election Guide \n \n Labor union official told the FBI and the United States Attorneys “Obama expressed his belief that [Senate Candidate B] would be a good Senator for the people of Illinois and would be a candidate who could win re-election. [Labor union official] advised Obama that [labor union official] would reach out to Governor Blagojevich and advocate for [Senate Candidate B] ...

Obama maintained a list of good Senate candidates \n \n Redacted portion : President-elect Obama also suggested Senate Candidate A to Governor Blagojevich. John Harris told the FBI and the United States Attorneys that he spoke to President’s Chief of Staff on November 12, 2008. Harris took notes of the conversation and wrote that President’s Chief had previously worked as Blagojevich\'s press secretary. Obama agreed of Staff told Harris that Senate Candidate A was acceptable to Obama as a senate pick. (Harris handwritten notes, OOG1004463) President’s Chief of Staff told the FBI that “he could not say where but somewhere it was communicated to him that” Senate Candidate A was a suggested candidate viewed as one of the four “right” candidates “by the Obama transition team.” \n \n \n \n 5.

In addition, President Obama’s public statements contradict other witness statements, specifically those made by labor union official and Senate Candidate B,” the motion said. The motion is here. Several parts are redacted, but you can easily copy and paste the entire motion into a text file and view all the redacted material. Oops on somebody’s part. * All of the most explosive allegations in the motion were redacted. Blagojevich’s lawyers allege that Tony Rezko admitted to violating the law by personally contributing “a large sum of cash” to a public official’s campaign, which the Blagojevich people say is Obama. The lawyers claim that Obama may not have been telling the truth when he said Rezko never relayed a request from a lobbyist to hold a fundraiser for Obama in exchange for favorable legislative action (Obama, however, refused to agree to the offer, Rezko allegedly says). They also claim that Obama allegedly lied when he said he didn’t have any conversations with Rezko about a casino license… In a recent in camera proceeding, the government tendered a three paragraph letter indicating that Rezko “has stated in interviews with the government that he engaged in election law violations by personally contributing a large sum of cash to the campaign of a public official who is not Rod Blagojevich. … Further, the public official denies being aware of cash contributions to his campaign by Rezko or others and denies having conversations with Rezko related to cash contributions. Rezko has also stated in interviews with the government that he believed he transmitted a quid pro quo offer from a lobbyist to the public official, whereby the lobbyist would hold a fundraiser for the official in exchange for favorable official action, but that the public official rejected the offer. The public official denies any such conversation. In addition, Rezko has stated to the government that he and the public official had certain conversations about gaming legislation and administration, which the public official denies having had. President Obama is the only one who can testify as to the veracity of Mr. Rezko’s allegations above. A redacted footnote offers further explanation… The defense has a good faith belief that this public official is Barack Obama. As its proof, the Blagojevich people reference a 2006 Sun-Times story… Senator Barack Obama was asked: “Did Rezko or his companies ever solicit your support on any matter involving state or federal government? Did Al Johnson, who was trying to get a casino license along with Tony Rezko, or Rezko himself ever discuss casino matters with you?” Senator Obama answered: “No, I have never been asked to do anything to advance his business interest. In 1999, when I was a State Senator, I opposed legislation to bring a casino to Rosemont and allow casino gambling at docked riverboats which news reports said Al Johnson and Tony Rezko were interested in being part of. I never discussed a casino license with either of them. I was a vocal opponent of the legislation.” * The rest of the redacted stuff mostly involves claims by the Blagojevich team that Barack Obama was not totally truthful during FBI questioning. “Senate Candidate B” is Valerie Jarrett, who is now one of three senior advisers to the president… 9. Yet, despite President Obama stating that no representatives of his had any part of any deals, labor union president told the FBI and the United States Attorneys that he \n \n spoke to labor union official on November 3, 2008 who received a phone message from Obama that evening. After labor union official listened to the message labor union official told labor union president “I’m the one”. Labor union president took that to mean that labor union official was to be the one to deliver the message on behalf of Obama that Senate Candidate B was his pick. 10. Labor union official told the FBI and the United States Attorneys “Obama expressed his belief that [Senate Candidate B] would be a good Senator for the people of Illinois and would be a candidate who could win re-election. [Labor union official] advised Obama that [labor union official] would reach out to Governor Blagojevich and advocate for [Senate Candidate B].. . . [Labor union official] called [labor union president] and told [labor union president] that Obama was aware that [labor union official] would be reaching out to Blagojevich.” (Labor union official 302, February 3, 2009 p. 3). 11. According to Senate Candidate B, on November, 4 2008, Senate Candidate B spoke with labor union official about the Senate seat. Labor union official said he spoke to Obama. Labor union official said he was going to meet with Blagojevich and said “he was going to push Blagojevich hard on this. * There is also an allegation of an attempted quid pro quo on the Jarrett Senate appointment… Supporter of Presidential Candidate Obama is mentioned in a phone call on November 3, 2008, having offered “fundraising” in exchange for Senate Candidate B for senator (Blagojevich Home Phone Call # 149). …Adding… Obama allegedly shot down former Senate President Emil Jones’ name when it was floated by the Blagojevich team as a possible Senate appointment. And Rahm Emanuel floated Cheryle Jackson’s name… President’s Chief of Staff told the FBI that he had a conversation discussing the Senate seat with Obama on December 7, 2008 in Obama’s car. President’s Chief of Staff told the FBI “Obama expressed concern about Senate Candidate D being appointed as Senator. “[President’s Chief of Staff] suggested they might need an expanded list to possibly include names of African Americans that came out of the business world. [President’s Chief of Staff] thought he suggested Senate Candidate E who was the head of the Urban League and with President’s Chief of Staff’s suggestion.” *** UPDATE *** The New York Times hasn’t figured out that the redactions can be seen… Judging from what can be seen of the motion, which is full of blacked-out sentences and words (to comply with rules about sealed information), Mr. Blagojevich’s lawyers are hoping the president himself will point up contradictions in the prosecution case and testify about whether he had sent “emissaries” to Mr. Blagojevich with regard to who the White House would prefer fill the Senate seat. - posted by Rich Miller \n \n 89 Comments Sorry, comments for this post are now closed.']",2,"– Rod Blagojevich's defense team asked the judge to subpoena Barack Obama yesterday with a motion that was supposed to be heavily redacted. But whoever redacted it did a lousy job; the blacked out text could be easily read just by copying and pasting it, as Capital Fax revealed. Here's what Blago's lawyers allege in the redacted portions: Obama lied about his conversations with Tony Rezko. The lawyers say Obama turned down a fundraiser Rezko offered him in exchange for favorable legislative action. Obama has denied even having such a conversation. Obama directly recommended Valerie Jarrett for his old Senate seat, and gave Blagojevich a list of four candidates he considered acceptable. One of Obama's supporters offered to raise money for Blagojevich if he picked Jarrett. Obama had a secret phone call with Blagojevich in December—though the document doesn't say what was discussed.

"['In this June 21, 2018, photo, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., arrives for a news conference at the Capitol in Washington. House Republicans say they will make another run at immigration legislation... (Associated Press) \n \n In this June 21, 2018, photo, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., arrives for a news conference at the Capitol in Washington. House Republicans say they will make another run at immigration legislation... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican apprehension over President Donald Trump\'s next tweet and fear of riling conservative voters are undermining GOP leaders\' election-year struggle to shove an immigration bill through the House this week, leaving their prospects dubious. \n \n Party leaders are trying to finally secure the votes they need for their wide-ranging bill with tweaks they hope will goose support from the GOP\'s dueling conservative and moderate wings. But more importantly, wavering Republicans want Trump to provide political cover for immigration legislation that\'s despised by hard-right voters. His recent statements on their bill and history of abruptly flip-flopping on past health care and spending measures have not been reassuring. \n \n Last Tuesday, he privately told House Republicans that he backed their legislation ""1,000 percent"" and would protect them during their campaigns, lawmakers said. By Friday, he was tweeting that ""Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration"" and wait until after the November elections, when he said the GOP would approve tougher legislation because it will gain strength in Congress. That proposition is dicey at best. \n \n ""I think that the best way to pass legislation is to consistently support a position and help move it forward,"" Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, a senior House Republican. Asked if Trump was doing that, Walden pivoted toward a door and said, ""I\'ll leave it at that."" \n \n Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he talked to the White House on Saturday and ""they say the president is still 100 percent behind us."" \n \n The bill would make citizenship a possibility for ""Dreamer"" immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. when young. It would also finance Trump\'s aspirational $25 billion wall with Mexico and curb government agencies from wrenching migrant children from detained parents. \n \n The measure is the product of weeks of bargaining between party conservatives and moderates. Even so, the two GOP factions have been unable to resolve their final differences and vote-counters have yet to round up a majority. Republicans are getting no help from Democrats, who uniformly oppose the legislation. \n \n The GOP divisions come at a bad time for the party: Elections are approaching and immigration has riveted public attention for months. Republicans who are battling to retain House control have hoped to focus this fall\'s campaigns on the economy and tax cuts. \n \n Instead, Republican blockades against ending deportations of young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children were major news earlier this year. In recent days, the focus has shifted to the Trump administration\'s wrenching of migrant children from their parents. \n \n Neither of those have been good looks for Republicans from swing districts with large numbers of moderate voters — the very incumbents who must be re-elected for the GOP to retain House control. \n \n Lawmakers said leaders wanted to round up GOP votes by adding provisions requiring companies to verify workers\' citizenship, which conservatives like. They would also ease restrictions on seasonal migrant workers, a priority for farm-district, moderate Republicans. \n \n Until now, party leaders have hesitated to include those items because they could end up costing votes, not gaining them. Moderate Republicans don\'t like the citizenship verification requirement and some conservatives don\'t like helping immigrants stay in the U.S. \n \n Another problem is the two additional provisions don\'t address the major reason for GOP defections: Conservatives say helping Dreamers stay in the U.S. is handing amnesty to lawbreakers. \n \n ""I\'m a \'no,\'"" said Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. He said he couldn\'t defend helping the Dreamers ""to people waiting in line the right way"" to immigrate to the U.S. \n \n The House defeated a more conservative immigration alternative last week. \n \n GOP leaders said the House will vote on its compromise immigration bill despite Trump\'s flashing red light on the subject. \n \n Top Republicans have wanted to hold the votes, win or lose, partly to defuse an effort by GOP moderates to force the chamber to vote on liberal-leaning bills helping immigrants win citizenship. Those measures could pass the House backed by Democrats and a few Republicans, an outcome that would enrage conservative voters. \n \n In addition, some Republicans are eager for roll calls to show voters back home that they\'ve tried to address the issue. \n \n ""I think it\'s important that the House be able to show we can take the action,"" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \n \n __ \n \n AP writer Ken Thomas contributed.', '?We need people who will help to Make America Great Again!,"" President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Trump: \'We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country\' \n \n President Donald Trump on Sunday continued escalating his rhetoric about migrants, tweeting, “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country.” \n \n The president wrote on Twitter: ""When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came,” presumably confusing “bring” with “send” in that instance. “Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Trump and allies have increasingly used dehumanizing terms to describe immigration, including language like ""infest."" At times, his harsh words have been reserved for MS-13 gang members, but in other instances he is not specific as to what he is talking about and conflates migrants coming across the border with the brutal gang. \n \n “Immigration must be based on merit — we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!” he said in his next tweet. \n \n The president and his administration have been under intense criticism since the new ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy led to the separation of families apprehended after crossing the border illegally. Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that he said would end the practice, but former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said Sunday that order will likely be overturned by the courts. \n \n As he did last week, Trump complained about the role of judges and the court system in the U.S. immigration process. Since illegal immigration is a federal crime — a misdemeanor for a first instance of illegal border crossing and a felony for someone who has been deported who illegally enters the United States again — the process is handled at the federal level by immigration judges. \n \n The U.S. has an expedited removal process that allows for relatively fast deportation proceedings for people who enter the country illegally, but only if they are citizens of Canada or Mexico. Trump wants to change that. \n \n But the president seemed to call Sunday for denying due process to people apprehended after crossing the border illegally, and he did not seem to draw a distinction for people who arrive at ports of entry seeking asylum, as are many of those now coming from violence-plagued Central American nations. America is party to treaties that govern the treatment of asylum seekers and non-asylum seekers. \n \n An American Civil Liberties Union official blasted Trump\'s statement, saying the president was suggesting an ""illegal and unconstitutional"" policy change. \n \n ""Any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. \n \n Josh Gerstein contributed to this report.']",2,"– After a week of outrage over child separation at the southern border and a subsequent executive order that claims to stop it, President Trump is again using pointed rhetoric to describe the immigration crisis in America. In a Sunday string of tweets, Trump blasted Democrats, telling them to ""fix the laws"" while praising his own administration for being better than those of Bush or Obama at handing the complex issue. In that same tweet, Trump connected illegal immigration with crime on this side of the border. ""Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!"" he tweeted. As Politico notes, Trump and his supporters have frequently used controversial language when describing undocumented immigrants, specifically when invoking the MS-13 gang. The president did not mention the street gang in Sunday's tweets. However, Trump did say that ""We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country ... we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came."" As of May, federal immigration courts had a backlog of over 700,000 cases and some courts were scheduling hearings after 2021. Per AP, Republican apprehension over Trump's habit of sending off fiery and unpredictable tweets about the hot button issue and their fear of riling conservative voters are undermining GOP leaders' election-year struggle to shove an immigration bill through the House this week. Party leaders are trying to finally secure the votes they need for their wide-ranging bill with tweaks they hope will goose support from the GOP's dueling conservative and moderate wings."

Please try again later.', 'SEOUL (Reuters) - The Seoul government has released rare video footage of Korean women forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War Two, the first time moving images have been shown of the “comfort women”. \n \n A government-funded research team from Seoul National University found the footage, which was filmed in 1944 by an American soldier, in the United States National Archives after a two-year hunt. \n \n “South Korea has not had its own data on comfort women and (has) been relying on Japanese and American data,” said Kang Sung-hyun, an academic on the team. \n \n “It is crucial for South Korea to have our own data for the issue of comfort women,” he said. \n \n The 18-second black-and-white clip shows seven women lined up outside a brick house, being questioned by Chinese soldiers. The women were found by U.S.-China allied forces in China’s Yunnan province, the research team said in a statement. \n \n The women were registered by U.S. soldiers, the research team said. Two of the women in the video had already appeared in previously released photos of “comfort women”. \n \n The term is used to describe girls and women from South Korea, China, the Philippines and elsewhere, who were forced into prostitution in Japanese wartime military brothels. \n \n South Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean victims. \n \n Japan and South Korea agreed to resolve the issue “finally and irreversibly” in 2015 if all conditions were met. Japan made an apology and promised one billion yen ($8.84 million) for a fund to help victims. \n \n However, the issue continues to strain relations between the two countries. \n \n Japan wants South Korea to remove a statue near the Japanese consulate in Busan city commemorating Korean comfort women, as well as another near the Japanese embassy in Seoul, saying that the presence of the statues violates the 2015 agreement. \n \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in suggested during his campaign for a May 9 election that most South Koreans did not accept the 2015 deal negotiated by his conservative predecessor Park Geun-hye and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, and that he could try to renegotiate it. \n \n Since the election, he has not directly addressed whether he will seek to renegotiate the pact. The issue is likely to be discussed when he meets Abe on Friday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption First known footage of \'comfort women\' \n \n South Korea has released what it says is the first known footage of ""comfort women"" forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during World War Two. \n \n Filmed by US troops in China, the clip was found by government-funded researchers at Seoul National University in US archives. \n \n The 18-second clip shows several women lined up talking to a Chinese soldier. \n \n South Korean activists estimate 200,000 women were forced into brothels for Japan\'s military. \n \n They are believed to have been mainly from Korea, but also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. \n \n Some of the women were willing, others were lured with the offer of paid work as cooks or cleaners and many were forced, a UN report said. \n \n Until now, the only records of women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War Two had been photographs and survivor testimonials. \n \n Image copyright US National Archives Image caption The issue has long been a strain on ties between South Korea and Japan \n \n The research team says the footage was filmed by joint US-Chinese troops in China\'s Yunnan province which was previously occupied by Japan. \n \n The seven Korean women were freed in 1944 and the officer speaking with them has been identified as a Chinese captain of the China-US Combined Force, the team said. \n \n The issue has long strained the relationship between South Korea and Japan over a perceived lack of adequate apology and compensation from Japan. \n \n In 2015, the two countries reached a settlement whereby Tokyo formally apologised and agreed to pay 1bn yen ($8.3m, £5.6m) to fund victims. \n \n Many Koreans though viewed the apology as insufficient and the issue continues to plague ties. \n \n In January, Japan temporarily withdrew its ambassador to South Korea over a ""comfort women"" statue placed outside the Japanese consulate in Busan. \n \n A similar statue has also been placed outside Japan\'s consulate in Seoul, and Tokyo wants both these statues to be removed. \n \n Correction 31 July 2017: This article has been amended to make it clear that not all the ""comfort women"" were coerced.']",3,"– It's just 18 seconds long, but a new video released by South Korean researchers makes history for the worst of reasons. The clip shows Korean ""comfort women"" held as sex slaves by the Japanese military, reports the BBC. It's believed to be the first such film clip known to exist, though images of ""comfort women"" had previously surfaced in still photographs. The good news is that the video shows the women after US and Chinese troops arrived to free them in China's Yunnan province in 1944. A research team from Seoul National University found the footage in the US National Archives after a two-year search, reports Reuters. An American soldier is believed to have filmed the scene, in which a Chinese officer talks to the women lined up in front of a building used as a brothel. Japan forced an estimated 200,000 women to work as sex slaves for its soldiers during World War II. (Earlier this year, South Korea angered Japan with a statue honoring the women.)"

They made about ten times the money they asked for, and I was one of the top-level backers. \n \n I got my oculus rift dev kit, and played around with it. It was convincing. It presented a lot of design problems. It made me nauseous. It was signed by the entire Oculus Rift team. I got super excited and worked on a couple of prototypes before moving on to other things. Perhaps I would pick it up again closer to the consumer version release. \n \n A couple of weeks ago, they reminded me that I still hadn’t visited their office, one of the rewards from the kickstarter. John Carmack would be there. The combined opportunity of seeing their latest tech and getting to talk about vr (and doom) with John was overwhelming, so I took the 12+ hour flight there. What I saw was every bit as impressive as you could imagine. They had fixed all the major issues, and all that remained was huge design and software implementation challenges. \n \n As someone who always felt like they were born five or ten years too late, I felt like we were on the cusp of a new paradigm that I might be able to play around with. I could be part of the early efforts to work out best practices, and while I have no doubt that in ten years we’ll look back at the problems with early VR applications in the same we look back at GUI problems with early PC games, it still felt exciting to me. My head started spinning with potential applications and how to deal with all the issues (how do you do gui? how do you deal with locomotion? what input do you use? what happens if the player leans far enough forward to clip into a wall? how do you prevent vr induced existential crisis?) \n \n Of course, they wanted Minecraft. I said that it doesn’t really fit the platform, since it’s very motion based, runs on java (that has a hard time delivering rock solid 90 fps, especially since the players build their own potentially hugely complex levels), and relies a lot on GUI. But perhaps it would be cool to do a slimmed down version of Minecraft for the Oculus. Something free, similar to the Minecraft PI Edition, perhaps? So I suggested that, and our people started talking to their people to see if something could be done. \n \n And then, not two weeks later, Facebook buys them. \n \n Facebook is not a company of grass-roots tech enthusiasts. Facebook is not a game tech company. Facebook has a history of caring about building user numbers, and nothing but building user numbers. People have made games for Facebook platforms before, and while it worked great for a while, they were stuck in a very unfortunate position when Facebook eventually changed the platform to better fit the social experience they were trying to build. \n \n Don’t get me wrong, VR is not bad for social. In fact, I think social could become one of the biggest applications of VR. Being able to sit in a virtual living room and see your friend’s avatar? Business meetings? Virtual cinemas where you feel like you’re actually watching the movie with your friend who is seven time zones away? \n \n But I don’t want to work with social, I want to work with games. \n \n Fortunately, the rise of Oculus coincided with competitors emerging. None of them are perfect, but competition is a very good thing. If this means there will be more competition, and VR keeps getting better, I am going to be a very happy boy. I definitely want to be a part of VR, but I will not work with Facebook. Their motives are too unclear and shifting, and they haven’t historically been a stable platform. There’s nothing about their history that makes me trust them, and that makes them seem creepy to me. \n \n And I did not chip in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition. \n \n I have the greatest respect for the talented engineers and developers at Oculus. It’s been a long time since I met a more dedicated and talented group of people. I understand this is purely a business deal, and I’d like to congratulate both Facebook and the Oculus owners. But this is where we part ways. \n \n If you want to experience Minecraft in VR, there’s an excellent mod that does this. It’s called Minecrift, and you can find it here.', 'By now, we know that the reaction to a major Facebook acquisition among the chattering technorati follows a pretty simple script. It happened with Instagram in 2012, it happened again last month with WhatsApp, and it happened yet again Tuesday with the $2 billion deal for the virtual reality gurus at Oculus VR. \n \n First comes the stage where we all have a good laugh. Facebook bought what now? For how much? No. Seriously? What are they smoking in Menlo Park? The memes and jokes fly thick and fast. We comb our cultural history for anything that matches the pattern of an accurate prediction. The Oatmeal called it. The Simpsons called it. \n \n Then Zuckerberg will get on the phone with analysts and journalists, and explain very matter-of-factly why the purchase is worth whatever he paid for it — not now, but many years in Facebook\'s future. He makes an awful lot of sense: yes, virtual reality probably is the next big platform after mobile. There are murmurs of unease. Crap, Zuck was right about Instagram, he\'s probable right about this. \n \n See also: Mark Zuckerberg Casually Conquers the World \n \n A few hours later later, after the value of the technology or app in question has had time to sink in, comes the full-blown freakout. Zuckerberg is no longer a dolt; Zuckerberg must be stopped. Facebook is going to turn us into drooling zombies. You\'re going to be full-time immersed into a Matrix-style virtual-reality ""Planet Facebook"" filled with manipulative corporate sponsors while keeping your body alive by sucking on a ""QuenchTube"" through a ""small nipple in your mouth,"" suggested Verge editor Josh Topolsky. \n \n Hey, I\'m as much of a sucker for a good sci-fi scenario as the next futurist, but let\'s get real about this one. That\'s just not how the future happens. If you want to talk about technologies that were supposed to turn us into drooling idiots, try television. Try games consoles. If you look at them objectively, as numerous studies have done, it turns out those technologies are actually pretty good at informing us and improving our reactions. (See: Everything Bad is Good For You.) \n \n Yeah, but Facebook\'s going to ruin Oculus Rift, right? They\'re going to plaster it with ads and make it focus on gaudy, commercial apps that help its bottom line? Well, no. Facebook has a history of funding its big purchases well and letting them run themselves independently, like the world\'s luckiest startups. Look at Instagram: Kevin Systrom is firmly in charge, user numbers are skyrocketing, and the service has barely begun to introduce sponsored photos, which it may well have had to do by now anyway. (See: every app that wanted to make money ever.) \n \n Look at WhatsApp: founder Jan Koum staked his word on the fact that Facebook will not touch WhatsApp user data, ever. You know why that\'s guaranteed? Because if it doesn\'t happen, Zuckerberg won\'t be able to convince the next hot startup that he wants to buy that he isn\'t just blowing smoke when he says they\'ll be independent. \n \n Zuck is playing a wider game here, and the stakes are high. If Facebook ever got a reputation among the Silicon Valley community for being a rapacious corporate monster that goes back on its word and forces you to do so as well — well, there would be a few more giant companies around here that they\'d much rather sell to. \n \n Okay, you say, but surely there\'s some pressure that will be applied, pressure to put friend requests here, or targeted ads there — subtle backroom pressure that Oculus VR\'s leadership won\'t be able to withstand. To which I say: have you met John Carmack, Oculus\' CTO? I interviewed Carmack half a dozen times over the last decade and a half, back to when he was the mastermind behind Quake and Doom. The two words I invariably used to describe him are ""evil"" and ""genius."" \n \n Carmack never does anything by half-measures. He built his own space startup, for crying out loud. He\'s in the Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos realm of influence. If it ever came down to corporate politics, he\'d give that young whippersnapper Zuck a run for his money. Come to think of it, I\'d even put a small wager on Carmack taking over Facebook from within. \n \n Facebook could buy an awful lot of goodwill for the cost of 3 engineers by refunding the 9500 Oculus Kickstarter backers their $2.5 million. — Anil Dash (@anildash) March 26, 2014 \n \n I do agree with entrepreneur and blogger Anil Dash, above, that Facebook would do well to address the fact that Oculus VR began as a Kickstarter company. The payout would be an elegant solution, so long as it isn\'t seen as a crass bribe, and who knows — it may convince the creator of Minecraft to stop freaking out about Facebook. \n \n It would also encourage more Kickstarter campaigns, annointing the crowdfunding service as a legitimate form of venture capital, which would be a rising tide that lifts all Silicon Valleys boats (except for its established VCs, who may freak out themselves). \n \n But it\'s not something Facebook needs to do, legally or even ethically. Oculus fulfilled its obligations to its backers long ago. If its backers thought it would never do any of the things a for-profit company does, perhaps they missed the part where it became a for-profit company. Perhaps they missed the hiring, last year, of the evil genius. Besides, again, they\'re missing the point. \n \n Weep not, for the Oculus you know is not dead. Dry your eyes, because you ain\'t seen nothing yet through them. The number one reason why Oculus ""sold out"" to Facebook: because this way, it can remain independent and improve exponentially — first and foremost, in bringing down the cost and the size of those clunky headsets, and encouraging way more developers to join the platform. \n \n I\'ve tried Oculus a number of times, and really like the demo app where you zoom around the solar system. But even that felt a bit too low-res; all I could think was it\'ll be nice when it\'s finished. But Oculus was stuck paying way too much money for way too little gadgetry; now it has purchasing power, and how. What happened Tuesday was one giant leap into Oculus\' future. \n \n Not convinced? Read the Reddit threads where Oculus founder Palmer Luckey is taking on all-comers. ""I am not going to close off, I am 100% certain that most people will see why this is good in the long term,"" he writes. ""Any change at Oculus will be for the better."" He lists three short-term reasons why, in as much detail as he can: \n \n 1) We can make custom hardware, not rely on the scraps of the mobile phone industry. That is insanely expensive, think hundreds of millions of dollars. More news soon. \n \n 2) We can afford to hire everyone we need, the best people that fit into our culture of excellence in all aspects. \n \n 3) We can make huge investments in content. More news soon. \n \n Where will this end? Not in Topolsky\'s dystopian vision, but where all technology ends up — in the casual mundanity of everyday life as you pretty much know it, just one step removed. It ends with ""honey, have you seen my Oculus glasses?"" \n \n It ends with you using them the same way you\'d use Skype — zipping in and out of the virtual world for meetings, making it much easier to work from home or catch up with far-flung family. \n \n It ends with you donning your Oculus glasses about as frequently as you\'d use your Xbox or PlayStation. Games nerds will be addicted; the rest of us will use it every now and then, for fun. \n \n That\'s not a very sexy story to tell, granted; fearful future freakouts are so much wilder. If you simply don\'t trust Facebook because it\'s had a hard time communicating its privacy settings, if you don\'t trust Oculus to stand firm in the unlikely scenario that they\'re strong-armed, if you think the combination of the two is the beginnings of The Matrix, then knock yourself out. \n \n Just be aware that the sci-fi reality you\'re spinning with that story is as unreal and unlikely as anything you\'d see in VR.', 'William Wei, Business Insider Facebook is buying Oculus VR, a startup that makes virtual reality headsets, in a $2 billion deal. \n \n Oculus doesn\'t make a consumer product yet, but its headset called the Oculus Rift for video game developers has completely changed the way many feel about video games. \n \n The device is nearly impossible to describe. It makes you feel like you\'re truly immersed in a virtual environment. It\'s one of those things you have to try to fully understand. And we guarantee it\'ll blow your mind. \n \n Console gaming companies have sensed the threat of Oculus, which is why Sony announced a similar headset for its new PlayStation 4 gaming console. However, it\'s unclear when Sony\'s headset will launch. \n \n The question now is: why would Facebook buy a video game hardware company? \n \n According to a statement from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the company plans to expand Oculus beyond gaming: \n \n After games, we\'re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home. \n \n Zuckerberg expanded on that in a conference call following the announcement, saying he believes virtual reality will be the next big computing platform after mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. \n \n ""History suggests that there will be more platforms to come,"" Zuckerberg said on the conference call, adding that the person who controls that major computing platform will be able to shape the entire tech industry. \n \n ""Today\'s acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing,"" Zuckerberg said. \n \n Oculus got its start on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, where it raised $2.4 million in 2012. Since then, other VCs have invested in the company. Most recently, Oculus raised $75 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Marc Andreessen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Facebook board member, tweeted today that he recused himself from acquisition talks between Facebook and Oculus VR. \n \n Last summer, Business Insider spoke with Oculus VR\'s 21-year-old founder Palmer Luckey about how he came up with the device. He got started at a young age, tinkering with all kinds of computerized headsets. You can read the full interview here. \n \n By the way, this isn\'t Facebook\'s only recent major acquisition. Just a few weeks ago, Facebook bought WhatsApp in a $19 billion deal. \n \n Here\'s Zuckerberg\'s full statement on the deal: \n \n I\'m excited to announce that we\'ve agreed to acquire Oculus VR, the leader in virtual reality technology. \n \n Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. For the past few years, this has mostly meant building mobile apps that help you share with the people you care about. We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we\'re in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next to enable even more useful, entertaining and personal experiences. \n \n This is where Oculus comes in. They build virtual reality technology, like the Oculus Rift headset. When you put it on, you enter a completely immersive computer-generated environment, like a game or a movie scene or a place far away. The incredible thing about the technology is that you feel like you\'re actually present in another place with other people. People who try it say it\'s different from anything they\'ve ever experienced in their lives. \n \n Oculus\'s mission is to enable you to experience the impossible. Their technology opens up the possibility of completely new kinds of experiences. \n \n Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won\'t be changing and we hope to accelerate. The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there\'s a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. We\'re going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this. \n \n But this is just the start. After games, we\'re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home. \n \n This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures. \n \n These are just some of the potential uses. By working with developers and partners across the industry, together we can build many more. One day, we believe this kind of immersive, augmented reality will become a part of daily life for billions of people. \n \n Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction. But the internet was also once a dream, and so were computers and smartphones. The future is coming and we have a chance to build it together. I can\'t wait to start working with the whole team at Oculus to bring this future to the world, and to unlock new worlds for all of us. \n \n Here\'s the press release from Facebook: \n \n Facebook today announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, Inc., the leader in immersive virtual reality technology, for a total of approximately $2 billion. This includes$400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock (valued at $1.6 billion based on the average closing price of the 20 trading days preceding March 21, 2014 of $69.35 per share). The agreement also provides for an additional$300 million earn-out in cash and stock based on the achievement of certain milestones. \n \n Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company\'s virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus\' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas. Given these broad potential applications, virtual reality technology is a strong candidate to emerge as the next social and communications platform. \n \n ""Mobile is the platform of today, and now we\'re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,"" said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. ""Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate."" \n \n ""We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,"" said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR. ""We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. It is a transformative and disruptive technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it\'s only just the beginning."" \n \n Oculus will maintain its headquarters in Irvine, CA, and will continue development of the Oculus Rift, its ground-breaking virtual reality platform. \n \n The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2014. \n \n Want more?

"['Google might be a lot of things today -- a provider of mobile software with its Android operating system, a social network provider with Google+ -- but today it\'s announcing that it continues to make its core search engine better. \n \n Google\'s new Knowledge Graph is a new search tool that will begin rolling out starting today. It\'s meant to help you find search results faster. When you now search for a popular or well-known person, place or thing, you\'ll get a box to the right of the results explaining more about your search term. \n \n For instance, search for ""Frank Lloyd Wright"" today and the first link might be to Wikipedia. But now, to the right of that result you\'ll see some of that Wikipedia or other sourced information right on the search page, including a short summary of who Wright was, his birth date, etc. You\'ll also get related searches. If Wright were still living and a Google+ user, you\'d also get his Google+ profile link. \n \n ""The knowledge graph has been constructed using a lot of reliable sources of information, including the World CIA Fact Book, Wikipedia, etc. We also collect content of our own, like Google Books,"" Shashidhar Thakur, Google\'s Tech Lead in Search, told ABC News. \n \n Thakur said a team at Google has been working on the Knowledge Graph for two years. They have built a database with 500 million people, places and things, and there are 3.5 billion defining attributes and connections, which include those related searches and other information. \n \n Google says you\'ll start seeing the Knowledge Graph box as often as you see Google Maps, making it its largest search launch ever. It says it has surpassed the launch of Google Image and Google News in terms of the data available on its first day. Obviously, the database will continue to grow. \n \n One of the most interesting things about the Knowledge Graph is its understanding of search terms. Take the word ""Kings."" When you search ""Kings"" now it might think you\'re talking about the ice hockey team, the ""Kings"" TV show, or those medieval kings. Now the Knowledge Graph box, located to the right of the results, will give you those options. When you click one it will take to you the search results for that specific ""Kings"" search term, and you\'ll get another Knowledge Graph box -- this time with information about the specific ""Kings"" search. \n \n While Google\'s Knowledge Graph tries to focus on reliable sources of information, the company continues to make search more social. Google has recently tied Google +, its own social network, into search results. \n \n Google+ updates from friends now appear in search results, and Vic Gundotra, Google\'s senior VP of social business, has even said that Google+ is the future of Google. ""In the new Google, we know your name, we understand your circles, and we make every service better,"" Gundotra said at SXSW in March. The Knowledge Graph will include the Google+ profiles if you search for someone who happens to be in the Knowledge Graph database and has a Google+ profile. \n \n This week Microsoft began rolling out the newest version of its Bing search pages, which include social network information, including related Tweets and Facebook updates. \n \n Google\'s Knowledge Graph feature will begin to roll out in the next few days. It will be available on regular desktop search as well as on mobile and tablet versions.', ""Note: By submitting this form, you agree to Third Door Media's terms . We respect your privacy . \n \n Hinted at for months, Google formally launched its “Knowledge Graph” today. The new technology is being used to provide popular facts about people, places and things alongside Google’s traditional results. It also allows Google to move toward a new way of searching not for pages that match query terms but for “entities” or concepts that the words describe. \n \n Knowledge Graph? “Graph” is a technical term used to describe how a set of objects are connected. Google has used a “link graph” to model how pages link to each other, in order to help determine which are popular and relevant for particular searches. Facebook has used a “social graph” understand how people are connected. “Knowledge Graph” is Google’s term for how it is building relationships between different people, places and things and report facts about these entities. \n \n Big Change, Subtle Appearance \n \n Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal wrote about the coming change. At the time, I felt what was described seemed more an extension of things Google had already been doing rather than a dramatic shift. Now having seen it first-hand, I stand corrected. The WSJ had it right. This is indeed a big change in line with other major launches like Search Plus Your World last January and Universal Search in 2007. \n \n Big change, but I don’t think it’ll be a shocking change to most Google users who will begin seeing it over the coming days on Google.com, if they’re searching in US English. \n \n Google will still look largely the same as it does now. Knowledge Graph information flows into new units — they have no official name (and I did ask), so I’ll call them “knowledge panels.” These panels appear to the right of Google’s regular results, rather than disrupt those familiar links: \n \n Knowledge panels don’t always appear, only showing up only when Google deems them relevant. But when Google does think they’re relevant, they’re a pretty cool search exploration tool. When the head of Google Search, Amit Singhal, let me play with the new system following his keynote talk at our SMX London show yesterday, I couldn’t help but think of it like a form of StumbleUpon or channel surfing for search. \n \n Fact Surfing \n \n A search for Star Trek brought up a panel that included a reference to Star Trek: Voyager, my favorite of all the series. Jumping to explore that, the Voyager box included a reference to Babylon 5, another favorite sci-fi show of mine. Jumping to that box, there was a reference to Claudia Christian, who wonderfully played one of the main characters in Babylon 5, Susan Ivanova. I surfed over for a look. \n \n If you’ve ever started reading a Wikipedia page and then gotten lost jumping from one topic to another, that’s the experience I think many are about to discover with Google. You’ll not only discover answers to factual questions, but you’ll likely quickly explore more than you had planned and have fun doing it. \n \n 3.5 Billion Facts About 500 Million Objects \n \n Google says it has compiled over 3.5 billion facts, which include information about and relationships between 500 million objects or “entities,” as it sometimes calls them. In general, entities are persons, places and things. You know, nouns. \n \n In particular, these are just some of the categories of objects Google has facts about: \n \n Actors, Directors, Movies \n \n Art Works & Museums \n \n Cities & Countries \n \n Islands, Lakes, Lighthouses \n \n Music Albums & Music Groups \n \n Planets & Spacecraft \n \n Roller Coasters & Skyscrapers \n \n Sports Teams \n \n Again, those are just some of the categories. The relationships are also as important as the facts. The relationships allow the Knowledge Graph to know which actors to list for a particular movie or which spacecraft have visited a planet. \n \n The Most Popular Facts \n \n How do you keep from getting overwhelmed with useless facts? Google picks out the facts for each object that are most sought in relation to that object. \n \n “We are showing all the things that people look for in a given query,” Singhal told me. \n \n Consider these two knowledge panels, one for Simpson’s creator Matt Groening, the other for architect Frank Lloyd Wright (you can click to enlarge): \n \n For both, you’re told when they were born and where they were educated. After that, the remaining facts shown differ. \n \n Only Groening has facts about his parents and siblings listed. Why? Look closely at the names: Margaret (Marge), Homer, Lisa. Groening named characters after his own family. Looking at searches related to Groening, Google can tell these are commonly sought answers. \n \n For Groening, the books he’s authored are listed. For Wright, his famous buildings are. That makes sense. People are far more interested in structures by Wright than by books by him. Indeed, Google’s autocomplete suggestions — which are based on the most popular terms related to a core search topic — reflect this: \n \n I found it fascinating to see what was shown, as I ran through various classes of searches. For Disneyland, popular rides were shown. For a ride like Space Mountain, the duration was shown (really, only 3 minutes?). For an astronaut, I was shown the missions and overall time they’d spent in space (how cool to have that as a fact about yourself). For Buckingham Palace, the size of floor space was listed. For Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg, their estimated net worth was shown. \n \n Each knowledge panel has a “People also search for” area at the bottom which lists related people, places or things. Again, the relationships are determined by looking at search data. People who search for Groening, for example, often search for David X. Cohen, who co-created Futurama with Groening. \n \n For search marketers, or anyone interested in how people search, these panels have become another great discovery resource along with keyword research tools like Google Trends, Google Insights, Google Correlate or the AdWords Keyword Tool. \n \n Facts But Not Actions \n \n One thing I found lacking was that the knowledge panels I saw often lacked links to let people take actions related to these objects. For example, one of the popular things people want in relation to Buckingham Palace is to book tickets for tours. However, the panel had no options for this. \n \n In contrast, the new “Snapshots” announced (but still about a week from going live) as part of Bing’s relaunch last week are heavy on trying to help people do things like book tickets or reservations. \n \n Why not have actions? \n \n “We will, of course, explore that, but right now, we just want to take it out and see how it works,” Singhal said. \n \n Occasionally you can take actions via the links to some of the source providers of facts, as with some music searches that might credit Songkick or StubHub. \n \n Which Andromeda Did You Mean? \n \n For some searches, there may be more than one entity that Google has facts for related to a search. In these cases, rather than make the wrong guess, Google will put up a “See results box” as shown below for Andromeda: \n \n Andromeda could mean, in Google’s Knowledge Graph, the galaxy, the TV show or the Swedish band. This box, also known as a disambiguation box, allows people to make the right choice. \n \n Where Do The Facts Come From? \n \n How does Google know any of these facts? Google Squared was an initial attempt in 2009 to extract facts from the web. Google still has that technology, but the service was never that impressive on accuracy and closed as standalone site last year. \n \n Rather, it was Google’s purchase of Metaweb in 2010 that really jump-started the Knowledge Graph. Metaweb was building both the relationships and, though Freebase, a database of facts. \n \n Since that time, Singhal said Google’s massively grown the fact database. Contributions happen with Freebase, but data also comes from publicly-available sources like Wikipedia and The CIA World Factbook and even information out of Google Books. Beyond that, Google also licenses data from others. \n \n “Wherever we can get our hands on structured data, we add it,” Singhal said. \n \n Fixing Bad Data \n \n Drawing from Wikipedia and other public sources means that there’s no guarantee that the facts are accurate. That’s why the knowledge panels on Google all have a “Report a problem” link at the bottom. \n \n If you click on that, you can then indicate if any particular fact is incorrect. Singhal said that Google will use a combination of computer algorithms and human review to decide if a particular fact should be corrected \n \n If Google makes a change, the source provider is told. This mean, in particular, Wikipedia will be informed of any errors. It doesn’t have to change anything, but apparently the service is looking forward to the feedback. \n \n “They really are excited about it. They get to get feedback from a much bigger group of people,” Singhal said. \n \n Will Publisher Traffic Drop? \n \n Search engines have increasingly moved toward showing direct answers in their results over the years. Such efforts have worried some publishers, leaving them wondering if they’ll be left out of receiving search traffic. After all, if search engines provide answers right within their results, why would anyone click away? \n \n Google’s Knowledge Graph is going to massively increase the number of direct answers shown, which will almost certainly renew concerns. \n \n Singhal’s response is that publishers shouldn’t worry. He said that most of these types of queries, Google has found, don’t take traffic away from most sites. Part of this seems to be that the boxes encourage more searching, which in turn still eventually takes people to external sites. \n \n Still, some are going to lose out, he admits. But he sees that as something that was going to happen inevitably, anyway, using a “2+2” metaphor. If people are searching for 2+2, why shouldn’t Google give a direct answer to that versus sending searchers to a site? By the way, Google does do math like this already and has for years. \n \n Below, you can hear Singhal talk more about this when asked by a member of the audience at SMX London yesterday: \n \n My concern is what happens if publishers have compiled great information that someone at Wikipedia or Freebase harvests into a database. For example, if a Disneyland fan site has organized a list of ride durations by doing original legwork, what credit do they get if that data is used? Facts can’t be trademarked, at least in the US, so anyone can help themselves assuming they don’t duplicate the exact format or presentation. \n \n Google does list credit links to places like Wikipedia. In turn, Wikipedia does give credit (albeit in a way that doesn’t help search rankings) to the sources it draws from. But that puts actual source material two clicks away from the searcher, assuming the searcher wants to go beyond the fact they already received. \n \n This is one that has to be watched closely. As I wrote before, it seems likely the Knowledge Graph will impact a relatively small set of sites that focus on facts, sites that already likely exposing answers in their listing descriptions and so not getting traffic anyway. But we’ll see. \n \n It’s also important to remember that the “main” results aren’t disappearing. Consider again the Frank Lloyd Wright search, this time with the knowledge panel in context with the regular results: \n \n As you can see, links to sites outside of Google remain to the left and in the most viewed area of a search results page. \n \n Being Included \n \n What if you want to be part of the new knowledge panels and Knowledge Graph in general? Singhal said that at the moment, there’s no mechanism designed for sites to do this. IE, if you run a site about Frank Lloyd Wright, there’s no way to be associated as some type of suggested source for the Frank Lloyd Wright panel. \n \n Potentially, you could head over Freebase, open an account and contribute. Of course, I’m pretty sure adding your blog to a horrible list of blogs like this isn’t going to help. Maybe other categories might be more successful, but I’d hold off, for the moment. \n \n Tagging parts of your pages with commonly used schema might be helpful, though I wouldn’t do this solely in hopes of getting your facts into the Knowledge Graph. The articles below have more about using schema: \n \n Ads, Mobile & Tablet Formats \n \n Anyone familiar with Google’s ads will immediately wonder what happens when the panel shows. \n \n Singhal said that if there are also ads along with a knowledge panel for any search, the ads will still display. Google also has different formats for when a query has a few, many or no ads. I haven’t seen these, but I’ll try to update as they become visible after the launch. \n \n In addition, Google also uses special formats to make the panels work well on tablet and mobile devices, he said. They aren’t restricted to just desktop search, so that’s good news for those of you who want an easier time to cheat at pub and bar quiz nights. \n \n Sadly, there’s no way to just search the Knowledge Graph directly. It only appears with regular Google Search. \n \n The Competition \n \n Google’s not alone in having a knowledge graph, of course. Wolfram Alpha, launched in 2009, has continued to refine its service. It got a big boost being picked as a search partner by Apple to help power Siri (even though that recently embarrassed Apple on a particular search about smart phones). \n \n As for Bing, it has a partnership with Wolfram Alpha plus owns Powerset technology that, somewhat similar to the Knowledge Graph, tries to deeply understand the meanings of words, rather than just really match patterns of letters. \n \n But Bing hasn’t really seemed to capitalize on either its Wolfram partnership nor Powerset. Really, the Knowledge Graph seems to be going more head-to-head with Wolfram Alpha. Does it? \n \n “Wolfram is far more computational,” Singhal said, explaining that Wolfram Alpha’s goal seems to be finding ways that you can effectively use facts in computations. \n \n For example, you can enter cars in california / california population into Wolfram Alpha to have it take those two facts and come up with an average (about 1 car for every two people, by the way, using 2009 data). \n \n Google’s not trying to perform these types of calculations. The focus is instead on providing popular facts. \n \n The Future \n \n The big picture, of course, is that some day the Knowledge Graph won’t just be used for facts. Instead, if Google can better tag actual web pages to entities, then it can better understand what those pages are about and related to, which might increase the relevancy of its regular results. \n \n That’s down the line, as are many other changes to the knowledge panel themselves. Today represents only a start. \n \n “This is just a baby step, in my view, to expose this to our users,” Singhal said. \n \n To learn more about the Google Knowledge Graph, see coverage from others across the web organized here on Techmeme, the official Google blog post, plus the official video, below: \n \n Related Articles""]",2,"– Google is rolling out a major new change to its search engine today—the Knowledge Graph. When a user searches for a famous person, place, or thing, a box will pop up on the side of the screen offering a concise list of relevant facts, reports ABC News. Google's database for the new tool includes 500 million people, places, and things combined with 3.5 billion items of information and connections. You'll see info boxes for everything from movies to cities to roller coasters to planets to lighthouses, writes Danny Sullivan at Search Engine Land. ""Big change, but I don’t think it’ll be a shocking change to most Google users who will begin seeing it over the coming days on Google.com, if they’re searching in US English."" Adds Liz Gannes at AllThingsD: ""At least on an interface level, Microsoft is on a similar track with Bing—where it just launched custom panels for results in 150 categories. But what Google is doing goes quite a bit deeper."""
"['Submitting to an examination slightly less intense than Rudy faced on the average episode of The Cosby Show, Bill Cosby appeared on today’s Good Morning America, where ABC bragged he would at last “break his silence” on the more than 40 allegations of sexual assault he has refused to dignify with an answer, or anything approaching dignity. This promise proved to be true in that noise is the opposite of silence, and Cosby did indeed make noises in the general vicinity of the accusations. But for anyone expecting a direct response—or even coherence—they left disappointed. \n \n The muddling began with ABC News’ Linsey Davis, who was formally there to talk to Cosby about his education reform campaign in Alabama. Likely wanting to avoid another NPR or Associated Press situation, Davis attempted to frame her question in the form of a hypothetical child who might want to know whether the accusations are true, because “my mom says you’ve done some bad things.” From the mouths of babes, and not ABC reporters, and so forth. \n \n Cosby’s reply was every bit as convoluted: \n \n \n \n I am prepared to tell this young person the truth about life. I’m not sure that they will come like that. I think that many of them say, “Well, you’re a hypocrite. You say one thing, you say the other.” My point is, okay, listen to me carefully. I’m telling you where the road is out. I’m telling you where, as you’re driving, you’re gonna go into water, and it looks like it might only be three inches deep, but you and your car are gonna go down. Now you wanna go here? Or you wanna be concerned about who’s giving you the message? \n \n Though this resembled some sort of Voight-Kampff test to determine whether you have a conscience, the message was (sort of) clear: You should ignore the many rape allegations against Cosby, if you care at all about your car. Also, that the message is more important than the messenger, even if that message is total gibberish. \n \n Pressed as to whether being accused by more than 40 women of drugging and raping them—in accounts whose graphic details are now permanently etched in the American psyche—might “overshadow” his message about not driving in puddles or whatever, Cosby offered more Dadaist poetry in response. It was a bit like e.e. cummings, if e.e. cummings were accused of multiple counts of rape: \n \n i’ve been in this business (52) years i’ve never seen anything like this and reality is the situation and i i can’t speak \n \n Cosby was also asked, “What would you like your legacy to be?”—a simple question to which Cosby might have answered, “Well, not being an accused serial rapist,” and thereby justified ABC’s claims to have actually gotten somewhere. Instead, he rambled some more about TV shows he wants to make: \n \n I really know about what I want to do tomorrow, in the tomorrows that follow. I have a ton of ideas to put on television for a series about people and their behavior and their love for each other. \n \n No one wants any of Bill Cosby’s ideas. \n \n Send your Newswire tips to tips@avclub.com', 'Bill Cosby is responding to questions about allegations of sexual assault for the first time in an exclusive interview with ABC News’ Linsey Davis. \n \n Interested in ?

I’m telling you where, as you drive, you are going to go into the water. Now, you want to go here or you want to be concerned about who is giving you the message?\'” \n \n More than 30 women have come forward in the past six months, some accusing Cosby of drugging or sexually assaulting them. His legal team has issued a number of denials. Cosby has never been criminally charged. Three of his accusers have filed a defamation lawsuit against him, which Cosby is trying to get dismissed. \n \n In an effort to turn the page, Cosby is now part of an initiative to bring awareness about the state of underfunded schools near Selma, Alabama. But will the allegations overshadow his message? \n \n “It’s interesting. When I talk to people they will say, ‘This is a situation that’s unprecedented.’ I, my family, my friends, I have been in this business 52 years,"" he said. ""I’ve never seen anything like this. And reality is the situation. And I can’t speak.” \n \n Cosby has been invited to walk across the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge with students as part of a “March for Education.” The program is hosted by the Black Belt Community Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to improving the lives of citizens in a 12-county section of Alabama known as the “Black Belt” area. \n \n Cosby’s participation sparked an online firestorm, something that organizers admit made them think twice about his involvement. \n \n “We had some very rich discussions about it, but at the end of the day what was most important was: How do we make sure the world knows that Black Belt children matter?” said Felecia Lucky, the organization’s president. \n \n Cosby, whose long career has included his portrayal of Cliff Huxtable on “The Cosby Show,” still talks about the possibility of a return to TV. \n \n “I really know about what I want to do tomorrow -- in the tomorrows that follow,” he told Davis. “I have a ton of ideas to put on television for a series about people and their behavior and their love for each other.”', 'Bill Cosby says that in all of his years in show business, he\'s ""never seen anything like"" his situation after being accused by multiple women of sexual assault. \n \n The comedian appeared on Good Morning America on Friday to promote a non-profit organization, the Black Belt Community Foundation, which aims to improve education for children in high-poverty counties near Selma, Ala.

By the dozens, women have come forward to allege that Cosby sexually assaulted them. But while their words have filled op-eds and interviews and press conferences, Cosby, for the most part, has refused to comment. \n \n Yet Cosby came face-to-face with the allegations again in a new interview with Good Morning America‘s Linsey Davis, a conversation which was ostensibly about Cosby’s work with the Black Belt Community Foundation but, in the clips released to the public thus far, focus almost entirely on Cosby’s reputation as a serial rapist. \n \n During the interview, Davis asked Cosby, “Are you prepared for backlash? If a young person comes up to you and says, ‘My mom says you’ve done some bad things,’ how will you answer them? If they are pressing you, ‘Are you guilty? Did you do it? Are the allegations true?'” \n \n Cosby’s reply: \n \n I am prepared to tell this young person the truth about life. I’m not sure that they will come like that. I think many of them say, well, you’re a hypocrite. You say one thing, you say the other. My point is, okay, listen to me carefully. I’m telling you where the road is out.

Now, you want to go here, or you want to be concerned about who is giving you the message? \n \n There was this pause after the word “truth.” You could be forgiven for getting hopeful in that moment: “I am prepared to tell this young person the truth.” But, no. And it seems rather optimistic of Cosby to assume that this hypothetical young person would say “You’re a hypocrite” and not “You’re a serial rapist.” \n \n Davis then asked, “Are you concerned at all that, given the allegations, that may overshadow your message?” \n \n “I’ve been in this business 52 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Cosby said. “And reality is the situation. And I can’t speak.” \n \n Forty women have publicly condemned Cosby for sexually assaulting them. The accusations span decades. You’ve never seen anything like this, Cosby? What a coincidence, neither has anyone else. \n \n \n \n \n \n It is kind of amazing that, after all this time, Cosby still responds to questions about these allegations as if he is surprised and scandalized by their existence. Obviously, he knows this barrage of rape accusations is newsworthy and that any reasonable reporter will ask what, if anything, he wants to say in response. How does he not just have a boilerplate, go-to reply? He always appears to be scrambling for something vague and not-incriminating to say. His failure to have a clear dismissal-and-denial strategy calls to mind his sloppy written response to the revived allegations last fall: his ever-changing legal team, his contradictory statements. \n \n Davis asked Felecia Lucky, president of the Black Belt Community Foundation, if the rape allegations “were enough to make you think twice about inviting Mr. Cosby?” Cosby will speak to hundreds of high school students in Demopolis and Selma and participate in the “March for Education” across the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge. Lucky acknowledged that she had second thoughts but decided “at the end of the day, what is most important was, how do we make sure the world knows the Black Belt children matter.” \n \n Could Cosby’s participation, even on behalf of a good cause, shed a positive light on anything at the moment? In just six months, his reputation has fallen from mostly-beloved public figure to likely predator. His name, in association with the word “mentor,” scans as so absurd to a modern audience it is, literally, a joke. \n \n And there is something especially disconcerting about the notion of Cosby spending a lot of intimate time with young people, considering the fact that Judy Huth, one of Cosby’s alleged victims, was 15 years old at the time of her assault. (A representative from the Black Belt Foundation, reached this morning by phone, said no one would be available to comment on this story.) \n \n When Davis asked Cosby what he wants his legacy to be, Cosby shook his head and said, “I have a ton of ideas to put on television about people and their love for each other.” \n \n This, again, demonstrates a willful obliviousness to reality: Cosby might want to be on television, but television has made it quite clear that it wants nothing to do with Cosby. TV Land yanked all the Cosby Show reruns from the air last November; NBC killed a Cosby project that was still in its early stages; Netflix shelved comedy special Bill Cosby 77, which was slated to premiere on Nov. 27 of last year, indefinitely. Multiple theaters have canceled his scheduled appearances. \n \n Off-screen, Cosby resigned, presumably under pressure, from the Temple University Board of Trustees, and was stripped of his honorary chief petty officer designation by the Navy. \n \n But Cosby has made a point of continuing to perform wherever and whenever he is able to do so, keeping up his tour with the trolling title of “Far From Finished.” When over 14,000 people signed a petition protesting Cosby’s April 27 show at the Cobb Center in Atlanta, Cosby posted a 19-second video to assure fans that “I’m going to perform because I love it when you laugh.” \n \n His determination to stay on stage might not be enough to overcome the latest accusation, which could result in Cosby facing criminal charges. Actress Lili Bernard said that Cosby raped her in New Jersey, where there is no statute of limitations on sexual assault. Bernard came forward at a press conference hosted by Gloria Allred two weeks ago, the day after she reported her assault to the Atlantic City Police Department. \n \n GMA is hyping the interview by claiming Cosby is responding to allegations for “the very first time,” even though Cosby has actually addressed them before. Last December, he told a Page Six reporter that he “only expect[s] the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism.” During an interview with the Associated Press on Nov. 6, Cosby issued a brief “no comment” to questions about his alleged assaults and then tried to bully the AP reporter into not showing the interview footage: “If you want to consider yourself to be serious, it will not appear anywhere.” \n \n This is about as close as Cosby gets to “responding” to the dozens of allegations against him: in this elliptical, I’m-the-real-victim-here sort of way. So his latest comments aren’t too surprising, even though they are disappointing and frustrating and, no matter how closely you read them, incomprehensible.""]",4,"– Bill Cosby has generally been avoiding saying anything at all about the rape allegations against him, but he went on ABC's Good Morning America today and agreed to talk at least a little about them: “It’s interesting.

The balloon, called Two Eagles, is equipped with several types of radios, a high-tech navigation system, and basics like food and a first-aid kit. The men will wear oxygen masks and stay bundled up in the 50-degree cabin as they fly at an expected altitude of at least 15,000 feet. It's possible the pilots could be in flight for as many as 10 days, the balloon's apparent outer limits, and it's not clear where they'll come down. ""That’s going to keep us on the edge of our seats for this mission,"" says Hill. Bradley and Tiukhtyaev are also being monitored by Arizona State University researchers studying fatigue's effects on cognition. (Check out this recent balloon ride that didn't go as planned.)"

"['Leader appears on state TV briefly to signal defiance in the face of mounting revolt against his 41-year rule. \n \n There have been widespread reports that Libyan soldiers have used live ammunition on protesters [Reuters] Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has appeared on state television to signal his defiance in the face of a mounting revolt against his 41-year rule. \n \n \n \n ""I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela. Do not believe the channels belonging to stray dogs,"" Gaddafi told Libyan state TV, which said he was speaking outside his house on Tuesday. LIVE BLOG On Monday, William Hague, the British foreign minister, had suggested that Gaddafi had fled to Venezuela, a report that the government of that country denied. Gaddafi, in his first televised appearance since protests to topple him began last week, was holding an umbrella in the rain and leaning out of a van. \n \n \n \n ""I wanted to say something to the youths at the Green Square (in Tripoli) and stay up late with them but it started raining. Thank God, it\'s a good thing,"" Gaddafi said in a 22-second appearance. \n \n \n \n State TV reported earlier that pro-government demonstrations were taking place in Green Square in the capital. \n \n \n \n Libyan forces loyal to Gaddafi have fought an increasingly bloody battle to keep the veteran leader in power with residents reporting gunfire in parts of the capital Tripoli and warplanes reportedly bombing protesters. Scores of people have been reported killed in continuing violence in Tripoli amid escalating protests across the north African nation. ""In a sense this is a pariah regime that will not have any chance of governing anymore and the international community could come to terms on whether this is a genocide and whether there should be international intervention to protect the Libyan people from the militias of the regime,"" said Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera\'s senior political analyst. \n \n \n \n ""We\'ve heard even a NATO spokesman saying that the Libyan regime should stop committing war crimes against its people so I think there is momentum out there but certainly it\'s not quick enough."" Deep cracks were showing and Gaddafi seemed to be losing vital support, as Libyan government officials at home and abroad resigned, air force pilots defected and major government buildings were targeted during clashes in the capital. At least 61 people were killed in the capital city on Monday, witnesses told Al Jazeera. Protesters called for another night of defiance against the Arab world\'s longest-serving leader, despite a crackdown by authorities \'Unacceptable bloodshed\' Libya\'s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Ibrahim Dabbashi, spoke to Al Jazeera Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has said it is ""time to stop this unnacceptable bloodshed"" in Libya. \n \n \n \n A group of army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to ""join the people"" and help remove Gaddafi. \n \n \n \n The justice minister resigned in protest at the ""excessive use of violence"" against protesters and diplomats at Libya\'s mission to the United Nations called on the Libyan army to help overthrow ""the tyrant Muammar Gaddafi"". \n \n \n \n Both Libya and Venezuela denied reports that Gaddafi had fled to the South American country. Two Libyan fighter jets landed in Malta, their pilots defecting after they said they had been ordered to bomb protesters, Maltese government officials said. Libyan authorities have cut all landline and wireless communication in the country, making it impossible to verify many reports. With reports of large-scale military operations under way in Tripoli, a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said the UN chief held extensive discussions with Gaddafi on Monday, condemned the escalating violence in Libya and told him that it ""must stop immediately”. UN, Arab League meetings The UN Security Council will hold a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in Libya, diplomats said. \n \n \n \n They said the meeting, referred to as ""consultations"", had been requested by Ibrahim Dabbashi, the Libyan deputy ambassador, and would start at 1400 GMT. \n \n \n \n Dabbashi and other diplomats at Libya\'s mission to the UN on Monday said they sided with protesters in Libya. \n \n \n \n Earlier, Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani, Qatar\'s prime minister and foreign minister, called for an extraordinary meeting of the Arab League to take place on Tuesday. \n \n \n \n The aim is to discuss the current crisis in Libya and to put additional ""pressure"" on the government, Al-Thani told Al Jazeera. He said the international community must act now. ""I feel a big sympathy for the Libyan people. We don\'t accept using force in this way or any way against the people or against any nation from their governments,"" he said. The comments came just hours after Ahmed Elgazir, a human-rights researcher at the Libyan News Centre (LNC) in Geneva, Switzerland, told Al Jazeera that security forces were ""massacring"" protesters in Tripoli. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Ahmad Jibreel, a Libyan diplomat, confirmed that the justice minister, Mustapha Abdul Jalil, had sided with the protesters. Jibreel further said that key cities near Libya\'s border with Egypt were now in the hands of protesters, which he said would enable the foreign media to enter the country. Meanwhile, the Egyptian military on Tuesday said it was reinforcing the border with Libya, but that it would leave it open throughout the day for those who require medical or other assistance. The army says it has set up two field hospitals and camps to receive Egyptians and Libyans who cross the border into Egypt.', 'A suggestion that Gadhafi may have fled was fueled when British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he had ""some information"" the dictator was heading for Venezuela. \n \n U.K.-based opposition activist Ahmed Sawalem, who is keeping in touch with protesters in Libya, told msnbc.com that there were reports of planes bombing a weapons store south of Benghazi in Ajdabiya ""so the protesters cannot get hold of them, to use them to fight."" He said a number of people in the area were thought to have been killed in the attack. \n \n Sources said the fighter pilots defected because they would not fire on the Tripoli protesters. \n \n They had left from a base near Tripoli and had flown low over Libyan airspace to avoid detection. They arrived shortly after two civilian helicopters carrying seven people claiming to be French landed after a flight from Libya. \n \n Fighter pilots claim asylum Reuters reported that two Libyan fighter jets flown by Libyan air force colonels were granted permission to land in Malta after asking for political asylum. \n \n A group of Libyan army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to ""join the people"" and help remove Gadhafi, Al Jazeera reported on Monday. \n \n Communications into the capital appeared to have been cut, and mobile phones of residents could not be reached from outside the country. State TV showed images of hundreds of Gadhafi supporters rallying in central Green Square Monday evening, waving pictures of the Libyan leader and palm fronds. \n \n Snipers had taken position on the roofs of buildings around Tripoli, apparently to stop people from outside the capital from joining the march, according to Mohammed Abdul-Malek, a London-based opposition activist in touch with residents. \n \n Gadhafi\'s regime appeared to be preparing a new major assault in the capital Monday night. State TV at nightfall announced that the military had ""stormed the hideouts of saboteurs"" and called on the public to back the security forces as protesters called for a new demonstration in central Green Square and in front of Gadhafi\'s Tripoli residence. \n \n ""But I think Gadhafi is going to put up a fight ... in Libya more than any other country in the region, there is the prospect of serious violence and outright conflict,"" he said. \n \n ""These really seem to be last, desperate acts. If you\'re bombing your own capital, it\'s really hard to see how you can survive, "" said Julien Barnes-Dacey, Control Risks\' Middle East analyst. \n \n An analyst for London-based consultancy Control Risks said the use of military aircraft on his own people indicated the end was approaching for Gadhafi. \n \n One of Gadhafi\'s sons, Seif al-Islam, has vowed that his father and security forces would fight ""until the last bullet."" \n \n ""The toll is also likely to rise because of the shortage of medicine which the country is facing,"" the statement said. \n \n The International Federation for Human Rights said in a statement Monday that at least 300 to 400 people had been killed since Feb. 15, citing the Libyan League for Human Rights, which is a member of the federation. \n \n The accounts came as deep cracks opened in Gadhafi\'s regime, with diplomats abroad and the justice minister at home resigning, air force pilots defecting and a fire raging at the main government hall after the clashes in the capital Tripoli. Protesters called for another night of defiance in Tripoli\'s main square despite the government\'s heavy crackdown. \n \n Another man, identified only as “Victory,” told msnbc.com after touring Tripoli, “We could hear firing every 15 minutes, I don’t know from where really.” \n \n ""Our people are dying. It is the policy of scorched earth,"" he said. \n \n ""What we are witnessing today is unimaginable,"" Adel Mohamed Saleh, an activist in the capital, told Al Jazeera television. His accounts could not be independently confirmed. ""Warplanes and helicopters are indiscriminately bombing one area after another. There are many, many dead. \n \n Gadhafi spoke hours after reports that Libyan military aircraft fired live ammunition at crowds of anti-government protesters in Tripoli on Monday. \n \n ""I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela. Don\'t believe those misleading dog stations,"" he said, referring to media reports that he had left the country. \n \n Gadhafi was seated in the passenger seat of a small vehicle holding an umbrella up through the open door. It had been raining in the capital for two days. His remarks were aired about 2 a.m. local time (7 p.m. Monday ET). \n \n Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared for less than a minute Tuesday morning on state television and made brief remarks to say he was in the capital Tripoli and to deny rumors he had fled to Venezuela amid the violent revolt against his 41-year rule. \n \n However, a senior government source in Caracas denied that and a U.K. official said Hague had been referring only to unconfirmed media reports. \n \n Leaders break with Gadhafi \n \n Libya\'s ambassadors at the United Nations called for Gadhafi to step down as the country\'s ruler. Deputy Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi said Monday that if Gadhafi does not relinquish power, ""the Libyan people will get rid of him."" \n \n The staff of Libya\'s mission to the United Nations declared allegiance to the people of Libya, instead of to Gadhafi, a spokesman said Monday. \n \n ""The members of the Libyan mission are representing only the Libyan people and not anyone else,"" the spokesman, Dia al-Hotmani, said by telephone. \n \n Justice minister Mustafa Abdel-Jalil reportedly resigned from his post to protest the ""excessive use of force against unarmed protesters."" \n \n The Libyan ambassador to the United States also said he could no longer support Gadhafi, and the ambassador to India resigned. Almost all Libyan diplomats at the United Nations backed deputy ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi\'s pleas to Gadhafi to end his 40-year rule and to the international community to intervene. \n \n A Libyan diplomat in China, Hussein el-Sadek el-Mesrati, told Al-Jazeera, ""I resigned from representing the government of Mussolini and Hitler."" \n \n Libya\'s former ambassador to the Arab League in Cairo, Abdel-Moneim al-Houni, who a day earlier resigned from his post to side with protesters, issued a statement demanding Gadhafi ""be put on trial along with his aides, security and military commanders over the mass killings in Libya."" \n \n ""Gadhafi\'s regime is now in the trash of history because he betrayed his nation and his people,"" al-Houni said. \n \n The U.N. spokesperson\'s office said late Monday that the Security Council had scheduled consultations on the situation in Libya for Tuesday morning. \n \n Earlier, Dabbashi had said he was writing to the Security Council calling for action to stop the bloodshed. \n \n As diplomatic support for Gadhafi began to crumble, Dabbashi warned that if he doesn\'t leave, ""the Libyan people will get rid of him."" \n \n Celebration in Benghazi \n \n Protesters celebrated in the streets of the country\'s second largest city, Benghazi, claiming they were in control after days of bloody fighting and after anti-government unrest. Celebrating protesters raised the flag of the country\'s old monarchy, toppled in 1969 by a Gadhafi-led military coup, over Benghazi\'s main courthouse and on tanks around the city. \n \n ""Gadhafi needs one more push and he is gone,"" said Amal Roqaqie, a lawyer at the Benghazi court, saying protesters are ""imposing a new reality ... Tripoli will be our capital. We are imposing a new order and new state, a civil constitutional and with transitional government."" \n \n Cars honked their horns in celebration and protesters in the streets chanted ""Long live Libya."" \n \n There were fears of chaos as young men — including regime supporters — seized weapons from the Katiba and other captured security buildings. ""The youths now have arms and that\'s worrying,"" said Iman, a doctor at the main hospital. ""We are appealing to the wise men of every neighborhood to rein in the youths."" \n \n Youth volunteers were directing traffic and guarding homes and public facilities, said Najla, a lawyer and university lecturer in Benghazi. She and other residents said police had disappeared from the streets. \n \n After seizing the Katiba, protesters found the bodies of 13 uniformed security officers inside who had been handcuffed and shot in the head, then set on fire, said Hassan, also a doctor. He said protesters believed the 13 had been executed by fellow security forces for refusing to attack protesters. \n \n Rage in Tripoli \n \n The capital was largely shut down, with schools, government offices and most stores closed, as armed members of pro-government organizations called ""Revolutionary Committees"" circulated in the streets hunting for protesters in Tripoli\'s old city, said one protester, named Fathi. \n \n During the day Monday, a fire was raging at the People\'s Hall, the main hall for government gatherings where the country\'s equivalent of a parliament holds its sessions several times a year, the pro-government news web site Qureyna said. \n \n The man identified as ""Victory"" told msnbc.com that telephone service went down at around 3 p.m. local time. \n \n He said he saw helicopters overhead and a column of six tanks as he traveled through the city in the afternoon. He said for the most part the streets were empty of residents, but he came across security forces with machine guns. \n \n Among the buildings attacked by protesters was the Ministry of Defense headquarters on Omar El Mokhtar Street, which was on fire, he said. \n \n At 7:45 p.m. he said he saw military planes flying near the ground, close enough to see that they were full of passengers. \n \n The man, who spoke to msnbc.com from the home he shares with his parents and four sisters and brothers, denied that the country was in the midst of a civil war. \n \n “The situation on the streets is not a war,” he said. “The people don’t have anything, they use rocks, sometimes knives. We don’t have guns, we don’t have anything to fight them with.” \n \n He said the residents of Tripoli were especially angered and frightened by the presence of what he called African militias brought in to fight protesters. \n \n The last straw for many people was the speech Sunday night by Gadhafi ‘s son. \n \n “The people, they want freedom,” he said. “Maybe 10 years ago, 20 years ago they would have listened. But not now — I don’t think we can accept that anymore … his father is not welcome in Libya anymore.” \n \n The government “has fallen,” he said. “Gadhafi is not good for Libya.” Protesters planned new marches in the central Green Square and at the leader\'s residence for Monday evening. \n \n Sunday evening, protesters from various parts of the city streamed into Green Square, all but taking over the plaza and surrounding streets in the area between Tripoli\'s Ottoman-era old city and its Italian-style downtown. That was when the backlash began, with snipers firing down from rooftops and militiamen attacking the crowds, shooting and chasing people down side streets, according to several witnesses and protests. \n \n Gadhafi supporters in pickup trucks and cars raced through the square, shooting automatic weapons. ""They were driving like mad men searching for someone to kill. ... It was total chaos, shooting and shouting,"" said one 28-year-old protester. \n \n The witnesses reported seeing casualties, but the number could not be confirmed. One witness, named Fathi, said he saw at least two he believed were dead and many more wounded. After midnight, protesters took over the main Tripoli offices of two state-run satellite stations, Al-Jamahiriya-1 and Al-Shebabiya, one witness said. \n \n Fight \'to the end\' \n \n “The overwhelming sentiment among Libyans is, ‘prepare to see this fight for our freedom to the end,’” Tarik Yousef, dean of the Dubai School of Government and a Libyan-American, told msnbc.com. “This is a 42-year dictatorship of the worst possible kind.” \n \n “I think what happened in Libya is to some extent connected with what happened in Egypt and Tunisia,"" Yousef said. ""There has been a huge contagion effect running across the three countries. The demonstration of the capacity of the public to effect change is a huge factor in what has happened.” \n \n “I think this is an historic moment from the perspective of modern Arab history,"" Yousef said. ""I can’t go back to the modern period and find a moment that resembles this kind of widely expressed people’s power movement that we see at the moment.” \n \n Yousef has family in Benghazi and friends in Tripoli. \n \n “The conditions for disintegration of the regime base are there,” Yousef said, noting the resignations of diplomats, the Libyan mission to the United Nations staff distancing itself from Gadhafi, and even the flying of the Libyan flag of independence at the Libyan Embassy in London. \n \n “All of these are developments that suggest that a lot of the power base of the regime is slowly disintegrating and crumbling.” \n \n “When you have tribes that have access to oil installations within their vicinity and can in fact affect the supply of oil — threaten to use that — that’s another source of weakening of the regime.” \n \n \n \n International alarm \n \n Gadhafi\'s regime has unleashed the bloodiest crackdown of any Arab country against the wave of protests sweeping the region, which toppled the leaders of Egypt and Tunisia. \n \n U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke to Gadhafi Monday by telephone, expressing deep concern over the escalating violence and saying it must stop immediately, a statement obtained by NBC News said. \n \n The U.S. State Department ordered all embassy family members and non-emergency personnel in Libya to leave the nation, NBC News reported. It also urged Americans to delay travel to Libya or if already there to use extreme caution. \n \n Violence and looting could continue for several days, it warned. \n \n The White House said on Monday that it was analyzing Seif\'s speech to see what offers of meaningful reform it contained, NBC News reported. \n \n Seif promised ""historic"" reforms in Libya if protests stop, and on Monday state TV said he had formed a commission to investigate deaths during the unrest. Protesters ignored the vague gestures. \n \n Officials would seek more information from Libyan officials and reiterate the White House\'s call for the Libyan government to avoid using violence against those protesting peacefully and respect their rights, NBC added. \n \n British Prime Minister David Cameron, visiting neighboring Egypt, called the Libyan government\'s crackdown ""appalling."" \n \n ""We can see what is happening in Libya which is completely appalling and unacceptable as the regime is using the most vicious forms of repression against people who want to see that country — which is one of the most closed and one of the most autocratic — make progress. The response they have shown has been quite appalling,"" he told reporters in Cairo. \n \n The European Union on Monday sharply criticized Libyan authorities. The EU foreign ministers condemned ""the ongoing repression against demonstrators in Libya and deplores the violence and death of civilians,"" said a statement released after the regular monthly meeting of the bloc\'s 27 foreign ministers. \n \n EU President Herman Van Rompuy said in a separate statement he was ""horrified by the growing number of human casualties among demonstrators."" \n \n Fragmentation is a real danger in Libya, a country of deep tribal divisions and a historic rivalry between Tripoli and Benghazi. The system of rule created by Gadhafi — the ""Jamahiriya,"" or ""rule by masses"" — is highly decentralized, run by ""popular committees"" in a complicated hierarchy that effectively means there is no real center of decision-making except Gadhafi, his sons and their top aides. \n \n Seif has often been put forward as the regime\'s face of reform and is often cited as a likely successor to his father. Seif\'s younger brother Mutassim is the national security adviser, with a strong role in the military and security forces, and another brother Khamis heads the army\'s 32nd Brigade, which according to U.S. diplomats is the best trained and best equipped force in the military. \n \n Oil price jumps \n \n The spiraling turmoil in Libya, an OPEC country that is a significant oil supplier to Europe, was raising international alarm and pushing oil prices sharply higher. \n \n The oil price jumped $4.13 to $90.13 a barrel in the U.S. market for crude on fear the unrest could disrupt supplies. \n \n Two leading oil companies, Statoil and BP, said they were pulling some employees out of Libya or preparing to do so. \n \n Portugal sent a plane to pick up its citizens and other EU nationals and Turkey sent two ferries to pick up construction workers stranded in the unrest-hit country. \n \n EU foreign ministers were discussing on Monday the possible evacuation of European citizens. Mobs attacked South Korean, Turkish and Serbian construction workers at various sites around the country, officials from each country said. \n \n Benghazi\'s airport was closed, according to an airport official in Cairo. A Turkish Airlines flight trying to land in Benghazi to evacuate Turkish citizens Monday was turned away, told by ground control to circle over the airport then to return to Istanbul.']",2,"– The rumors of Moammar Gadhafi's Venezuelan vacation are greatly exaggerated: The embattled Libyan leader made a bizarre, minute-long appearance on state TV at 2am local time, declaring, ""I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela. Do not believe the channels belonging to stray dogs."" Gadhafi appeared in a small vehicle, reports MSNBC, and was holding an umbrella; it has rained heavily in Tripoli for two days. Gadhafi may not have fled, but his regime is crumbling around him, with diplomats and a minister resigning, pilots who were ordered to fire on protesters defecting, and reports of up to 160 dead in the chaos.

"[""For Mitt Romney, the 2012 election was held about a year too early. \n \n Romney would hold a slight lead on President Obama if the 2012 election were replayed today, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. \n \n The poll of registered voters shows Romney at 49 percent and Obama at 45 percent in the rematch, a mirror image of Romney's four-point (51-47) popular-vote loss in 2012. \n \n Obama's shifting fortunes, of course, come as his signature health-care law is increasingly embattled -- both thanks to a glitchy Web site and a broken promise by Obama to allow people who like their insurance to keep it. \n \n Obama's loss of support is spread across many demographics, but he has suffered most among the young, the less-educated, the poor and, perhaps most interestingly, among liberals. \n \n To wit: \n \n * Obama won women in 2012 by 11 points, according to exit polls; today he leads by one point. \n \n * He has seen his lead among young voters (18-39 years old) drop from 18 percent to 2 percent. \n \n * His four-point lead among those with less than a college degree has flipped to a nine-point deficit. \n \n * Among those making less than $50,000, Obama's 22-point lead is now three points. \n \n * The biggest drop is among those professing to have no religion. While this group backed Obama by 44 points, it now supports him by a 22-point margin. \n \n * Among liberals, Obama won by 75 points but now leads by 59 percent. One in five self-described liberals (20 percent) say they would vote for Romney. \n \n This all comes with a few caveats. \n \n 1. This poll, obviously, is hypothetical. People know there isn't another election between Romney and Obama and may be more willing to change their opinion from the 2012 vote. \n \n 2. This doesn't necessarily mean Romney would win the race today. There is, of course, the margin of error and the fact that that the Electoral College -- and not the popular vote -- elects the president. \n \n That said, an eight-point shift in the popular vote, spread across the entire country, would have netted Romney an additional 10 states and 125 electoral votes in 2012. That would mean he would have won the race 331-207 -- virtually the same margin as Obama's 332-206 win. \n \n The Post-ABC poll was conducted Nov. 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,006 adults, including interviews on landlines and with cellphone-only respondents. The overall margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

In a new gauge, just 41 percent rate him as a good manager; 56 percent think not. \n \n This poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that the president\'s personal image has suffered alongside his professional ratings. Fewer than half, 46 percent, see him favorably overall, down 14 points this year to the fewest of his presidency. Fifty-two percent now view him unfavorably, a new high and a majority for the first time since he took office. It may matter: Personal popularity can provide a president with cushioning when the going gets rough. Losing it leaves the president more vulnerable. \n \n ACA - Skepticism about the Affordable Care Act looks to be the driving force in Obama\'s troubles. Americans by nearly 2-1, 63-33 percent, disapprove of his handling of implementation of the new health care law. And the public by 57-40 percent now opposes the law overall, its most negative rating to date, with opposition up by 8 points in the past month alone. \n \n Intensity of sentiment is running against the law and the president alike. At 46 percent, ""strong"" opposition to the ACA - a new high - outpaces strong support by a record 19 points. In terms of Obama\'s job performance overall, strong critics outnumber strong approvers by 2-1, 44-22 percent, with strong disapproval at another career high. He\'d run evenly on strong sentiment as recently as last May. \n \n Fifty-six percent describe the cancellation of health insurance policies that are deemed substandard under the law as ""mismanagement"" rather than a normal startup problem. Given the breakdown of the healthcare.gov website, a broad 71 percent favor postponing the individual mandate requiring nearly all Americans to have coverage. And the mandate\'s still widely unpopular in any case; 65 percent of Americans oppose it - a majority of them, strongly. Notably, even among those who support the individual mandate. 55 percent favor delaying it. \n \n The poll produces evidence that the ACA could spell trouble for Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections. Americans by a 16-point margin, 37-21 percent, are more likely to oppose than to support a candidate for Congress who favors Obamacare. That\'s opened up from an even score in July 2012. (Using an intensity rating - those who are ""much"" more or less likely to support a candidate who backs the ACA - it\'s still 15 points negative, vs. 2 points last year.) \n \n The health care law looks most politically hazardous in the states that backed Mitt Romney in 2012; there Americans by 3-1, 46-15 percent, say they\'re more inclined to oppose than to support a candidate who favors the law. But the ACA\'s no help even in the blue states that backed Obama; while the division is far closer, 31 percent in those states are inclined to oppose an ACA-linked candidate, vs. 25 percent who\'d be more apt to support one. \n \n For all the ACA\'s troubles, Americans divide evenly, 49-49 percent, on whether the law simply is unworkable or the government can recover and implement it successfully. While its individual mandate is widely opposed, 58 percent support its requirement that companies with 50 or more employees provide coverage or pay a fine. And fewer than half - though a still-troubling 44 percent - think Obama ""intentionally misled"" the public when he said that people who liked their policies could keep them. (For comparison, there were four occasions in 2005-6 when majorities said George W. Bush had ""intentionally misled"" the American public on Iraq.) \n \n TURN - The results overall represent a sharp turnaround in fortune for Obama and his party, which just a month ago were ascendant over the Republicans in views of the budget dispute that led to a partial government shutdown. Today 45 percent of Americans call Obama ""too liberal,"" matching the high, and 46 percent say the same about the Democratic Party. And perhaps adding insult to injury, registered voters divide numerically in Mitt Romney\'s favor, 49-45 percent, if they had a mulligan for the 2012 presidential election. While the difference between the two is within the poll\'s error margin, Obama\'s support is 6 points below his actual showing a year ago. \n \n Indeed, even with the stock market soaring and GDP and the jobs market gaining ground, disenchantment with Obama has damaged his most critical issue-specific approval rating, for handling the economy. Fifty-seven percent disapprove, up by 9 points since May and the most since March 2012. \n \n Partisanship on all this is profound: Eighty-four percent of Democrats approve of Obama\'s job performance overall, while a mere 8 percent of Republicans agree - a gap that matches the widest of Obama\'s presidency. \n \n Key, though, are views among political independents - and in this group just 33 percent now approve of Obama\'s work in office, while 63 percent disapprove. That\'s a career low for Obama among independents, down 21 points since January and 10 points in just the past month. \n \n Similarly showing damage in the center, Obama\'s dropped by 17 points in approval among moderates since January, to 46 percent, compared with his losses among conservatives and Republicans (down 12 and 9 points, respectively, albeit to a far lower level). \n \n At the same time, there\'s also one core support group in which Obama is hurting - young adults, a group he won by an historic margin in 2008, and strongly again in 2012. The president\'s overall approval rating has lost 23 points among adults age 18 to 29 since January, his steepest loss in any group. Their view that the country\'s headed in the wrong direction has gained 20 points since May. And in just the past month, opposition to the health care law has jumped by 16 points among under-30s, with strong opposition up by 21 points. \n \n For all this, about as many Americans call both the Republican Party and the Tea Party political movement ""too conservative"" - 43 and 40 percent, respectively - as call Obama and the Democrats too liberal. And the number who say the Tea Party has too much influence over the GOP has nearly doubled, from 23 percent in spring 2010 to 43 percent now. That suggests the Republicans haven\'t left the doghouse so much as Obama and the Democrats, courtesy of the troubled start of the new health care law, have joined them in it. \n \n METHODOLOGY - This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone Nov. 14-17, 2013, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,006 adults, including landline and cell-phone-only respondents. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including design effect. Partisan divisions are 31-24-37 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents. \n \n The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y.']",2,"– Just how bad are things for President Obama a year into his second term? So bad that if the American people got a mulligan on the 2012 election, there's a good shot we'd be looking at a President Romney. A Washington Post-ABC News poll reveals that if the election were held today, Obama would lose the popular vote 45% to 49%. While the Post reminds us that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, is the ultimate decider, it notes that spread roughly mirrors the 4 points Obama actually won by, and reflects plummeting support from his key demographics: Obama won women by 11 points; now, his edge is down to one point. He won voters aged 18-39 by 18 points; that's down to two. He won voters earning less than $50,000 by 22 points; it's down to three. He's now nine points in the hole with voters without a college degree, after winning them by four points. While he'd still win 59% of liberals, that's down from 75%—and 20% now say they'd vote for Romney. Obama's approval rating has fallen 13 points this year to 42%, tying its lowest mark ever in the poll. The culprit, as you might suspect, is at least in part the Affordable Care Act rollout, which 63% think has been handled poorly. The public now opposes the law itself 57%-40%, its worst numbers yet, and 71% favor delaying the individual mandate."
"['Judge Neil Gorsuch was on the list of judges that President Donald Trump promised he would choose from during the campaign. | AP Photo Trump picks Gorsuch for Supreme Court The 49-year-old federal appeals court judge would be the court\'s first conservative addition in a decade. \n \n President Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, elevating a 49-year-old judge who has served on a federal appeals court for more than a decade to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \n \n “When Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February, I made a promise to the American people: If I were elected president, I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court,” Trump said. “I promised to select someone who respects our laws and is representative of our Constitution and who loves our Constitution and someone who will interpret them as written.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Trump used his characteristic superlatives to introduce Gorsuch, calling him the “best” judge for the job and praising his credentials without expounding on the specifics of his legal philosophy. Trump even touted Gorsuch’s Ivy League pedigree — the kind of affiliations Trump has sometimes denigrated as breeding grounds for the out-of-touch elite. \n \n ""Mr. President, I am honored and I am humbled,"" Gorsuch said after being introduced. \n \n Trump’s sons Donald Jr. and Eric sat in the front row during the announcement. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, were also in attendance, as were a number of congressional leaders. Scalia’s widow, Maureen, was also in the audience. \n \n Gorsuch pledged that, if confirmed, he would serve as “a faithful servant of the constitution and laws of this great country.” \n \n “The Supreme Court’s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protections of the people’s liberties under law and to the continuity of our constitution — the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known,” Gorsuch said. \n \n In his remarks, Gorsuch praised Scalia. “Justice Scalia was a lion of the law. Agree or disagree with him, all of his colleagues on the bench cherished his wisdom and his humor. And like them, I miss him,” he said. \n \n Gorsuch was on the list of judges that Trump promised he would choose from during the campaign, and his selection to the high court is expected to rally conservative activists who successfully pushed Republicans to block hearings for Judge Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama’s pick, after Scalia’s death in February 2016. \n \n Gorsuch was appointed to the circuit court in 2006 by George W. Bush. He was confirmed by a Senate voice vote, meaning there were no objections to his confirmation but individual senators\' votes were not recorded. Trump touted Gorsuch as having been confirmed ""unanimously."" \n \n Gorsuch said he cherishes the traits he considers essential to a judge — “impartiality and independence, collegiality and courage” — and said he looks forward to his hearing before the Senate, which he called the “greatest deliberative body in the world.” \n \n Gorsuch’s statement provided some hints that he’s what legal scholars call an ""originalist"" or ""textualist,"" favoring a literal meaning of statutes and the Constitution. \n \n “I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order it is for Congress, and not the courts, to write new laws,” Gorsuch said. “It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome you reach is very likely a bad judge — stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.” \n \n View Who is Judge Neil Gorsuch? President Donald Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to fill the vacant seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \n \n And he made a nod to his religion: “I am so thankful tonight for my family, my friends and my faith,” he said. “These are the things that keep me grounded at life’s peaks and that sustain me in its valleys.” \n \n If confirmed, Gorsuch is unlikely to swing the ideological balance on the court. Legal experts see him as largely falling in line with the conservative bloc, as did Scalia. But, at 49, he would be the youngest justice on the court and represent an infusion of new blood into conservative ranks that have not seen an addition for a decade. \n \n Democrats have threatened to filibuster Trump\'s nominee, and the Senate\'s top Democrat criticized Gorsuch\'s record on Tuesday night. \n \n “The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. “Given his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch’s ability to meet this standard.” \n \n Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ed Markey of Massachusetts have all indicated they\'ll vote against the nominee. \n \n Senate Republicans praised Trump\'s pick and noted that Democrats had not blocked him from joining the appeals court. ""Eleven years ago, the Senate was so confident in Judge Gorsuch’s abilities that it confirmed him by voice vote,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). ""In the time since, he has shown himself worthy of that distinction, and I would hope that my Senate colleagues give him the respect he deserves this time around, as well, and support his confirmation.” \n \n Gorsuch has the typical pedigree of a high court justice. He graduated from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, clerked for two Supreme Court justices and did a stint at the Department of Justice. \n \n He attended Harvard Law with Obama. On Tuesday afternoon, Obama\'s former ethics czar, Norm Eisen, another classmate, tweeted: ""Hearing rumors Trump\'s likely Supreme Court pick is Neil Gorsuch, my (and President Obama\'s!) 1991 Harvard Law classmate.If so, a great guy!"" \n \n Since 2006, he has served on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and he is praised by conservative scholars for the clarity and force of his writing. \n \n “Neil Gorsuch is one of the most respected conservative originalist legal intellectuals of his generation,” said Jeffrey Rosen of the National Constitution Center. “He’s unusual for his memorable writing style, the depth of his reading and his willingness to rethink constitutional principles from the ground up. Like Justice Scalia, he sometimes reaches results that favor liberals when he thinks the history or text of the Constitution or the law require it, especially in areas like criminal law or the rights of religious minorities, but unlike Scalia he’s less willing to defer to regulations and might be more willing to second-guess Trump’s regulatory decisions.” \n \n Gorsuch is a favorite of legal conservatives because he has sharply questioned a three-decade-old legal precedent that many on the right believe has given too much power to the regulatory state. The landmark 1984 Supreme Court ruling involving the Chevron oil company held that courts should defer to federal agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. \n \n In a ruling last August in an immigration case, Gorsuch questioned the wisdom of that doctrine, arguing that the meaning of the law is for judges to decide, not federal bureaucrats. \n \n “Where in all this does a court interpret the law and say what it is?” Gorsuch asked in an extended digression on the subject. “When does a court independently decide what the statute means and whether it has or has not vested a legal right in a person? Where Chevron applies that job seems to have gone extinct.” \n \n Other rulings give conservatives confidence that Gorsuch is a strong supporter of religious freedom rights. Last September, he joined a dissent arguing that requirements for contraception coverage in Obamacare ran roughshod over the rights of religious nonprofits. \n \n View Trump picks Gorsuch for Supreme Court President Donald Trump picks Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court on Tuesday. \n \n Gorsuch also wrote a 2000 law journal article and a 2006 book arguing strongly against assisted-suicide laws. The practice of allowing the terminally ill to end their lives is now legal in six states and is on the verge of being legalized in Washington, D.C. \n \n Gorsuch was confirmed to the Denver-based appeals court by a voice vote. His confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to be contentious. Republicans hold a 52-48 advantage in the Senate, but Democrats, led by Schumer, are expected to force Republicans to muster 60 votes through a filibuster. \n \n Trump has suggested Republicans should eliminate the filibuster if Democrats use it, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been more circumspect about that idea, saying it remains up to the Senate, not the White House. \n \n Gorsuch has seen the grinder of Washington, D.C., up close. His mother, Anne Burford Gorsuch, ran the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan but resigned under pressure amid a criminal investigation and a House contempt of Congress citation over records related to alleged political favoritism in toxic-waste cleanups. \n \n She maintained her innocence and was never charged in the matter. \n \n Gorsuch is from Colorado. His supporters note that he is an outdoorsman who fishes, hunts and skies. On the court, conservatives hope he could become the intellectual heir to Scalia, long the outspoken leader of the conservative bloc. \n \n “The real appeal of Gorsuch\'s nomination is he’s likely to be the most effective conservative nominee in terms of winning over Anthony Kennedy and forging conservative decisions on the court,” Rosen said. “He clerked for Justice Kennedy, and they like and trust each other. If any nominee could sway Kennedy to conservative decisions, it would be Gorsuch.”', 'President Trump has announced Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado as his pick for the Supreme Court. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n President Trump has announced Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado as his pick for the Supreme Court. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n For nearly eight months, President Trump has boasted that appointing Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court ranks high among his signature achievements. \n \n But earlier this year, Trump talked about rescinding Gorsuch’s nomination, venting angrily to advisers after his Supreme Court pick was critical of the president’s escalating attacks on the federal judiciary in private meetings with legislators. \n \n Trump, according to several people with knowledge of the discussions, was upset that Gorsuch had pointedly distanced himself from the president in a private February meeting with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), telling the senator he found Trump’s repeated attacks on the federal judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralizing.” \n \n The president worried that Gorsuch would not be “loyal,” one of the people said, and told aides that he was tempted to pull Gorsuch’s nomination — and that he knew plenty of other judges who would want the job. \n \n It is unclear whether Trump’s “explosion,” as another administration official described it, truly put Gorsuch’s nomination in jeopardy or whether the president was expressing his frustration aloud, as he often does. But at the time, some in the White House and on Capitol Hill feared that Gorsuch’s confirmation — which had been shaping up to be one of the clearest triumphs of Trump’s tumultuous young presidency — was on the verge of going awry. \n \n Sen.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) \n \n This account is based on interviews with 11 people familiar with the episode, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. \n \n Trump was especially upset by what he viewed as Gorsuch’s insufficient gratitude for a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court, White House officials said. The judge sent the president a handwritten letter dated March 2, thanking him for the nomination and explaining how grateful he was, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. \n \n “Your address to Congress was magnificent,” Gorsuch wrote. “And you were so kind to recognize Mrs. Scalia, remember the justice, and mention me. My teenage daughters were cheering the TV!” \n \n The reference to “the justice” was to Antonin Scalia, the late justice whom Gorsuch replaced, and “Mrs. Scalia” is his widow, Maureen. \n \n Aides said Trump did not immediately receive the note, but it was retrieved by legislative affairs director Marc Short and then viewed by Trump on March 10, helping ease his concerns. \n \n “As head of legislative affairs, our team was in charge of his nomination, and never did I view his nomination in jeopardy, nor did the president ever suggest to me that he wanted to pull him,” Short said. “The process obviously caused frustration, but that frustration was compounded by the fact that Gorsuch had sent him a personal letter that he never received.” \n \n Gorsuch, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment. \n \n President Trump watches as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch hugs his wife, Marie Louise, moments after Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy administered the judicial oath in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 10. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n \n “The president’s nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch was among his first and most important accomplishments during his first year in office, and delivered on a major campaign promise,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement. “At no point did the president consider withdrawing Justice Gorsuch’s nomination. He is very proud of the accomplishment.” \n \n Advisers also told Trump that Gorsuch was trying to demonstrate the independence necessary to make it through the confirmation process and that pulling the nomination would have far-reaching repercussions and might infuriate supporters who were enthusiastic about the conservative jurist. \n \n In April, two months after Trump first expressed his ire, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch on a vote of 54 to 45. Trump and his allies promptly began boasting about the appointment as one of the president’s major achievements. \n \n The incident that so angered Trump came shortly after a federal judge had issued a nationwide stop to the president’s travel ban targeting a list of majority-Muslim countries. At the time, the president disparaged the “so-called judge” on Twitter, writing that the ruling “put our country in such peril.” \n \n “If something happens blame him and court system,” Trump wrote. “People pouring in. Bad!” \n \n Trump had additionally said that a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that held oral arguments to review the judge’s order was “disgraceful” and that the judges cared more about politics than following the law. \n \n Gorsuch, meanwhile, was moving through the confirmation process, doing rounds of courtesy meetings with senators on Capitol Hill — including the one with Blumenthal, which quickly became news after the senator shared their private discussion with reporters. \n \n “I told him how abhorrent Donald Trump’s invective and insults are toward the judiciary,” Blumenthal told The Post in an interview. “And he said to me that he found them ‘disheartening’ and ‘demoralizing’ — his words.” \n \n Ron Bonjean, a member of the group guiding Gorsuch through the confirmation process, confirmed the account at the time. \n \n The remarks angered the president, who attacked Blumenthal on Twitter, saying the senator misrepresented Gorsuch’s comments. But at the time, at least, he also felt that Gorsuch himself was being disloyal. \n \n In a meeting with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Trump attacked the judge in sharp terms, surprising his fellow Republicans. \n \n “He’s probably going to end up being a liberal like the rest of them,” Trump told the Republican leaders, according to a person with knowledge of the comments. “You never know with these guys.” \n \n A senior White House official who was in the room during the meeting disputed that characterization, saying the president is concerned about the judicial outlook of all lifetime nominees. \n \n But McConnell was so concerned that he made a point of repeatedly telling Trump to stay the course on Gorsuch — and that he would make sure the judge made it through the confirmation process with as few hiccups as possible. \n \n “It’s clear [Trump] was very upset with the comment” by Gorsuch, said someone familiar with the incident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. \n \n The person added that he largely faults the White House for failing to adequately prepare Trump for Gorsuch’s comments and to explain that Supreme Court nominees asserting their independence from the president who appointed them was a natural part of a successful confirmation process. \n \n In fact, establishing Gorsuch’s independence from Trump was so important that it was the subject of the first question he was asked by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a fervent Gorsuch supporter. “Tell us whether you’d have any trouble ruling against the president who appointed you,” Grassley said at the time. \n \n “That’s a softball, Mr. Chairman,” Gorsuch replied. “I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and the facts and the particular case require. And I’m heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that there’s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges in this country.” \n \n Despite Trump’s early concerns, Gorsuch’s young tenure has given the president little reason to question his appointment to the Supreme Court. If anything, the justice — who has emerged as one of the court’s most conservative members — has been criticized for not distancing himself enough from both the president and the Republican Senate leaders who championed his nomination through the highly partisan confirmation process. \n \n Gorsuch traveled to Kentucky with McConnell to lecture at the senator’s two alma maters. One of his first public speeches was to a conservative scholarship organization that held its luncheon meeting at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the subject of a lawsuit alleging that payments to Trump’s companies violate the Constitution’s emoluments clause. \n \n Gorsuch also was the featured speaker at the annual black-tie gala of the Federalist Society, which had recommended him to Trump for the Supreme Court, telling the cheering crowd that neither originalism nor textualism “is going anywhere on my watch.” \n \n In April, Trump bragged to the National Rifle Association that Gorsuch “is really something very special” and in June told the Faith and Freedom Coalition that no president had accomplished more in their first 100 days, citing Gorsuch as a key achievement. \n \n “I appointed and confirmed a Supreme Court justice in the mold of the late, great Antonin Scalia,” he said, “and now Justice Gorsuch has a seat on the United States Supreme Court.” \n \n In his March note to Trump, Gorsuch was similarly effusive. \n \n “The team you have assembled to assist me in the Senate is remarkable and inspiring,” he wrote. “I see daily their love of country and our Constitution, and know it is a tribute to you and your leadership for policy is always about personnel.” \n \n He concluded, “Congratulations again on such a great start.”']",2,"– Was the bloom at one point off the Neil Gorsuch rose? When President Trump first tapped the Supreme Court justice for the job earlier this year, he praised Gorsuch as being the ""best"" candidate for the job, and by many accounts, Gorsuch has since made good at carrying out the president's conservative agenda. And Trump has publicly touted Gorsuch as one of his main achievements so far—but privately things may have been quite different initially. Sources tell the Washington Post Trump was furious after hearing Gorsuch was slamming him in private meetings with lawmakers (specifically a February one with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal) in response to the president's attacks on the judiciary. So furious, in fact, that Trump spoke of yanking his nomination of Gorsuch and finding someone else for the job, sources say. ""He's probably going to end up being a liberal like the rest of them,"" Trump reportedly told Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell during a meeting; a source says McConnell had to talk Trump down. Part of what fueled Trump's ""explosion"" was that Gorsuch didn't seem ""loyal"" and appeared ungrateful for the opportunity of a lifetime position on the Supreme Court, other sources note. What appears to have soothed Trump's nerves: a handwritten letter from Gorsuch, dated March 2 and seen by the Post, expressing his gratitude. ""Your address to Congress was magnificent,"" Gorsuch wrote. ""And you were so kind to ... mention me. My teenage daughters were cheering the TV!"" The White House is pushing back on the Post report. ""At no point did the president consider withdrawing Justice Gorsuch's nomination,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""He is very proud of the accomplishment."""
"['“Ah, what a trifle is a heart, \n \n If once into love’s hands it come!” \n \n John Donne, The Broken Heart \n \n That line, and those of thousands of other poems and love songs, may have to be rewritten, according to Professor Alain Carpentier, the inventor of the world’s first fully artificial, self-regulating heart. \n \n His contraption is now beating inside the breast of a 75-year-old Frenchman. Controlled by a computer and made partly from chemically treated animal tissues, it is the culmination of a 30-year quest by Mr Carpentier, 80, for the “holy grail” of transplant surgery. \n \n Asked on Sunday to comment on his discovery, he quoted the celebrated 19th century French scientist Claude Bernard: “Whatever the poets may say, the heart is just a pump.” \n \n Mr Carpentier went on to add, however: “It’s a rather special kind of pump. If your loved one came through the door [and you had a Carpentier artificial heart], it would start to beat faster, just like a real one.” \n \n Other types of artificial heart have been constructed and fitted, with varying degrees of success, such as Robert Jarvik’s device first implanted in 1982. Mr Carpentier’s invention is claimed to be the first to be completely artificial and self-regulating. It was constructed by a French medical engineering company, Carmat, and transplanted into a patient by two surgeons at a Paris hospital in a 10-hour operation last Wednesday. \n \n The operation, leaked to the French press before it was to be officially announced this week, is reported to have gone well. The patient was said to have been “near death, without any other alternative available” but is now responding well. \n \n Mr Carpentier hopes his artificial heart, powered by replaceable batteries carried outside the body, will help to solve the chronic shortage of hearts for transplant surgery. Unlike a real donor heart, it should not provoke rejection by the host. \n \n The Carpentier heart weighs 900g, is roughly the same size as a real heart and imitates its functions exactly. Electrical sensors and microprocessors monitor the demands of the body for blood and adjust the operation of the heart accordingly. \n \n In an interview on Sunday with the Journal du Dimanche, Professor Carpentier said he began his work on artificial hearts three decades ago. “I was confronted with a painful situation,” he said. “I was a doctor with a patient who was about to die from a defective heart when there was no transplant available.” \n \n Mr Carpentier initially developed artificial heart valves made from chemically treated animal tissues. “I then decided to try to create an entire heart with these same materials,” he said. \n \n The cost of a Carpentier artificial heart is estimated at £100,000 to £135,000 – about the same as the overall cost of providing a transplanted heart from an accident victim. The present model is the right size for 70 per cent of men and 25 per cent of women, but Mr Carpentier is developing a smaller version.', 'PARIS (Reuters) - France\'s Carmat said on Friday it had carried out its first implant of an artificial heart that can beat for up to five years, adding that the operation had gone smoothly. \n \n The implant operation was performed on Wednesday at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris, the biomedical firm said in a statement. It said that the male patient was awake and talking and he was being monitored in the intensive care unit. \n \n ""We are delighted with this first implant, although it is premature to draw conclusions given that a single implant has been performed and that we are in the early postoperative phase"", said Carmat\'s CEO, Marcello Conviti. \n \n Heart-assistance devices have been used for decades as a temporary solution for patients awaiting transplants, but Carmat\'s bioprosthetic product is designed to replace the real heart over the long run, mimicking nature\'s work using biological materials and sensors. \n \n It is aimed at helping the thousands of patients who die each year while awaiting a donor, and reducing the side-effects associated with transplants. \n \n ""It\'s about giving patients a normal social life with the least dependence on medication as possible,"" Alain Carpentier, surgeon and Carmat co-founder, told France 2 television. \n \n Carmat estimates around 100,000 patients in the United States and Europe could benefit from its artificial heart, a market worth more than 16 billion euros ($22 billion). \n \n ""We already had devices of this type but they had a relatively low autonomy. This heart will allow for more movement and less clotting. The study that is starting is being very closely watched in the medical field,"" Patrick Nataf, head of heart surgery at Paris Bichat hospital, told BFM TV. \n \n France\'s Health Minister was quick to tout the operation as a sign of the country\'s edge in the field of healthcare. \n \n ""This news brings great pride to France,"" Marisol Touraine told BFM TV. ""It shows we are pioneers in healthcare, that we can invent, that we can carry an innovation that will also bring great hope to plenty of people."" \n \n Among Carmat\'s competitors for artificial heart implants are privately-held SynCardia Systems and Abiomed, both of the United States. \n \n ""We\'re very happy for them and we wish them the best in their pursuit,"" said a spokesman for SynCardia, whose artificial heart is the only one approved both in the United States and the European Union and has been implanted over 1,200 times. \n \n The longest a patient has lived with SynCardia\'s heart is just under four years. \n \n THREE TIMES HEAVIER THAN A HEALTHY HEART \n \n In September, Carmat got the green light from French authorities to test the first human implants of the device on four patients in three hospitals. Earlier this year, it won approval to proceed with human implants in Belgium, Poland, Slovenia and Saudi Arabia. \n \n The Paris patient is the first worldwide to be implanted with the device, Carmat said. The patients selected for the trials suffer from terminal heart failure and the success of the device will be judged on whether they survive with the implant for at least a month. \n \n Conviti told Reuters last month Carmat hoped to finish human trials of the heart by the end of next year and to obtain approval to market them in the EU by early 2015. \n \n The Carmat device, developed by a team of engineers from Airbus parent company EADS, weighs about 900g (around 2 lb)- nearly three times more than an average healthy human heart. It is expected to cost 140,000 to 180,000 euros in Europe. \n \n It mimics heart muscle contractions and contains sensors that adapt the blood flow to the patient\'s moves. \n \n It is powered by external, wearable lithium-ion batteries. Inside the heart, surfaces that come into contact with human blood are made partly from bovine tissue instead of synthetic materials such as plastic that can cause blood clots. \n \n Patients that will be implanted with Carmat\'s devices are more likely to be men. Heart failure affects more men than women and the sheer size of the artificial heart means it can fit in 86 percent of men but only around 20 percent of women. \n \n But Carmat says it could easily manufacture a smaller version to fit the smaller bodies of women as well as patients in India and China. \n \n Carmat\'s shares have risen five-fold since floating on the Paris stock market in 2010, giving the company a market capitalization of about 436 million euros. \n \n ($1 = 0.7315 euros) \n \n (Additional reporting by Mark John; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Rosalind Russell)']",2,"– Alain Carpentier thinks he has an answer to chronic shortages of organ donors. The French cardiac surgeon—under Carmat, the French company he founded—has invented what the Independent calls the ""world's first fully artificial, self-regulating heart,"" and it apparently works, at least very initially. Carpentier's creation was successfully transplanted into a 75-year-old on Wednesday; he's said to be responding favorably. If you're wondering why it deserves the label ""first,"" especially considering Robert Jarvik's artificial heart was first implanted in 1982, Carpentier, 80, explains that his is the first heart to self-regulate, mimicking an actual heart. ""If your loved one came through the door [and you had a Carpentier artificial heart], it would start to beat faster, just like a real one,"" he says. Further, surfaces that are exposed to human blood are made in part from cow tissue, rather than synthetic material, which can produce blood clots and therefore require the use of anticoagulants; its design also minimizes the chance of rejection, reports the Financial Times. Most importantly, it's designed to sidestep the need for a donor heart: Reuters reports the current model, powered by external lithium batteries, is expected to keep a patient alive for up to five years. The heart was three decades in the making, and the end result is similar in size to a real heart, though it weighs three times more (at nearly 2 pounds) and isn't sized correctly for all—about 86% of men but only 20% of women, reports Reuters (a smaller model is planned). The expected cost is $190,000 to $220,000, on par with the cost of a traditional heart transplant. The Carmat heart has been approved for testing in three more French patients; the initial trial seeks to determine whether the patients can survive at least one month.

"['Drama. Starring Matt Damon and Cecile De France. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (PG-13. 129 minutes. In English and in French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) \n \n That Clint Eastwood has become a great filmmaker is something few would contest, yet the nature of his greatness is as surprising as it\'s little understood. You can talk about the pristine technique - the new film, ""Hereafter,"" provides lots of examples. But what\'s much more fascinating and enriching is Eastwood\'s Olympian vision, the sympathetic and all-encompassing understanding of the pain and grandeur of life on earth. \n \n This vision is consistent in Eastwood\'s late work, no matter who is doing the screenwriting, and it boggles the mind to realize that this is coming from a guy who, until he was about 60, was best known as an action hero. Make no mistake, Eastwood\'s directorial output, from ""Mystic River"" on, constitutes the 21st century\'s first cinematic marvel, and ""Hereafter"" is among the best things he has ever done. \n \n Like Alejandro Inarritu\'s ""Babel"" and Wayne Kramer\'s ""Crossing Over,"" ""Hereafter"" is an attempt to convey the bigness of life though a story involving disparate characters in different parts of the world. All three movies are responses to the interconnectedness of the world, but ""Hereafter"" is by far the most successful, partly because it has the best screenplay - by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") - and partly because it has a director who understands the difference between important and self-important. \n \n Importance is earned, shot by shot, scene by scene. Self-importance is assumed, and is largely a matter of adopting an attitude and keeping a straight face. \n \n Eastwood takes us into the story from the opening shots. From a hotel, we see a beach resort, filmed with the kind of color saturation we might see in an old postcard. The effect is reassuring, but misleading. A vacationing French journalist (Cecile De France) goes into the village to buy presents. And suddenly, there\'s a rumbling, the sight of a rising wave, and within seconds, buildings are washed away, and cars, trucks and people are all caught in a rushing flood. \n \n There have been tidal waves in movies before, but what makes this one so effective (aside from being perfectly realized on the technical end) is that Eastwood stays with De France. He doesn\'t show us an overview, so that we might get our bearings. Rather, we experience the catastrophe from one person\'s terrified and completely subjective vantage point. It\'s as close as you\'ll ever be to a tidal wave without getting wet. \n \n ""Hereafter"" features three central characters that have been touched by death. The newswoman drowns and is revived. A construction worker (Matt Damon) in San Francisco is cursed with an ability to talk to the dead. (If he touches someone, he finds himself in communication with that person\'s dead relatives - so much for his love life.) And a little boy in London develops an all-consuming desire to talk to a recently deceased loved one. These stories play out separately, then gradually move toward one another. \n \n Notice how every shot communicates something precise, whether it\'s plot detail or a thought or emotion. As an actor, Eastwood is used to breaking up a script into a succession of specific actions, and he does the same as a director. Such meticulousness serves his actors well and allows Eastwood to take his time within scenes and let them expand and feel lived in. He never wastes his audience\'s time, because he is always feeding it new information. \n \n Eastwood\'s practical unwillingness to neglect any actor ends up giving ""Hereafter"" a humane essence: Everybody is important, not just Damon as the tortured psychic or De France as a breezy extrovert deepened by trauma. Thus, the little boy\'s mother (Lyndsey Marshal), is more than a desperate alcoholic, and Bryce Dallas Howard gets to create a rich character as Melanie, the psychic\'s partner in a San Francisco cooking class - a young woman masking pain under a superficial facade that has become her personality. \n \n The ironic result of all this meticulous care is that we don\'t see Eastwood\'s hand but rather have the illusion that this gallery of humanity is telling the story for him. It\'s the most self-effacing way to do great work, and it\'s an approach that couldn\'t be more suited to this material. The film\'s notion that people share a common destiny, that they\'re participating in some overarching order, that they\'re being watched over by a benevolent all-seeing understanding, doesn\'t need to be spelled out. It has its analogue and expression in Eastwood\'s technique. \n \n He just tells the story, and we get it. \n \n -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations. \n \n This article appeared on page E - 1 of the San Francisco Chronicle', 'Hereafter \n \n October 19, 2010 \n \n Clint Eastwood\'s ""Hereafter"" considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling. I don\'t believe in woo-woo, but then neither, I suspect, does Eastwood. This is a film about the afterlife that carefully avoids committing itself on such a possibility. The closest it comes is the idea of consciousness after apparent death. This is plausible. Many near-death survivors report the same memories, of the white light, the waiting figures and a feeling of peace. \n \n One of the characters seems to have a genuine psychic gift. But is he in fact communicating with people beyond the grave? Some form of telepathy might be possible, and he may simply be receiving what his subjects desire or need to be told by their dead loved ones. He brings nothing from beyond the grave that his clients could not have formed in their living minds. \n \n \n \n This is a subject that lends itself to sensation and psychic baloney. It\'s astonishing how many people believe New Age notions, which have the attraction of allowing believers to confer supernormal abilities on themselves and others without the bother of plausibility. Eastwood\'s film will leave such people vaguely uneasy. It believes most psychics are frauds. It supposes one who seems to be the real thing, but what, exactly, is he real about? \n \n \n \n This is a film for intelligent people who are naturally curious about what happens when the shutters close. Eastwood tells three primary stories. The stories meet at the end, in one of those coincidences so beloved by multiple-strand movies. Is this possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. A coincidence never is. That\'s why we notice them. Throughout the film, the characters behave in ways that seem reasonable enough, and possibilities are left open, which is as it should be. We must live the lives we know and not count on anything beyond the horizon. \n \n \n \n ""Hereafter"" stars Matt Damon as George, a man who sincerely believes he\'s able to have communication with the dead, but has fled that ability and taken a low-profile job; Cecile de France as Marie, a newsreader on French television; Bryce Dallas Howard as Melanie, a young cooking student with a fearful dark place inside; Richard Kind as a man mourning his wife; and Frankie and George McLaren as twin brothers, one of whom is struck by a truck and killed. \n \n \n \n I won\'t describe here the traumatic surprises some of them experience. In the surprises as in everything else, ""Hereafter"" is believable. There are terrifying events, but Eastwood handles them not for sensation but to show how close we all are, at any moment, to oblivion. In the case of Marie, she undergoes the near death experience we often hear reported, with the white light and the figures. Are people in such a state already dead, or are they experiencing visions generated by the human mind in its final shutdown mode? \n \n \n \n The powers of the Damon character seem to be authentic, although what they prove is hard to say. There is a moment handled with love and delicacy in which he says something that is either true or isn\'t, but is a kindness either way. When he holds a stranger\'s hands he experiences a flash of telepathic insight, but the movie never declares that his insights literally come from dead spirits. \n \n \n \n Eastwood and his actors achieve a tone that doesn\'t force the material but embraces it: Not dreamlike, but evoking a reverie state. These characters are not hurtling toward the resolution of a plot. There is no ""solution"" to their stories. There are various degrees of solace, or not. They don\'t punch the dialogue. They lack the certainty to impose themselves. George in particular is reserved and sad, because his power has become a burden to him. \n \n \n \n There\'s a sweet subplot involving Melanie (Howard), who he meets as a partner in a cooking class. She has experienced loss. George doesn\'t want to enter her mind. He yearns for a normal life. The ability to read minds would be an unbearable curse. The way his gift affects their relationship is stark and poignant. Marie, the newsreader, is played by Cecile de France in such a fresh and likable way that our sympathy is engaged and we understand that whatever happened to her in the first terrifying scene has fundamentally changed her. Frankie McLaren, as the solemn and earnest little boy seeking his dead twin, takes a character that could have been bathetic and makes him simple and transparent. And notice Richard Kind, so affecting as a man who has lost his wife. \n \n \n \n The movie is an original screenplay by Peter Morgan (""The Queen""). Eastwood told me Morgan doesn\'t believe in an afterlife. I don\'t know if Eastwood does, either. His film embodies how love makes us need for there to be an afterlife. It is the film of a man at peace. He has nothing to prove except his care for the living. \n \n \n \n Incorporates a little wording from my blog entry from the Toronto film festival premiere.', 'Across the Styx, but never out on a limb \n \n By Michael O\'Sullivan \n \n Friday, October 22, 2010 \n \n For much of its two-hour-plus length, ""Hereafter"" plays like a smart and stylish thriller. Smart because of the way it pulls back, but only a little bit, from a full-on embrace of its central premise: the existence of an afterlife for the human soul. Stylish because of its cool and bloodless demeanor. The world it depicts - our world, the world of the here and now - is bathed in a deathlike pallor of icy blues and grays, whether set in San Francisco, London or Paris. \n \n It\'s a thriller because of the pervasive tone of dread and sadness. For its three main characters, the world is a deeply haunted place indeed. \n \n At the center of the mostly mesmerizing but finally flawed film is George Lonegan (Matt Damon). In the script by two-time Oscar nominee Peter Morgan (""The Queen"" and ""Frost/Nixon""), which has been directed with admirable restraint by Clint Eastwood, George is a former professional psychic who has shut down his lucrative Bay Area practice to work as a menial laborer. It seems that his ability to talk to the dead through readings is less the gift one might think than a curse. \n \n All George has to do is to touch someone\'s hand and he\'s plugged into a parallel universe - a universe of actual ghosts and the ghosts of repressed trauma. These days, despite his best efforts, he\'s forever running away from skeletons: both the kind in the ground and the kind in someone else\'s closet. \n \n Needless to say, this makes it kind of hard for George to maintain relationships. The first time he takes a woman\'s hand, as he does on an abortive first date with a flirtatious cutie from cooking class (Bryce Dallas Howard), he immediately knows everything about her. And I mean everything. So much for leaving something to the imagination. \n \n But Eastwood\'s film isn\'t just about George\'s romantic problems. Woven into that narrative are two even more compelling story lines. \n \n While on a vacation, French TV anchor Marie LeLay (Cecile de France) almost drowns, during what we\'re led to believe is the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. This is the scene that opens the film, and it\'s a doozy of harrowingly real special-effects. Brought back from the brink of death, Marie soon quits her job to research and write a book on near-death experiences. (The name of the manuscript, ""Hereafter,"" lends the film its title.) \n \n Meanwhile, in London, a taciturn schoolboy named Marcus (Frankie McLaren) is traumatized when his identical twin, Jason, (George McLaren) is accidentally killed. Marcus spends the rest of the movie trying to contact his dead brother, or to track down somebody who can. At one point, Jason seems to reach from beyond the grave to save Marcus from one of the London subway bombings of 2005, by knocking Marcus\'s hat off his head. \n \n It\'s these dramatic close calls - first the tsunami, then the bombing - that lend the film an air of mounting suspense. Eastwood and Morgan handle them with as little cheesiness as possible, under the circumstances. The tone is not one of skepticism, so much as deadpan acceptance of things we may not understand. \n \n As the film proceeds, however, something terrible (or perhaps something wonderful) seems to be brewing, something even more dramatic than what\'s come before. Something that somehow involves not only George, and his ability to connect with the other side, but also Marie and Marcus. It takes the film nearly two hours to get there, but finally, near the end of the movie, all three characters wind up in London, for what we\'ve been led to believe will be a collision - or at least a fusion - of artfully woven plotlines. \n \n That fusion never takes place. \n \n Not, at least, in the way that Eastwood and Morgan have been hinting at in ""Hereafter\'s"" deliciously creepy, otherworldly build-up. George and Marcus do meet. So do George and Marie. The film is filled with such great little one-on-one scenes. And the best of them are between the living, not between the living and the dead. \n \n But the big payoff fizzles. By pulling its punches, by refusing to make outlandish claims about a world beyond this one, ""Hereafter"" avoids the pitfalls of other supernatural thrillers. But it\'s unable to avoid the even soggier conventions of the movie romance. \n \n It starts out with a tsunami - and ends up standing in a puddle. \n \n Contains disturbing disaster and accident scenes, brief crude language and drug and alcohol abuse. In English and some French with English subtitles.']",3,"– Clint Eastwood, Matt Damon … what’s not to like about Hereafter? But not all the critics are overly impressed with this spiritual film that touches on the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 London subway bombings: “The mostly mesmerizing but finally flawed film” mostly “plays like a smart and stylish thriller,” writes Michael O'Sullivan in the Washington Post. But the promise of three separate and “artfully-woven” plotlines coming together for “a collision—or at least a fusion,” is never realized. “The big payoff fizzles.” Mick LaSalle begs to differ: This is one of Eastwood’s best, he writes in the San Francisco Chronicle. “Every shot communicates something precise, whether it's plot detail or a thought or emotion.” The result is a “sympathetic and all-encompassing understanding of the pain and grandeur of life on earth.” In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert concurs: The “enthralling” film “considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact.” Though the subject matter “lends itself to sensation and psychic baloney … this is a film for intelligent people who are naturally curious about what happens when the shutters close.” Another in the thumb's down camp: It tackles big topics ""without having anything to say,” writes Kyle Smith in the New York Post. “The movie drags, yet it feels like it's missing an hour. It features three characters on three continents who barely interact with one another. And after 130 minutes, it stops without concluding.” Eastwood recently promoted the film, but ended up talking about his disagreements with President Obama. Watch that interview here."

A bipartisan group of senators — including Arizona Republicans McCain and Jeff Flake — want assurances on border security as Congress weighs what could be the biggest changes to immigration law in nearly 30 years. Arizona is the only state with both of its senators working on immigration reform in Congress, a sign of the state’s widely debated border security issues. \n \n Immigration activists and elected officials say it’s only natural for Arizona to continue to take the forefront in the national conversation on immigration after years of internal debate on how to handle scores of immigrants. \n \n “No state in this country has had more experience with enforcement-only immigration laws than Arizona,” said Todd Landfried, executive director of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform, which opposes the state’s tough immigration laws. \n \n During a heated town hall gathering in the Phoenix suburb of Sun Lakes, McCain said the border near Yuma is largely secure, but said smugglers are using the border near Tucson to pump drugs into Phoenix. He said immigration reform should be contingent on better border security that must rely largely on technology able to detect border crossings. \n \n He said a tamper-proof Social Security card would help combat identity fraud, and noted any path to citizenship must require immigrants to learn English, cover back taxes and pay fines for breaking immigration laws. \n \n “There are 11 million people living here illegally,” McCain said. “We are not going to get enough buses to deport them.” \n \n Some audience members shouted out their disapproval. \n \n One man yelled that only guns would discourage illegal immigration. Another man complained that illegal immigrants should never be able to become citizens or vote. A third man said illegal immigrants were illiterate invaders who wanted free government benefits. \n \n McCain urged compassion. “We are a Judeo-Christian nation,” he said. McCain’s other town hall meeting took place in Green Valley, south of Tucson. \n \n Arizona gained international recognition as an epicenter of the U.S. immigration debate when it passed its tough anti-immigrant law in 2010. A handful of other states — including Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah — have since adopted variations of Arizona’s law. \n \n Arizona has the nation’s eighth-highest population of illegal immigrants, according to the Pew Research Hispanic Center. In 2010, illegal immigrants represented roughly 6 percent of the state’s population. \n \n Activists said Arizona’s anti-immigrant laws inspired many illegal immigrants to demand more rights. Last week, some college students rallied outside Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer’s office for driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants. \n \n “They no longer are afraid to come and say, ‘I am not able to vote, but I can make my voice heard, and they have to listen to me,’” said community organizer Abril Gallardo. \n \n A report released in January showed the U.S. Border Patrol’s Tucson sector remains the busiest along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Tucson sector accounted for 38 percent of all drug seizures and 37 percent of all apprehensions along the border. \n \n Brewer said last week the border cannot be declared safe until the people living near it feel secure from drug human trafficking. \n \n But Democratic Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona told Latino and black community leaders at a Phoenix luncheon Tuesday that Arizonans need to spread the word on how much more secure the border has become. \n \n “There are lots of folks who don’t live in Arizona who have no idea what the border is like,” Sinema said. \n \n Napolitano toured the border Tuesday afternoon with U.S. Customs and Border Protection Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar, Democratic Rep. Ron Barber of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware.

A handful of other states _ including Alabama, Indiana, Georgia, South Carolina and Utah _ have since adopted variations of Arizona\'s law. \n \n ""No state in this country has had more experience with enforcement-only immigration laws than Arizona,"" said Todd Landfried, executive director of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform, which opposes the state\'s tough immigration laws. \n \n During a heated town hall gathering in the Phoenix suburb of Sun Lakes, McCain said the border near Yuma is largely secure, but said smugglers are using the border near Tucson to pump drugs into Phoenix. He said immigration reform should be contingent on better border security that must rely largely on technology able to detect border crossings. \n \n McCain said a tamper-proof Social Security card would help combat identity fraud, and noted any path to citizenship must require immigrants to learn English, cover back taxes and pay fines for breaking immigration laws. \n \n ""There are 11 million people living here illegally,"" he said. ""We are not going to get enough buses to deport them."" \n \n Some audience members shouted out their disapproval. \n \n One man yelled that only guns would discourage illegal immigration. Another man complained that illegal immigrants should never be able to become citizens or vote. A third man said illegal immigrants were illiterate invaders who wanted free government benefits. \n \n McCain urged compassion. ""We are a Judeo-Christian nation,"" he said. McCain\'s other town hall meeting took place in Green Valley, south of Tucson. \n \n Arizona has the nation\'s eighth-highest population of illegal immigrants, according to the Pew Research Hispanic Center. In 2010, illegal immigrants represented roughly 6 percent of the state\'s population. \n \n Activists said Arizona\'s anti-immigrant laws inspired many illegal immigrants to demand more rights. Last week, some college students rallied outside Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer\'s office for driver\'s licenses for illegal immigrants. \n \n ""They no longer are afraid to come and say, `I am not able to vote, but I can make my voice heard, and they have to listen to me,\'"" said community organizer Abril Gallardo. \n \n A report released in January showed the U.S. Border Patrol\'s Tucson sector remains the busiest along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Tucson sector accounted for 38 percent of all drug seizures and 37 percent of all apprehensions along the border. \n \n Brewer said last week the border cannot be declared safe until the people living near it feel secure from drug and human trafficking. \n \n But Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona told Latino and black community leaders at a Phoenix luncheon Tuesday that Arizonans need to spread the word on how much more secure the border has become. \n \n ""There are lots of folks who don\'t live in Arizona who have no idea what the border is like,"" Sinema said. \n \n Napolitano toured the border Tuesday afternoon with U.S. Customs and Border Protection Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar, Democratic Rep. Ron Barber of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware. Carper is the incoming chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. \n \n She said in a statement after the tour that border crossings are down 50 percent since 2008 and 78 percent since their peak in 2000. \n \n ___ \n \n Cristina Silva can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/cristymsilva.']",2,"– John McCain took a lot of heat at a pair of town hall meetings yesterday over his new push for immigration reform, with many angry Arizona residents telling him in turn that illegal immigrants should never become citizens, the AP reports. ""Cut off their welfare and their stuff and they'll go back,"" said one man, in a particularly heated exchange caught on camera by AZCentral. He then threw McCain's 2010 campaign ad back in his face: ""You said, 'Build the dang fence. Where's the fence?"" McCain replied by citing the money that had been spent to curb illegal immigration, and the progress that had been made. ""There are 11 million people living here illegally,"" he said. ""We are not going to get enough buses to deport them."""

"[""Russian President Vladimir Putin has just imposed harsh new security measures around the resort town of Sochi, home to the 2014 Winter Olympics Games. The measures, which went largely unnoticed outside of Russia, may be the most extreme ever placed on an Olympic city. But as Putin attempts to present an image of stability, progress and prosperity to the rest of the world, his enemies are now accusing him of planning a gulag-style restricted area in and around Sochi. \n \n Our web monitoring of Russian-language internet traffic revealed that the accusers are anti-Russian Islamic insurgents in the North Caucasus, a restive region not far from Sochi. The rebels, who have a bloody history of terror attacks, have long made clear their intentions to target the Olympics. \n \n unprecedented compared to what? Since the mid-1980s, the Olympics have always been held in democratic countries--save for the 2008 Olympics in China. Those Olympics were previously the most extreme in their implementation of population control and security measures. Our research shows that the Sochi measures will be even more intense. \n \n The Kavkaz Center, a rebel news outlet, is now decrying the presidential decree that Putin signed on Monday, which will institute the stringent new security measures in Sochi beginning Jan. 7 and going until March 21, 2014. It creates a restricted zone of up to 80 miles around the city, and blocks road entry into the area for everyone except registered residents, emergency vehicles, railway passengers and those traveling with special government permission. That leaves train and air travel as the only viable modes of transport, which will allow the security services to strictly scrutinize the belongings and identities of incoming travelers. Since the Olympics take place between Feb. 7 and Feb. 23, that means the city will be on virtual lockdown for months simply for the sake of a two week sporting event. \n \n how we know We continually monitor postings from Kavkaz Center. While the site clearly supports terrorist groups such as the Caucasus Emirate, they often present correct facts, but add in commentary clearly slanted toward sympathy for jihadi causes. Their calling the security situation around Sochi unprecedented-though hyped up to win a propaganda victory against Russia-is actually a valid point. \n \n As part of the new measures, Putin also banned public protests and marches unrelated to the Olympics within the area. So protesting about gay rights certainly seems out of the question. Athletes won’t even be allowed to paint their fingernails in solidarity with their gay and lesbian counterparts. The Sochi protest prohibition comes on the heels of a country-wide law, passed last summer, that introduced fines of up to $10,000 or two years in prison for participating in a spontaneous demonstration. The alternative, applying for permission to assemble, can be rejected for any reason by the government. \n \n Who Runs Kavkaz Center? The site was created by Movladi Udugov, the Deputy Prime Minister and head propagandist for the former Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Currently, he uses the site as part of information campaign to support the Caucasus Emirate and other pan-Islamic jihadi causes. \n \n The Kavkaz Center’s accusation that Putin is tightening a Stalin-like grip on Sochi (where Stalin famously had a dacha, or vacation home) is sure to stir the pot among the Islamic insurgency’s followers. The Center is considered an influential information source among Islamists, and we used specialized software to examine who follows its social media pages. Besides 8,000 Twitter followers, they have Facebook followers ranging from young women in Macedonia and Austria to men from France and the Republic of Georgia. \n \n To dig deeper about public opinion, we used specialized software to analyze Russian social media posts following the announcement of the restricted zone in Sochi. Here are some results: \n \n Доку Умаров пообещал аллахакбар в 2014 в Сочи. Если что-то взорвут – через год население С. Кавказа будет состоять лишь из российских солдат — Степан Грозный (@faraday_m) August 20, 2013 \n \n “Doku Umarov promised an Allahuakbar in 2014 in Sochi. If they blow something up—in a year the population of the North Caucasus will consist only of Russian soldiers.” \n \n Doku Umarov is the leader of the Caucasus Emirate terrorist group, which has threatened to attack the Games. \n \n Another social media user posts a link to an article about the vast security apparatus that Putin is employing. \n \n 40 тысяч полицейских будут обеспечивать безопасность на зимней Олимпиаде 2014 в Сочи http://t.co/bTrhekhNf7 — Новости Ставрополья (@bzfrmt_stav) August 20, 2013 \n \n “40 thousand policemen will provide security for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.” \n \n That number is staggering when you consider that during the 2012 London Olympics, the British deployed only 20,000 soldiers and policemen, and the event was located in a much larger city. \n \n While some worry about Olympic terror attacks, the Russian propaganda machine keeps churning out positivity both on Facebook and its Russian equivalent, VKontakte. \n \n Expect nothing less You'll only hear positive news about Sochi coming from official Russian sources, who will continue to paint a rosy picture despite a myriad of shocking abuses that Vocativ has reported on. The international reputation of the Russian government, as well as President Putin's personal prestige, depends on the Games going off without a hitch. \n \n Using the official kids’ outreach Facebook page, “Mascots of the Olympic Games Sochi 2014,” the government published the cuddly image below. \n \n The description explains that the Olympic mascots are the best company for travel to the mountains. Although the new restrictions make this happy, stuffed-animal friendly scenario unlikely. \n \n The official VKontakte page, “Sochi Games 2014,” published the following image. \n \n From the above post, which says “200 days until the Paralympics in Sochi,” it seems that the Russian government is already getting amped about the next event in the sub-tropical city. (The Paralympics will take place in Sochi in March.) Paradise, it seems, can only be preserved by barbed wire."", 'Putin has spent $2 billion to keep the Winter Games safe from terrorist attacks like those in Volgograd last month. But even if Sochi is safe, Russia may not be. \n \n Why the new health-care bill may keep affordable care out of reach for some \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin takes part in a friendly hockey match at The Bolshoy Ice Dome in Sochi, Russia, on Saturday. With the Olympics Games just a month away, Mr. Putin faces a difficult balancing act of both improving his international reputation and cracking down on terrorism after last month\'s bombings in Volgograd. \n \n With just one month to go before the Sochi Olympics open, Russia is launching the biggest security operation in Olympic history in a tense and largely secret effort to thwart an invisible enemy who has sworn to do everything possible to blight the prestigious international event with acts of mass terror. \n \n President Vladimir Putin traveled to Sochi last week to inspect the Olympic venue\'s $2 billion ""ring of steel"" defenses, which are to go into full operation tomorrow, exactly a month before the Games begin. Earlier he visited Volgograd, where two suicide bombings killed 34 people just before the New Year, and pledged additional measures to fight the terrorists until their ""complete annihilation."" \n \n He has won some support from the international community. In recent days announcements by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and British Prime Minister David Cameron have promised unspecified but deeper and more effective security cooperation with Russia in the run-up to the Olympics. ""We both want the Sochi Games to be a safe and secure Games,"" Mr. Cameron told journalists after a telephone conversation with Mr. Putin last Friday. \n \n Sochi\'s ""ring of steel"" is a zone about 60 miles long and 25 miles deep, in which the local population and visitors will be subjected to near total surveillance. The measures, according to security expert Mark Galeotti, include a garrison of about 25,000 special police, 8,000 interior troops, unknown numbers of plainclothes agents, special forces such as the ""Alpha"" anti-terrorist squad of the FSB (the successor to the KGB), and up to 30,000 regular troops to patrol the nearby borders with Georgia and the breakaway Georgian republic of Abkhazia. The skies will be full of Russian Air Force fighters and at least a dozen drones; ultra-modern S-400 and Pantsir-S anti-aircraft missiles capable of taking down any airborne threat will be deployed around the zone; and four of the Russian Navy\'s new Grachonok anti-saboteur patrol boats with teams of divers and special sonar equipment will range up and down the coast. \n \n Putin\'s gamble \n \n The stakes are high for Putin, who has invested Russia\'s prestige and $51 billion of mostly state cash in hosting the Winter Olympics. \n \n ""Putin\'s personal image is closely connected to the outcome of these Games. So I am absolutely sure that whatever can be done, will be done,"" says Gennady Gudkov, a former KGB security expert and ex-Duma deputy. \n \n It\'s not only Putin\'s international reputation that hangs in the balance. His domestic popularity rests largely on his image as a tough and uncompromising slayer of terrorists. \n \n He arrived in power in autumn 1999 amid a wave of deadly apartment bombings that killed hundreds, and used the public panic over the acts to launch a fresh war against Chechen militants, re-impose strong central government, and greatly beef up Russian security services. Since then, as both president and prime minister, Putin has faced intermittent waves of terrorism which he has often turned to his own advantage. For example, he seized upon the horrific 2004 school siege at Beslan to abolish local elections and further ratchet up the powers of security forces. \n \n But a long lull in serious terrorist attacks against Russia\'s heartland has been shattered by the Volgograd bombings, and in the nail-biting tensions of the coming weeks and months, Russians will be expecting him to ensure their security. \n \n ""This is Putin\'s basic promise to Russians, that he will make us safe,"" says Andrei Piontkovsky, a veteran Kremlin critic. \n \n ""If we look back over the past 15 years, we can see that he never really kept that pledge. We\'ve been hit over and over again,"" he says. ""But because of the Olympics, the whole world is watching. It may be that the extraordinary concentration of security resources in Sochi means that city is safe, but what about the rest of the country? Even Moscow? If terrorists strike anywhere, it will seriously undermine faith in Putin."" \n \n Finding balance \n \n Putin has taken several steps to restore world confidence in the Sochi Olympics, especially after President Barack Obama decided last month that neither he nor any other top US official would be attending the Games. Late last month, the Kremlin amnestied thousands of prisoners, including many of those regarded as ""political"" in the West. In Sochi last week, he relaxed a ban on all protests at the Games and designated a special area where demonstrations may be held with official permission. \n \n But keeping the Olympics safe – and without suffocating them in omnipresent security measures – is his greatest challenge, say experts. \n \n ""One of the purposes of terrorists is to sow uncertainty, ill temper, and chaos,"" says Alexei Makarkin, deputy director of the independent Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. \n \n ""The other side of that coin is the excessive tightening of security measures. This can pose big problems for athletes and spectators. How to secure the Games without creating onerous difficulties for fans – to make the event controllable and calm at the same time – is the biggest issue here. If the balance tips either way, the Games risk being a failure,"" he says. \n \n Unseen dangers? \n \n Some experts warn that in Russia, where a seething North Caucasus Islamic insurgency has been marked by shifting allegiances, and security services have been accused of murky dealings with terrorist networks, there may be unseen dangers ahead. \n \n Most reports focus on Chechen Islamist warlord Doku Umarov, who is presumably holed up somewhere in the rugged Caucasus Mountains, as the main threat. But Nikolai Petrov, a leading expert on Russia\'s regional politics and a professor at Moscow\'s Higher School of Economics, suggests that other forces, including members of pro-Moscow Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov\'s retinue and rogue elements of Russia\'s own security services, may have a strong interest in aiding and abetting more acts of terrorism. \n \n ""When we examine these recent Volgograd attacks, it\'s hard not to notice how well planned and well organized they were. They seem to have enjoyed a lot of logistical help,"" he says. ""Kadyrov may have pacified Chechnya, but his funding from Moscow has been falling lately, and he may not expect to be given such a free hand in Chechnya after the Olympics are over. Some officials in the security forces have interests in private companies that provide security for airports and other transport infrastructure, and there are huge profits to be made in this field."" \n \n ""Terrorism has become a big business, and there are people with a real, material interest in keeping it going,"" Mr. Petrov adds. ""I know how strange this may sound. But we have seen such things before in Russia, and nothing should be taken for granted here.""']",2,"– An ominous new report on Vocativ says the Sochi Olympics may be the most extreme, security-wise, in the history of the Games—the site describes ""a gulag-style restricted area"" instituted by Vladimir Putin. The Christian Science Monitor calls the restricted zone the ""ring of steel,"" an area 60 miles wide and 25 miles deep that will be patrolled by tens of thousands of security troops and in which everyone ""will be subjected to near total surveillance."" Air Force fighters, drones, anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-saboteur patrol boats will be deployed. Travel in and out of the city will be restricted; public protests and marches will be banned. But the most ominous part: According to the Monitor, some worry that even these measures may not be enough. The biggest potential threat appears to be the North Caucasus Islamic insurgency and Chechen Islamist warlord Doku Umarov, leader of the Caucasus Emirate terrorist group, who has promised an attack at the Games. But there are others, experts warn, who are similarly interested in terrorizing Sochi. ""When we examine these recent Volgograd attacks, it's hard not to notice how well planned and well organized they were. They seem to have enjoyed a lot of logistical help,"" says one expert. ""Terrorism has become a big business, and there are people with a real, material interest in keeping it going."" A rebel news outlet has been decrying Putin's security measures, Vocativ reports, noting that the lockdown starts today—a month before the Games start—and lasts until March 21, nearly a month after they end."

"['James Cook University scientists have helped invent a clever technique to tell black leopards apart - a trick that may end up saving their skins. \n \n Scientists from JCU in Australia and others have been studying the leopards on the Malay Peninsula - where almost all of the big cats are jet black. \n \n Experts have no idea why the leopards are black and, until recently, could not tell them apart, hindering research and conservation efforts. \n \n But researchers have now devised a simple method to solve the problem by manipulating the mechanism of automatic cameras. \n \n ""Most automatic cameras have an infrared flash, but it\'s only activated at night"", said Dr Gopalasamy Reuben Clements from JCU. ""However, by blocking the camera\'s light sensor, we can fool the camera into thinking it\'s night even during the day, so it always flashes."" \n \n With the infrared flash firing, the seemingly black leopards suddenly showed complex patterns of spotting. These spots could be used to distinguish different animals, and help estimate the population size of the species. \n \n The researchers tested this method in the north east of Peninsular Malaysia. ""We found we could accurately identify 94% of the animals,"" said Dr Clements, who also works with a local research institute from Universiti Malaysia Terengganu. ""This will allow us to study and monitor this population over time, which is critical for its conservation."" \n \n The researchers want to use their new method to study black leopards in other parts of Peninsular Malaysia where there is abundant prey but few leopards to be seen. It\'s thought widespread poaching is to blame. \n \n ""Many dead leopards bearing injuries inflicted by wire snares have been discovered in Malaysia,"" said Distinguished Professor William Laurance from James Cook University. He said that leopard skins and body parts are increasingly showing up in wildlife trading markets in places such as on the Myanmar-China border. \n \n At the same time, suitable leopard habitats are disappearing faster in Malaysia than perhaps anywhere else in the world, as forests are felled for timber and replaced with oil palm and rubber plantations. \n \n ""Understanding how leopards are faring in an increasingly human-dominated world is vital,"" said Laurie Hedges from the University of Nottingham - Malaysia, lead author of a study on the cats just published in Journal of Wildlife Management. ""This new approach gives us a novel tool to help save this unique and endangered animal."" \n \n Leopards, found from the frozen forests of Russia to the scorching sands of the Kalahari Desert, are the most widely distributed large cat on earth. Their iconic spotted coat has been admired and coveted by humans for millennia. \n \n The black leopards of Peninsular Malaysia are extremely rare. ""This is perhaps the only known example of a wild mammal with virtually an entire population composed of black individuals,"" said Laurie Hedges. \n \n Black coloration--also known as \'melanism\'--is found in some mammal species, especially big cats, where individuals that normally have patterns or colours in their coat are instead completely black. However, scientists have no idea why it predominates in the Malay Peninsula. \n \n ###', 'Black leopard near road in the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor. Photo by: William Yap. \n \n The black panther has a mythical aura: Rudyard Kipling chose the animal for one of his heroes in, in the 1970s it became the symbol of an African-American socialist party, while comic guru Stan Lee selected the stunning feline for his first black superhero. But the real black panther isn\'t an actual species, instead it\'s a rare dark pigmentation found most commonly in leopards, but also occasionally in jaguars and other wild cats. The rarity of the black panther—not to mention its striking appearance—has added to their mystery. However, recent studies have found that black panthers, in this case \'black leopards,\' are astoundingly common in one part of the world: the Malayan peninsula.""In the same way a genetic mutation can cause some individuals within a species to display albino characteristics, black panthers are simply individuals that have a genotype causing a uniformly black coloration on their coat,"" Laurie Hedges, a carnivore researcher working with the non-profit research group Rimba , told mongabay.com in a recent interview. ""In total 13 species of wild felids have been documented with \'melanistic\' or black forms, but apart from the difference in coloration, they are still the same species as their patterned counter parts.""Rimba, which means \'jungle\' in Malay, is currently conducing camera trapping in two wildlife corridors in Malaysia: the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor and the Bintang Hijau Wildlife Corridors. The camera trapping research, headed by Rimba\'s co-founder Gopalasamy Reuben Clements, has so far taken some astounding images and even video of the black leopard (see below). Here, black leopards are actually the dominant form of leopard. A complete reversal from what occurs across the rest of the leopard\'s massive range.""The Malay Peninsula is entirely unique—nowhere else in the world do melanistic individuals constitute almost the entire leopard population,"" says Hedges, who points to a 2010 study by Kawanishi et al in the Journal of Zoology which, ""revealed that while leopards north of the Isthmus of kra between the Thai and Malay peninsula are mainly spotted, almost all records of leopards south of this famous ecological transition zone are melanistic.""No one is entirely sure why this is the case, however it may be a combination of natural selection—i.e. black leopards survive better in this forest due to their type of camouflage—and genetics within the local population simply straying over time toward melanistic individuals.Clements and his team are putting together a proposal to work with infrared camera traps to identify individual black leopards with the end goal of compiling a population estimate. The infrared makes the leopard\'s spots, hidden beneath the dark coat, stand out in photos, allowing scientists to tell individuals apart.""We are quite excited as, to our knowledge, this will be the first study investigating the population density of melanistic leopards in Malaysia,"" says Clements who is affiliated with James Cook University and University of Malaya.But even with its imposing presence and the mythos surrounding it, black panthers are in no way secure. Like all of the world\'s great cats, leopards—whether black or spotted—face numerous perils.""The threats to black leopards are similar to those faced by other large mammals in the area, which are mainly habitat loss and poaching,"" notes Clements. ""Large tracts of forests were recently cleared for a hydroelectric dam in the corridor, while poachers from Indochina still roam the forests and set snares targeting tigers.""There has been good news recently, however, as the state government froze all development along the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor pending a government study. If Malaysia\'s rainforests are preserved and anti-poaching laws enforced, this kingdom of the black panther may reign long.AN INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE HEDGES AND GOPALASAMY REUBEN CLEMENTSThe term ""black panther"" can actually refer to a number of different species of the felid genus Panthera such as the jaguar or leopard. In the same way a genetic mutation can cause some individuals within a species to display albino characteristics, black panthers are simply individuals that have a genotype causing a uniformly black coloration on their coat. As such, they are not considered a species. In total 13 species of wild felids have been documented with ""melanistic"" or black forms, but apart from the difference in coloration, they are still the same species as their patterned counter parts. The only \'black panther\' recorded in Peninsular Malaysia so far has been the black leopard ().While melanistic individuals of leopards can be found across its range, the Malay Peninsula is entirely unique - nowhere else in the world do melanistic individuals constitute almost the entire leopard population. A study by Kawanishi et al. 2010 in the Journal of Zoology, revealed that while leopards north of the Isthmus of kra between the Thai and Malay peninsula are mainly spotted, almost all records of leopards south of this famous ecological transition zone are melanistic. However in 2010, researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society and Panthera recorded a spotted leopard on their camera traps down in the southernmost state of Johor! So the Malay Peninsula is a really exciting place to study the evolutionary and genetic processes driving melanism in leopards.This has been something of a mystery. One hypothesis is that having a black coat may confer some kind of selective advantage to melanistic leopards. In Malaysia, for example, there is competition for prey between leopards and the Malayan tiger. Perhaps light conditions caused by a dense rainforest canopy allowed darker leopards to be more concealed and hence successful at hunting prey than spotted ones. Another theory is that a population crash of leopards in the region at some period may have left a few surviving individuals which, by chance, may have been black. This crash may have been caused by the super eruption of Mount Toba in Sumatra 74,000 years ago or changing sea levels. The remnant population would have created a ""founder effect,"" where offspring would inherit the genes of these few ""founders."" Alternatively, the genetic make-up of the population could have simply ‘drifted’ by chance towards melanism, due to the isolation from other leopards north of the Isthmus. Scientists believe that a combination of natural selection and random genetic drift probably resulted in today’s prevalence of melanistic leopards in Peninsular Malaysia.CONSERVATION OF THE BLACK LEOPARDWe still do not know if the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor is important for black leopards because a population density estimate for this species has yet to be determined in Malaysia. Based on our camera trap surveys so far, however, we do know that the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor is important for wild cat conservation—six out of eight of Peninsular Malaysia’s wild cat species can be found here, including the black leopard.We are currently working with the Terengganu State Government to improve the protection of this corridor, which is still threatened by habitat loss and poaching. We are happy that the state government has so far been receptive to our recommendations and has stepped up its commitment to protect the state’s natural heritage. For example, the state recently froze all development along the highway bisecting the corridor after we showed them the diversity of wildlife species detected by our camera traps in Kenyir. We are also currently working with the state wildlife and forestry departments to improve the enforcement capacity of the state to deter poaching in the corridor.The threats to black leopards are similar to those faced by other large mammals in the area, which are mainly habitat loss and poaching. Large tracts of forests were recently cleared for a hydroelectric dam in the corridor, while poachers from Indochina still roam the forests and set snares targeting tigers. There is hope however as the Terengganu state government has laudably stepped up efforts to address these threats in the corridor.We have been using infrared camera traps since 2010 to document the richness of mammals in the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor. We plan to continue our camera trapping surveys in Kenyir to provide long-term data for the Terengganu state government. Camera traps allow us to identify cat individuals with unique individual patterns such as tigers and clouded leopards. However, the uniform black coloration of the leopards makes identifying them from color photos quite impossible. As our camera traps are equipped with infrared light, the ""rosette"" spot patterns on their coat have become much clearer and we are now confident of identifying leopard individuals.We hope to determine population density estimates of the black leopard and other carnivore species in the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor, which can then be used as a baseline to compare with in later years. We are quite excited as, to our knowledge, this will be the first study investigating the population density of melanistic leopards in Malaysia. Ultimately, a long-term monitoring program in Kenyir would help us measure the effectiveness of our management interventions.To date, 43 mammal species have been recorded by our camera trap in this corridor, including 18 threatened mammal species according to the IUCN Red list. Also, at least 290 bird species have been documented in Kenyir, including 9 out 10 of Peninsular Malaysia’s hornbill species. Unfortunately, almost a quarter of the total, or 66 bird species, are threatened according to the IUCN. Finally, two species of the world\'s largest flower, the Rafflesia, can be found in this corridor. The Kenyir Wildlife Corridor therefore contains a large proportion of Terengganu’s natural heritage that we want to help preserve as much as possible. \n \n Related articles \n \n \n \n Development halted in crucial wildlife corridor in Malaysia \n \n \n \n (11/07/2012) Kenyir Wildlife Corridor in northeast Malaysia is teeming with wildlife: elephants, gibbons, tigers, tapirs, and even black panthers (melanistic leopards) have been recorded in the 60 kilometer (37 mile) stretch of forest. In fact, researchers have recorded over 40 mammal species (see species list below), including 15 threatened with extinction according to the IUCN Red List.

Native to the Arabian Peninsula, the Arabian leopard is today extremely rare — less than 200 animals are thought to survive in the wild. Despite the cat\'s precarious position, there is relatively little local enthusiasm to protect a species that is widely seen as a threat to livestock. Nevertheless one man in Yemen is trying to boost the value of leopard in the eyes of local people.

The rare leopards, an endangered species living on the Malay Peninsula, have been hard to identify because each one appeared the same—until now. The researchers discovered that the big cats actually have complex designs of spotting when viewed through an infrared flash, according to a press release. ""Most automatic cameras have an infrared flash, but it's only activated at night,"" says a researcher on the project. ""However, by blocking the camera's light sensor, we can fool the camera into thinking it's night even during the day, so it always flashes."" The spots make it easier for humans to identify and track black leopards, which should save more leopard lives. ""Understanding how leopards are faring in an increasingly human-dominated world is vital,"" says lead author Laurie Hedges. Few leopards actually live on the Malay Peninsula, perhaps due to poaching, while wire snares are killing them and wildlife markets are selling leopard body parts and skins. The rapid elimination of Malaysian forests is also depriving leopards of suitable habitats. The black panther—or leopard in Asia and Africa—has long had a ""mythical aura"" dating back to Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book and Stan Lee's creation of the Black Panther superhero, Mongabay.com reports. Another neat fact: The black leopard is ""perhaps the only known example of a wild mammal with virtually an entire population composed of black individuals,"" says Hedges.

Two other homes were damaged and as many as 25 people were evacuated on the 400 block of Daly Street, between 4th and 5th, where the collapse occurred. Police said an explosion was reported in the tightly-packed Whitman neighborhood at 11:09 a.m. Rubble from the collapsed home spilled into the street.

SCK Investments executive secretary, Steve Finney, said ""no comment"" when reached by phone and hung up. A message left for SCK President Cathy Finney-Hughes was not immediately returned. SCK Investments bought the property in March for $65,000, according to records with the city Office of Property Assessment. \n \n Fire Department Battalion Chief Mike Richey said that when emergency responders arrived in the minutes after the call, they found seven people injured and several houses damaged by the explosion. Initially, officials evacuated 22 houses adjacent to the mid-block collapse.

"['Spider-Man made his way into a Supreme Court decision today. In a case pitting inventor Stephen Kimble against Marvel Entertainment over an expired toy patent, the Court ruled to uphold a 50-year-old patent ruling that let the comics company stop sending royalty payments to Kimble — and they had a little bit of fun in reaching their decision. \n \n In law, with great power must come great responsibility \n \n Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment concerned Kimble\'s webshooter invention, a glove that shot foam string from its palm much like Spider-Man, which he patented in 1991. Marvel purchased the patent in 1997, and agreed to pay Kimble in royalties indefinitely. However, after discovering the 1964 Supreme Court decision Brulotte v. Thys, which determined that royalties need not be paid after a patent expires, the company stopped paying Kimble in 2010. Kimble thus sued Marvel, and brought the case to the Supreme Court late last year. \n \n However, the highest court in the land ruled in favor of Marvel, stating that Kimble\'s arguments to view his patent in light of modern competition law were overall invalid. However, Justice Elena Kagan peppered the Court\'s decision with a few fun references to superpowers, the \'60s Spider-Man animated series, and one of comics\' most famous adages: \n \n Justice Samuel Alito, who offered the dissenting opinion, failed to say ""It\'s Clobberin\' Time"" when arguing to overturn the Brulotte decision.

But when it uncovered a 1964 Supreme Court decision that found royalties could cease once a patent expired, Marvel in 2010 halted payments. It's a ruling that's perhaps garnering more headlines than usual, thanks to the number of comic-book jokes Elena Kagan incorporated into the opinion she wrote for the court.

"['Being bullied as a child can result in long-lasting psychological scars for both boys and girls, according to a U.S. study. \n \n Reviewing more than two decades of data, the researchers found that bullied children, regardless of their sex, face an elevated risk of developing anxiety disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts in later years. \n \n “We were surprised at how profoundly bullying affects a person’s long-term functioning,” the lead researcher, William Copeland, a clinical psychologist and epidemiologist at Duke University in Durham, N.C., said in a statement. \n \n “This psychological damage doesn’t just go away because a person grew up and is no longer bullied. This is something that stays with them. If we can address this now, we can prevent a whole host of problems down the road.” \n \n An earlier study, carried out in Finland, came to slightly different conclusions. Bullied boys seem to suffer few long-term problems, but the girls showed evidence of lasting psychological harm. The Finnish study relied on health-system data, but did not have access to individual case histories. \n \n The U.S. researchers said their new study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, is “most definitive to date in establishing the long-term psychological effects of bullying.” \n \n They said they used “a much richer data set” than the Finnish researchers. In particular, the analysis is based on a sample of 1,420 children from North Carolina. At the time of recruitment into the study, the kids were either 9, 11 or 13 years of age. The children and their parents, or caregivers, were interviewed each year until the youngsters turned 16, and then periodically thereafter. At each assessment, they were asked if the kids had been bullied in the preceding months, or had bullied others. \n \n A total of 421 participants reported being bullied at least once. And 198 youngsters admitted bullying others: 112 were bullies only, while 86 were both bullies and victims. \n \n Of the original 1,420 children, about 1,270 were followed into adulthood. \n \n “Those who said they had been bullied, plus those who were both victims and aggressors, were at higher risk for psychiatric disorders compared with those with no history of being bullied. The young people who were only victims had higher levels of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and agoraphobia,” according to the study. \n \n What’s more, the study found that those who had been bullies were at increased risk of antisocial personality disorders.', 'Victims of bullying at school, and bullies themselves, are more likely to experience psychiatric problems in childhood, studies have shown. Now researchers have found that elevated risk of psychiatric trouble extends into adulthood, sometimes even a decade after the intimidation has ended. \n \n The new study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry on Wednesday, is the most comprehensive effort to date to establish the long-term consequences of childhood bullying, experts said. \n \n “It documents the elevated risk across a wide range of mental health outcomes and over a long period of time,” said Catherine Bradshaw, an expert on bullying and a deputy director of the Center for the Prevention of Youth Violence at Johns Hopkins University, which was not involved in the study. \n \n “The experience of bullying in childhood can have profound effects on mental health in adulthood, particularly among youths involved in bullying as both a perpetuator and a victim,” she added. \n \n The study followed 1,420 subjects from Western North Carolina who were assessed four to six times between the ages of 9 and 16. Researchers asked both the children and their primary caregivers if they had been bullied or had bullied others in the three months before each assessment. Participants were divided into four groups: bullies, victims, bullies who also were victims, and children who were not exposed to bullying at all. \n \n Participants were assessed again in young adulthood — at 19, 21 and between 24 and 26 — using structured diagnostic interviews. \n \n Researchers found that victims of bullying in childhood were 4.3 times more likely to have an anxiety disorder as adults, compared to those with no history of bullying or being bullied. \n \n Bullies who were also victims were particularly troubled: they were 14.5 times more likely to develop panic disorder as adults, compared to those who did not experience bullying, and 4.8 times more likely to experience depression. Men who were both bullies and victims were 18.5 times more likely to have had suicidal thoughts in adulthood, compared to the participants who had not been bullied or perpetuators. Their female counterparts were 26.7 times more likely to have developed agoraphobia, compared to children not exposed to bullying. \n \n Bullies who were not victims of bullying were 4.1 times more likely to have antisocial personality disorder as adults than those never exposed to bullying in their youth. \n \n The effects persisted even after the researchers accounted for pre-existing psychiatric problems or other factors that might have contributed to psychiatric disorders, like physical or sexual abuse, poverty and family instability. \n \n “We were actually able to say being a victim of bullying is having an effect a decade later, above and beyond other psychiatric problems in childhood and other adversities,” said William E. Copeland, lead author of the study and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center. \n \n Bullying is not a harmless rite of passage, but inflicts lasting psychiatric damage on a par with certain family dysfunctions, Dr. Copeland said. “The pattern we are seeing is similar to patterns we see when a child is abused or maltreated or treated very harshly within the family setting,” he said. \n \n One limitation of the study is that bullying was not analyzed for frequency, and the researchers’ assessment did not distinguish between interpersonal and overt bullying. It only addressed bullying at school, not in other settings. \n \n Most of what experts know about the effects of bullying comes from observational studies, not studies of children followed over time. \n \n Previous research from Finland, based on questionnaires completed on a single occasion or on military registries, used a sample of 2,540 boys to see if being a bully or a victim at 8 predicted a psychiatric disorder 10 to 15 years later. The researchers found frequent bully-victims were at particular risk of adverse long-term outcomes, specifically anxiety and antisocial personality disorders. Victims were at greater risk for anxiety disorders, while bullies were at increased risk for antisocial personality disorder.']",2,"– Bullied kids are at greater risk of a range of psychological problems years later, a study suggests. ""Psychological damage doesn’t just go away because a person grew up and is no longer bullied,"" says a researcher. And that applies to both sexes, the study finds, challenging earlier research that suggested the long-term toll was more pronounced among girls. This study referred to ""a much richer data set,"" researchers say. ""We were actually able to say being a victim of bullying is having an effect a decade later."" Children in North Carolina joined the study at age nine, 11, or 13. Researchers collected data by interviewing the kids and their parents, following 1,270 of them into adulthood, the Globe and Mail reports. Victims had ""higher levels of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and agoraphobia,"" the study says. They suffered 4.3 times the anxiety disorder risk of children with no bullying in their pasts, the New York Times reports. Bullies themselves faced a higher risk of antisocial personality disorders, while male victims and bullies faced 18.5 times the risk of suicidal thoughts."
"['A lawsuit filed Monday by 10 Sandy Hook victims’ families claims Adam Lanza would not have been able to kill 26 people in five minutes without his “weapon of choice,” a Bushmaster AR-15. \n \n “The number of lives lost in those 264 seconds was made possible” by the rifle that was “engineered to deliver maximum carnage with extreme efficiency,” according to the lawsuit against AR-15 manufacturer Bushmaster. \n \n The lawsuit was filed Monday morning in Connecticut superior court against Bushmaster, several other manufacturers, and Riverview Gun Sales, where Lanza’s rifle was purchased. \n \n These defendants know that “as a result of selling AR-15s to the civilian market, individuals unfit to operate these weapons gain access to them... Despite that knowledge, defendants continue to sell the XM15-E52 rifle to the civilian market.” \n \n In making the case against any civilian sales of AR-15s, the plaintiffs say—among other things—“there is not a single state that requires a mental-health examination of a potential purchaser of an AR-15” or to “answer questions about other individuals with whom they intend to share access.” \n \n The reference is unmistakably to Nancy Lanza, who purchased the AR-15 that her son would use to massacre 20 first-grade students and six adults before taking his own life. \n \n Under the title “The Road to Sandy Hook,” the lawsuit painstakingly details the use of the AR-15 in other mass shootings, including those at schools. Yet Bushmaster continued to market the AR-15 as a weapon that would make others “bow down” and kept selling high-capacity magazines with it. \n \n After recounting the individual lives taken by Lanza and his Bushmaster AR-15, the lawsuit says the defendants “knew, or should have known” that the sale of the AR-15 “posed an unreasonable and egregious risk of physical injury to others.” In addition, it should’ve known it would’ve been used in a mass shooting to inflict maximum casualties. \n \n The families created estates in their childrens’ names (with parents as administrators) so they could sue on behalf of the victims. Bushmaster and the other defendants’ conduct, the plaintiffs say, was a “substantial factor resulting in the following injuries and losses.” They are listed for the dead as “terror; ante-mortem pain and suffering; destruction of the ability to enjoy life’s activities; destruction of earning capacity, and death.” \n \n The plaintiffs claim damages in excess of $15,000 and seek further relief for monetary damages, puntitive damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief.', 'In an article appearing on Today Parents, Nicole Hockley writes a letter to the mom she was before she lost her youngest son Dylan in the Dec. 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. \n \n ""The tragedy changed every single aspect of your life, not only because of the obvious absence of your child, but because of the constant hole inside you that can never be filled,"" Hockley writes. \n \n In the letter, Hockley goes on to talk about gun violence prevention and recognizing the signs of a troubled child, asking parents to get involved by talking to their children, other parents and educators about these issues. \n \n ""Small but meaningful actions create change,"" Hockley writes. \n \n \n \n Read Hockley\'s letter to herself here.', 'The car driven by Adam Lanza is pictured at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in this evidence photo released by the Connecticut State Police, December 27, 2013. \n \n A woman kneels with her children in front of bells which were being rung outside of St. Rose of Lima Church ahead of Sunday service on the two-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut December 14, 2014. \n \n NEWTOWN, Conn. Parents of almost half the young children killed by a gunman at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, two years ago on Sunday have taken initial steps toward filing lawsuits tied to one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. \n \n For a second straight year the leafy suburb has planned no public events to commemorate the massacre, which left 20 first graders and six educators dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School, an incident that inflamed the U.S. debate over gun control. \n \n The parents of eight of the children killed in the Dec. 14, 2012, carnage, which 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza ended by shooting himself dead as he heard police sirens approach, have notified Connecticut courts that they may file wrongful death lawsuits in state or federal court. \n \n Their initial court filings, related to legal entities created in memory of their children, do not indicate who the families could target in their lawsuits, according to a chief court clerk for North Fairfield County Probate Court. \n \n While the parents could not be reached for comment, a spokesman for Bridgeport law firm Koskoff, Koskoff and Bieder said that a lawyer at the firm had recently met with some of the Newtown parents about potential suits. \n \n ""Attorney Josh Koskoff has met with parents about legal action,"" said Geraldo Parrilla, a legal assistant with the firm. \n \n While Newtown grabbed the nation\'s attention, school shootings remain common across the United States. Some 95 incidents, including fatal and nonfatal assaults, suicides and unintentional shootings have taken place across 33 states since Newtown, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a group created by the merger of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a group founded after the attack. \n \n ""It\'s astounding,"" said Shannon Watts, who founded the Moms group. ""There is no other developed country that would tolerate this kind of gun violence around school age children."" \n \n Gun-rights advocates note that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms and suggested after the attack that armed guards in schools could avert future violence. \n \n Newtown, located some 78 miles (126 kilometers) northeast of New York City, has razed the school that was site of the attack and recently acquired the home where Lanza lived with his mother, who he shot dead as the first act of his rampage. That building may also be torn down. \n \n Newtown plans no public ceremonies to mark Sunday\'s anniversary of the shootings. \n \n ""The second anniversary, like the first one last year, will be recognized in personal reflection and remembrance,” said Newtown\'s highest elected official, First Selectman Patricia Llodra, and Superintendent of Schools Joseph Erardi, in a statement ... “There are no formal or official ceremonies to be held by the town or school district."" \n \n But a 12-member commission that includes four parents of young victims of the attack is steadily moving ahead to create a permanent memorial to honor the dead. \n \n ""We are meeting monthly, but have taken December off out of respect for the families who lost their loves ones on that tragic day,"" said Kyle Lyddy, chairman of the Sandy Hook Permanent Memorial Commission that is entering its final phase of recommending either a single or multiple memorials. \n \n Lyddy said the panel is considering such proposals as an outdoor park and gardens, and indoor murals and art exhibits. He said the commission has not set a deadline because ""Our main goal is to get this right."" \n \n (Additional reporting by Barbara Liston in Orlando, Florida; Editing by Scott Malone and Bernard Orr)', 'Parents of some of the victims of the 2012 school shooting in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, will on Monday announce they are suing Bushmaster, the manufacturer of the gun used by Adam Lanza. \n \n They are working with an attorney who represented Michael Jackson’s family in a $1.5bn wrongful death lawsuit against his international concert promoter, and a Democratic lobbyist who worked in the Clinton administration and specialises in taking on major corporations, the Guardian has learned. \n \n \n \n Parents of at least 13 of the 20 young children killed in the December 2012 shooting have in the past two weeks opened estates in their names at the regional probate court, a necessary first step in filing a lawsuit over their deaths. Eleven of these sets of parents checked a box specifying that they intended to make a wrongful death claim. \n \n Sunday 14 December, the second anniversary of the killings, also marks the legal deadline for filing a wrongful death lawsuit over the incident in the civil courts. The Hartford Courant reported earlier this week that parents were discussing a legal action against Bushmaster, the North Carolina-based manufacturer of the AR-15 rifle that was used by Lanza. \n \n Asked whether notice of a lawsuit had been received, an employee in the legal department of Remington Outdoor Company, Bushmaster’s parent firm, referred the inquiry to the company’s public affairs director, who then did not respond to numerous emails, phone calls and voicemails this week seeking comment. \n \n The Guardian has confirmed that action is to be announced on Monday involving Michael Koskoff, a partner in the Connecticut law firm Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, who three years ago represented the Jackson family in their unsuccessful lawsuit against AEG Live, the promoter of a planned tour for which Jackson was rehearsing when he died in 2009. \n \n Joining his firm in promoting the action is Karen Hinton, a lobbyist and PR expert who once worked for the Democratic National Committee and is a close ally of Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, who described her as “my public relations guru” in his 2003 book Crossroads: the Future of American Politics. \n \n \n \n Hinton worked for Cuomo when he was housing secretary to then president Bill Clinton in the 1990s and is married to Howard Glaser, who was until earlier this year one of Cuomo’s most senior aides. \n \n “We are not going to be speaking about that until Monday,” Hinton said of Sandy Hook, declining to confirm what the parents’ plans were. \n \n Hinton, who states in her Twitter biography that she is “taking on big oil, big banks & other big bullies”, has represented clients including Ecuadorian villagers in a long-running multibillion-dollar legal battle with Chevron, the energy corporation, over pollution of the Amazon rainforest. \n \n According to records reviewed by the Guardian at Fairfield county probate court, estates were opened with notifications of wrongful death claims this month for Charlotte Bacon, Daniel Barden, Dylan Hockley, Jesse Lewis, Ana Marquez-Greene, James Mattioli, Grace McDonnell, Emilie Parker, Jack Pinto, Noah Pozner and Jessica Rekos. Estates were also opened for Avielle Richman and Benjamin Wheeler, but the box signifying a wrongful death claim was not checked.']",4,"– Two years ago yesterday, Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and fired 154 bullets in less than five minutes, killing 20 small children and six educators.

""The number of lives lost in those 264 seconds was made possible"" by the AR-15, which was ""engineered to deliver maximum carnage with extreme efficiency,"" reads the lawsuit; also named are Remington and Riverview Gun Sales, which sold Lanza's weapon.

"[""The White House is said to be considering Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-Nev.) as a nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) \n \n The White House is considering picking the Republican governor from Nevada to fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court, scrambling political calculations in what is expected to be a contentious confirmation battle in which Senate Republicans have pledged to play the role of roadblock. \n \n President Obama is weighing the selection of Brian Sandoval, a centrist former federal judge who has served as governor since 2011, according to two people familiar with the process. Though the review process is in its initial phases and it is unclear whether the governor could ultimately emerge as the president’s pick, even the prospect of his nomination poses a difficult dilemma for Senate Republicans who have promised not to consider any nomination before November’s elections. \n \n After The Washington Post published news of Sandoval’s consideration Wednesday, GOP leaders insisted that Obama nominating a Republican would make no difference. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who on Tuesday pledged “no action” on any Supreme Court nomination before the election, said in a statement that the nominee “will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the fall.” \n \n The No. 2 Senate Republican leader, Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, said likewise: “This is not about the personality.” \n \n [Republicans vow no hearings, no votes for Obama’s Supreme Court pick] \n \n White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Wednesday he would not comment specifically on whether the administration was considering Sandoval because he did not want “to get into a rhythm of responding” to every report on a potential nominee. But he said that Obama was committed to finding “the best person to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court,” regardless of party. \n \n “The president’s focused on criteria that, frankly, is more important, and that is that individual’s qualifications, and their experience and their view of the law,” Earnest said. “That will take precedence over any sort of political consideration.” \n \n Sandoval would represent an unconventional pick for the president, a former constitutional law professor who has prized prestigious law pedigrees and extensive legal backgrounds in the jurists he has previously selected for the Court. While the selection of a Republican could heighten the political pressure on Senate GOP leaders, it could also alienate the Democratic base and runs counter to Obama’s emphasis on taking a long view of who deserves to sit on the nation’s highest court. \n \n Speaking to reporters last week, the president said he planned to select someone with extraordinary legal credentials. “We’re going to find somebody who is has an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law,” he said. \n \n A Sandoval spokesman, Mari St. Martin, said Wednesday, “Neither Governor Sandoval nor his staff has been contacted by or talked to the Obama administration regarding any potential vetting for the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court.” \n \n It is clear, however, that Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid, a fellow Nevadan with whom Sandoval enjoys cordial relations, is playing a key role as intermediary. While visiting Washington for a meeting of the National Governors Association, Sandoval met with Reid in his Capitol office Monday. \n \n A person familiar with the conversation said that while Sandoval told Reid he had not made a final decision on whether he would accept a Supreme Court nomination, he would allow the vetting process to move forward. Another person in Nevada familiar with the process confirmed that it is underway. \n \n Asked about a potential nomination on Saturday, Sandoval told the Morning Consult, “It would be a privilege.” He called the Supreme Court “the essence of justice in this country.” \n \n [Everything you need to know about appointing a Supreme Court justice] \n \n In a Wednesday interview with CNN, Reid said he would endorse Sandoval for the nomination. “I don’t pick the justices, but I know if he were picked, I would support the man,” he said. “He’s a good person, has a great record, and has been a tremendously good governor in spite of having to deal with some very big problems there.” \n \n But in subsequent remarks to The Post, Reid tempered his praise and said he was “not pushing it with the White House” and was “just responding to people.” \n \n “He was a good judge. He’s been a very excellent governor. I like him very much. I would support him,” Reid said of Sandoval. “I would rather we had somebody a little more progressive…. I’ll do what I can, but I’m not pushing his name.” \n \n Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval spoke about his working-class roots during his address at the 2012 Republican National Convention. (Republican National Convention) \n \n It is unclear how many potential nominees are under White House consideration for the high court vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Obama was seen last week carrying a thick binder of materials on potential picks to review. \n \n As the standoff continued with Senate Republicans, Obama reiterated Wednesday morning that he intended to “do his job” by nominating a candidate during the remaining months of his presidency. \n \n Referring to McConnell and Senate Republicans on Wednesday morning, Obama said: “I recognize the politics are hard for them, because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing.” \n \n But he predicted that the Republican position “may evolve” if the public believes his nominee is “very well qualified.” \n \n “I don’t expect Mitch McConnell to say that is the case today. I don’t expect any member of the Republican caucus to stick their head out at the moment and say that. But let’s see how the public responds to the nominee that we put forward,” the president said. \n \n [Sign up for The Daily 202 and get all the news you need on the Scalia confirmation battle and the presidential campaign] \n \n Some Democrats see a Sandoval nomination as the best opportunity to fracture the front of Republican opposition and force McConnell to take up the nomination in this contentious election year. It would also put on the spot a handful of Senate Republicans who are up for reelection in blue states in November. \n \n Several Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, which is charged with considering a Supreme Court nominee, said Wednesday that it would not matter if Obama picked a Republican. \n \n “The short answer is no, it doesn’t change anything,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). \n \n But some Republican senators acknowledged a Sandoval pick would put GOP senators in a tough spot politically. \n \n “This is one reason why I have not wanted to shut the door on considering a nominee,” said Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), one of two Senate Republicans who is at least open to a confirmation hearing. “We may well be sent a nominee who is deserving of thorough vetting and consideration.” \n \n Another Republican senator aligned with the GOP court blockade, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly, said a Sandoval nomination would “mix it up” for Republicans. But the lawmaker also said he doubted that Democrats would unite behind Sandoval. \n \n \n \n Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) is being vetted for the vacancy on the Supreme Court (AP Photo/Cathleen Allison, File) \n \n Nominating Sandoval would carry clear political risks for Obama. Sandoval is aligned with Democrats on some key issues, including abortion rights and the environment. As governor, he has moved to implement the Affordable Care Act, and has said he considers same-sex marriage to be a settled issue. \n \n [Who is Brian Sandoval?] \n \n But Sandoval is not seen as labor-friendly — potentially alienating a swath of the Democratic base. His legal credentials are also lacking compared to some of the other names under consideration who are mainly sitting federal judges. And he initially called the landmark health-care law “unconstitutional,” signing onto a brief in 2012 challenging the constitutionality of the measure’s individual mandate. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected that argument, and upheld the law. \n \n A Senate confirmation of Sandoval through this year could deny a Democratic successor to Obama, whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the opportunity to nominate a more orthodox liberal to the court and cement an ideological shift in its jurisprudence. \n \n Liberal activist groups quickly registered their displeasure with the idea of a Justice Sandoval. Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, said in a statement it was “downright absurd that President Obama would risk his legacy by appointing another anti-labor Republican like Brian Sandoval to an already overwhelmingly pro-big-business Supreme Court.” \n \n “Nominating someone like Sandoval would not only prevent grass-roots organizations like DFA from supporting the president in this nomination fight, it could lead us to actively encouraging Senate Democrats to oppose his appointment,” Chamberlain said. \n \n [Democrats troll GOP by floating a Republican for Supreme Court] \n \n The Senate unanimously confirmed Sandoval as a district court judge in 2005 after he was nominated by President George W. Bush. The Nevada Republican stepped down from the bench in 2009 to run for governor and is now counted among the most popular governors in the nation. He also represents a swing state with a heavy concentration of Latinos who will be important in the presidential race. \n \n One Republican who is considered likely to support Sandoval if nominated is Nevada’s junior senator, Dean Heller. \n \n Heller suggested in a statement last week that the “chances of approving a new nominee are slim,” but he did not discourage Obama from putting forth a nominee. \n \n “[W]ho knows, maybe it’ll be a Nevadan,” he said — a comment widely interpreted as signaling his support for Sandoval. \n \n In a parallel story line, Reid and Sandoval have long had a symbiotic political relationship that sometimes defied logic. \n \n Elected as the state’s attorney general in 2002, Sandoval quickly became one of the more popular Republicans in Nevada. In early 2005, Reid began pushing Sandoval to take a seat on the state’s U.S. District Court – a move that political insiders viewed as a savvy one to take Sandoval off the potential field of rivals who might run against Reid in his 2010 Senate race. \n \n Sandoval was nominated and then confirmed as a federal judge in October 2005 without any opposition, clearing the Senate Judiciary Committee by a voice vote and then winning full Senate confirmation by an 89-0 vote. Four years later, as then-Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons’s popularity was imploding amid a variety of scandals, the state’s GOP elites persuaded Sandoval to bail them out and challenge Gibbons in a June 2010 primary. \n \n Sandoval ousted Gibbons — and in November 2010, he routed Rory Reid, 53 percent to 41 percent, knocking off the Senate leader’s son. \n \n Harry Reid, who is retiring in 2016, won his own reelection that year in a bid that left some surprised by the senator’s seeming reluctance to help boost his son’s campaign against Sandoval. \n \n As governor, Sandoval alienated many conservatives by accepting the Medicaid expansion that was a cornerstone of Obama’s Affordable Care Act. One of his recent budgets, passed over the opposition of many Republicans in the legislature, included tax hikes designed to boost funding for the state’s notoriously underperforming public schools. \n \n As the 2016 election cycle got underway a year ago, Washington Republicans set their sights on Sandoval as their top recruit to try to challenge Reid. However, in public and private, the governor made clear that he had little interest in running in a competitive primary and then challenging Reid in the general election. Reid is retiring in 2016, leaving a competitive open Senate seat behind him. \n \n All this occurred while Reid repeatedly praised Sandoval for his positions on health care, taxes and education. And when the Senate Democratic leader announced in late March 2015 that he would not run for reelection, Sandoval returned the favor by praising his one-time patron for the federal judgeship. \n \n “From humble beginnings in Searchlight to the United States Senate, Senator Reid’s story is one that represents the Nevada and American dream,” Sandoval said. \n \n Paul Kane contributed to this report."", 'President Obama called on Senate Republicans Wednesday to ""fulfill their constitutional duties"" and consider a Supreme Court nominee this year, questioning their reasoning for vowing not to consider his choice to replace Antonin Scalia. \n \n ""I recognize the politics are hard for them because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing,"" he told reporters during a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan. ""But that\'s not our job. Our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties."" \n \n ""And so my hope and expectation is that once there is an actual nominee, once this is no longer an abstraction, that those on the Judiciary Committee recognize that their job is to give this person a hearing, to show the courtesy of meeting with them,"" he continued. ""They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates as to whether this person is qualified or not."" \n \n He added that it\'s up to the American public to decide whether or not his eventual nominee is qualified for the position--and public support for the candidate would make it tougher for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to summarily deny that person a hearing. \n \n ""I think it will be very difficult for Mr. McConnell to explain how, if the public concludes that this person\'s very well-qualified, that the Senate should stand in the way simply for political reasons,"" he said. ""We\'ll see what happens. I think the situation may evolve over time. I don\'t expect Mitch McConnell to say that is the case today. I don\'t expect any member of the Republican caucus to stick their head out at the moment. But let\'s see how the public responds to the nominee that we put forward."" \n \n Obama also said the argument about holding off nominating someone because he\'s a ""lame-duck president"" doesn\'t hold water because he still has a year left in office. \n \n ""There\'s an argument that well, the president shouldn\'t do this because he is a lame duck,"" he said. ""Well, the truth of the matter is that traditionally the term lame duck refers to the two or three months after an election has taken place in which a new president is about to be sworn in. I\'ve got a year to go. I don\'t think they would approve of me abdicating on my duties as commander-in-chief and to stop doing all the other work that I\'ve got to do."" \n \n As for how he\'s going to choose a nominee, the president on Wednesday penned a guest post on SCOTUSblog, a popular Supreme Court analysis website, detailing the qualities he looks for in a nominee and assuring readers that naming a bench appointment is ""a duty that I take seriously."" \n \n For Mr. Obama, the first prerequisite for a justice who would replace the late Antonin Scalia is that the person ""be eminently qualified."" \n \n ""He or she will have an independent mind, rigorous intellect, impeccable credentials, and a record of excellence and integrity,"" the president wrote. ""I\'m looking for a mastery of the law, with an ability to hone in on the key issues before the Court, and provide clear answers to complex legal questions."" \n \n But the president also emphasized a nonpartisan nominee to the court, which has been back in session since Monday. \n \n His chosen appointment would be ""someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary\'s role; who understands that a judge\'s job is to interpret the law, not make the law."" \n \n The future justice he promised to seek would hand down decisions on court cases ""without any particular ideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice, a respect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand."" \n \n And Mr. Obama\'s third requirement for the nation\'s highest bench: life experience. \n \n ""I\'m also mindful that there will be cases that reach the Supreme Court in which the law is not clear. There will be cases in which a judge\'s analysis necessarily will be shaped by his or her own perspective, ethics, and judgment,"" the president said. ""That\'s why the third quality I seek in a judge is a keen understanding that justice is not about abstract legal theory, nor some footnote in a dusty casebook."" \n \n ""It\'s the kind of life experience earned outside the classroom and the courtroom,"" he added, ""experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people\'s lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times."" \n \n He also hinted at a potential timetable for when he would officially tap a nominee, saying that he would fulfill that presidential duty ""in the weeks ahead."" \n \n When he does choose to name Scalia\'s successor, Mr. Obama will be fighting an uphill battle to get his nominee confirmed. \n \n On Tuesday, Senate Republicans reached a consensus that they would block all attempts at holding confirmation hearings for the president\'s nominee. \n \n ""I believe the overwhelming view of the Republican conference of the Senate is that this nomination, this vacancy, should not be filled by this lame-duck president,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters earlier this week after conferring with members of the GOP. Others, including former presidential candidate and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who sits on the Judiciary committee, had said earlier in the day that there would be ""no hearing, no votes."" \n \n But in his SCOTUSblog post, the president closed with his hope that the Senate would cooperate in the future and ""fulfill their constitutional responsibility"" to consider his nominee. \n \n ""I hope they\'ll move quickly to debate and then confirm this nominee so that the Court can continue to serve the American people at full strength,"" he said.']",2,"– President Obama on Wednesday told the Senate to do its job and at least give his eventual Supreme Court nominee a hearing: ""They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates,"" he told reporters, per CBS News, but it's clear their ""constitutional duties"" include at least allowing a hearing. A hearing on whom? Well, per multiple sources who spoke to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, the White House is currently vetting Brian Sandoval, the Republican governor of Nevada. He's described as a ""centrist"" by the Post, who says ""some key Democrats"" see him as ""perhaps the only nominee"" Obama might be able to get Republicans to consider. Mitch McConnell and the Judiciary Committee have pledged to take no action on any Supreme Court nominee from Obama. Would that change if the nominee is a member of their own party? Three GOP senators who sit on the Judiciary Committee all said no, but other Republican senators say getting a nominee like Sandoval could be cause to reconsider. Some Democrats believe nominating Sandoval would put some Republicans up for re-election in November in an awkward position, and could ultimately force the Senate to break its blockade. Sandoval, who has a ""bipartisan record"" per the Post and is aligned with Democrats on abortion rights and the environment, met with Harry Reid Monday, and a source says he allowed the vetting process to proceed but said he hadn't decided whether he'd accept a nomination. It's not clear how many potential nominees the White House is considering, but the Journal notes there are likely more."
"['If Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has really carried out a chemical attack, it wouldn’t be the first time poisonous gas brought death in the Middle East country. \n \n Indeed, right in Syria archaeologists have found some of the oldest evidence of chemical warfare. \n \n According to University of Leicester archaeologist Simon James, who published his findings back in 2009, poison gas was used in Syria more than 1,700 years ago when a Roman fort at Dura-Europos became the site of a violent siege by the powerful Sasanian Persian empire. \n \n BLOG: Why a Chemical Threat in Syria Is Terrifying \n \n No historical record exists of the battle, which occurred around 256 A.D., but archaeological remains, unearthed by major excavations in 1920-1937 by teams from France and Yale University, and after 1986 by French-Syrian teams, helped James piece together the action. \n \n Trying to enter the city, the Sasanians dug tunnels underneath its walls. Intending to hold their ground at all costs, Roman defenders responded with counter-mines. \n \n In the 1930s, archaeologists unearthed dramatic evidence of the fight. In one of the tunnels, a pile of bodies, still completely fitted with their weapons and armour, testified to the horrors of the battle. \n \n At the time, the researchers believed the trapped Roman soldiers had died after the tunnel collapsed. But according to James, residue of pitch (a resinous substance) and yellow sulfur crystals found in a jar lying near the bodies indicated a much more gruesome reality. \n \n Indeed, the Sasanians placed fire pits strategically throughout the tunnel, and when the Romans broke through, they gassed them by adding sulfur crystals and bitumen to the fire. \n \n BLOG: Why Chemical Weapons Cross the ‘Red Line’ \n \n “Defining what constitutes a chemical weapon in antiquity is complex, but this is certainly one of the earliest archaeological finds of the addition of chemical accelerants to a fire to produce toxic fumes,” Adrienne Mayor, a research scholar in classics and history of science at Stanford University, told Discovery News. \n \n Mayor described the skirmish in the tunnel and the presence of burnt residue as an early example of archaeological evidence for a chemical incendiary in her 2003 book “Greek Fire, Poison, Arrows and Scorpion Bombs.” \n \n According to the scholar, a possible contender for the earliest archaeological evidence for a chemical weapon is a charred, manmade fire ball from the archaeological battle site at Gandhara, Pakistan. \n \n “The burning missile had been hurled at Alexander’s besieging army in 327 BC. Chemical analysis revealed the ball’s composition included sulfur, barite, and pitch,” Mayor said. \n \n The ball was certainly ignited in a fire, but whether this was deliberate or accidental is impossible to establish. \n \n NEWS: What Are the Rules of War? \n \n Long before World War I, when 39 different toxic agents — ranging from simple tear gas to mustard gas — were extensively used, it was a mixture of sulfur and pitch that gassed enemies. \n \n Greek historian and Athenian general Thucydides described how, during the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans created a sulfur and pitch (in this case pine resin) fire at the siege of Plateia, Greece, in 429 BC. \n \n The Boeotians, Sparta’s allies, used a similar chemical flame-thrower in 424 BC at Delium, combining burning coal, sulfur and pitch. \n \n Aeneas Tacticus (360 B.C.), one of the earliest Greek writers on the art of war, suggested combining pitch and sulfur to defend against sieges. \n \n “These are the earliest recorded uses of a chemically enhanced incendiary to create a poison gas,” Mayor said. \n \n “The combustion of sulfur creates toxic sulfur dioxide gas. The fumes are lethal if inhaled in large quantities,” she added. \n \n Image: At the Palmyrene Gate, the principal entrance to the city of Dura Europos, toxic gas brought death more than 1,700 years ago.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.']",2,"– Amid all the uproar over chemical weapons in Syria comes this surprising revelation: What could be the earliest archaeological evidence of chemical weapons was uncovered in the country—and it is some 1,700 years old. A mixture of sulfur and pitch combined with fire was the first way humans gassed their enemies, explains Discovery News. It dredges up 2009 findings by British archaeologist Simon James, who asserts that such a poison gas was used during a siege on the Roman-controlled city of Dura-Europos around AD 256. The site was excavated throughout the 20th century, first in 1920; in the next decade, the bodies of 20 armor-clad Roman soldiers were found in one of the counter-mines they dug in order to access the tunnels made by the invading Sasanian Persians. The original theory was that the collapse of the tunnel killed them. But James offered proof that the Romans were actually gassed: A jar near the bodies contained residue composed of pitch and yellow sulfur crystals. National Geographic shares James' explanation: ""I think the Sasanians placed braziers and bellows in their gallery, and when the Romans broke through, added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the Roman tunnel."" Death would have come within minutes. There is one bit of archaeology that could predate it: a sulfur and pitch fireball that struck Alexander’s army in 327 BC. But a Stanford research scholar notes that there's no way to determine whether it was purposefully or accidentally ignited.

"['Oakland pair indicted on terrorism charges for mink-freeing spree \n \n A pair of Oakland animal-rights activists were arrested on federal terrorism charges Friday for allegedly driving more than 40,000 miles across the country to save the hides of 5,000 mink destined to become furs, authorities said. \n \n Joseph Buddenberg, 31, and Nicole Kissane, 28, were both charged with conspiracy to violate the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act during a nationwide vandalism spree that crisscrossed the country in the summer of 2013, said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. \n \n The pair allegedly traveled as far as the East Coast — stopping along the way at fur farms in Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana and Pennsylvania — freeing mink from cages and in one case a bobcat while also committing various acts of vandalism against businesses, business owners and employees in the fur industry, according to court records. \n \n “Whatever your feelings about the fur industry, there are legal ways to make your opinions known,” Duffy said in a statement. “The conduct alleged here, sneaking around at night, stealing property and vandalizing homes and businesses with acid, glue and chemicals, is a form of domestic terrorism and can’t be permitted to continue.” \n \n In one instance detailed in the indictment, Buddenberg and Kissane allegedly drove from Oregon to Southern California armed with used paint, paint stripper, Super Glue and two different types of acid to vandalize Furs by Graf, a furrier in San Diego, and the homes of both its current and former owner in Spring Valley and La Mesa, suburbs east of the city. \n \n Among their other exploits, the pair broke windows out at a Bay Area market, slashed the tires of a San Francisco meat distributor truck, glued shut the locks at a fur business in Minneapolis and attempted to flood the Sun Prairie, Wis., home of an employee who worked at a fur auction house, prosecutors said. \n \n Buddenberg and Kissane, who authorities said were unemployed during their vandalism spree, allegedly raised cash for their free-the-mink spree trip by selling items on eBay. They also stopped using cell phones and used encrypted e-mail while on the road to avoid detection by law enforcement, according to the indictment. \n \n To publicize their crimes, court documents allege, the pair used publicly available computers to post what the FBI called “communiques” to extreme animal rights websites. \n \n Buddenberg was the target of federal agents at least once before when, in 2009, he was charged with threatening researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. Those charges were eventually thrown out by a judge who said prosecutors filed a vague indictment that failed to specify any illegal acts. \n \n If convicted, Buddenberg and Kissane could face up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. The pair have both been released on bond and are due back in court on Tuesday, officials said. \n \n Kale Williams is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Joseph Buddenberg and Nicole Kissaneare accused of vandalizing a family-run fur shop in San Diego, freeing thousands of minks from Idaho to Pennsylvania and trying to flood the home of a fur auctioneer employee in Wisconsin. \n \n Prosecutors say their alleged actions weren’t merely illegal, but a form of domestic terrorism. \n \n The Oakland pair was arrested Friday by the FBI, accused of embarking on a 40,000-mile cross-country rampage on the fur industry. Their actions caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Diego said. \n \n Kissane, 28, who used to live in Escondido, and Buddenberg, 31, originally from Virginia Beach, have been indicted on charges of conspiracy to violate the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. Both were expected to be transferred from Oakland to San Diego to face the charges. \n \n Vintage furs at Furs by Graf.— Louie Juarez + Read Caption Share Photo \uf610 \n \n \uf611 \n \n \uf616 \n \n ✉ \n \n “We’ve been targeted over 30 years by these terrorists and we’re pleased law enforcement is able to apprehend people,” said Kimberley Graf, whose family owns the San Diego fur shop that was vandalized. \n \n The covert road trips occurred the summer and fall of 2013, according to the indictment unsealed Friday. \n \n It began in June 2013, when they drove from Portland, Ore., to Southern California in a Honda Fit, the indictment states. \n \n On July 15, 2013, according to the charges, the pair trashed Furs by Graf in Kearny Mesa. The San Diego store was spray-painted – markings that included the words “killer” and “murder” – and the windows were destroyed with etching materials. Acid was sprayed into the shop and glue was put on the door locks. \n \n Acid, paint and paint stripper were also used on the La Mesa and Spring Valley homes of store manager Graf and her parents. Graf said she hopes her family will be able to recover restitution for the damage incurred. \n \n The court document lays out Buddenberg and Kissane’s alleged cross-country path after that: \n \n • In Montana, they are accused of releasing a bobcat from Frazier Fur Farm in Plains, then the next day vandalizing the vehicles of the police chief in Darby, who is disliked by animal-rights activists, according to the indictment. \n \n • In Idaho, they released about 1,800 mink from the Moyle Mink Ranch in Burley and destroyed the breeding grounds there, the indictment alleges. \n \n • In the Bay Area, they allegedly glued the locks of various animal-related businesses, slashed the tires on several trucks of a meat distributor and broke windows of a market, the indictment says. \n \n • In Minnesota, they allegedly smashed the windows and glued the locks of Ribnick Fur and Leather in Minneapolis, and later freed about 440 mink from Myhre Mink Ranch in Grand Meadow. \n \n • In Wisconsin, they are accused of vandalizing and trying to flood the Sun Prairie home of an employee of North American Fur Auctions, and later releasing about 2,000 mink from Bonlander Farms in New Holstein. \n \n • In Iowa, the indictment says, they freed up to 500 mink from the Donald B. Conrad Fur Farm in Keota. \n \n • In Pennsylvania, they released 1,000 mink from Rykola Mink Farm in Ebensburg, according to the indictment. \n \n “Communiqués” publicizing their actions were posted on websites associated with animal-rights extremism, authorities said. In the San Diego attack, a Florida animal-rights website posted a message from the Animal Liberation Front that claimed responsibility for the vandalism. The indictment does not mention whether Buddenberg and Kissane are part of any organization. \n \n Authorities say the pair carefully planned the excursions and tried to stay off the grid to avoid detection by law enforcement. \n \n They used only cash during their trips and avoided phones to avoid leaving traces, the indictment says. They are also accused of using encrypted email and public computers to access the Internet while on the road. \n \n The pair were unemployed – although public records show Kissane has a cosmetology license – and raised money for their road trips by selling items on eBay and Amazon, authorities said. \n \n In November and December 2013, authorities allege, the pair were in possession of various tools to carry out the crimes, including acid, wire cutters, handwritten lists of fur farms, latex gloves, super glue, walkie-talkies, a knife, encrypted computers and headlamps. \n \n “Whatever your feelings about the fur industry, there are legal ways to make your opinions known,” U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said in a statement. “The conduct alleged here, sneaking around at night, stealing property and vandalizing homes and businesses with acid, glue, and chemicals, is a form of domestic terrorism and can’t be permitted to continue.” \n \n The alleged spree was investigated by Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country, said San Diego’s FBI Special Agent in Charge Eric Birnbaum. \n \n Jerry Vlasak, a press officer with the North American Animal Liberation Press Office, emphasized that the pair are innocent until proven otherwise. \n \n He said in his opinion, forms of economic sabotage and the liberation of animals are legitimate tactics to use as part of the animal rights movement. \n \n “Whoever did these actions are heroes in our book. We support them 100 percent,” Vlasak said. \n \n He added that the “terrorism” label is describing the wrong side. “These people are abusing animals, taking fur-bearing animals, keeping them in cages, anally electrocuting them, skinning them and selling their fur to make a fashion statement and profit. If anyone is terrorizing anyone, it’s those terrorizing these animals.” \n \n This is not the first arrest for Buddenberg. He and three others were charged in 2009 in connection with violent protests outside the homes of UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley scientists. Buddenberg lived in Berkeley at the time. \n \n One of the other activists charged was an Oceanside man. The federal case was ultimately dismissed.']",2,"– Two animal rights activists who authorities say went on an epic vigilante road trip across the US have been arrested and face jail time.

One of Zirkle\'s dogs was hurt in the attack. \n \n ""Reportedly the snowmachiner made three separate attempts or passes at her including turning around several times,"" official Danny Seavey said in a video for the Iditarod Insider. ""She actually used one of the trail-markers to defend herself - the four-foot pieces of lath out there that are marking the trail."" \n \n According to a report by Alaska State Troopers, the snowmachiner attacked Zirkle at one point on the trail and then returned to meet her about 12 miles away from Nulato. ""The snow machine revved up and was pointed at her and then finally left the area with no further injuries to Zirkle or her team,"" Troopers wrote. \n \n Zirkle pulled up to the Nulato checkpoint at about 2:17 a.m. In a video by the Iditarod Insider, when asked how she was by a race official, she responded, ""Really bad... Someone tried to kill me with a snowmachine."" \n \n About 12 miles out of Nulato, Jeff King\'s team was also attacked by a snowmachiner. King was hit from behind and his three-year-old dog, Nash, was killed. Two other dogs, Banjo, 2, and Crosby, 3, were injured, according to race officials. \n \n A video of King arriving in Nulato at 3:25 a.m. by Iditarod Insider shows King telling race officials that he\'d had \'big problems.\' \n \n ""I was hit by a snowmachine. I have one dead and several hurt,"" King said to the official. \n \n In an interview with Channel 2 News, King said the snowmachine approached him \'in a blur.\' \n \n ""He went by me at high speed. It was so incredibly close -- my team was well lit, with lights and reflectors -- that it felt very intentional,"" King said. \n \n King tried to perform triage first aid on his dying and injured dogs. ""I stood there as my dogs struggled in pain, with broken limbs and in the throes of death, for one of them,"" King said. \n \n A piece of cowling from the snowmachine broke off during the attack on King\'s team and the musher brought it with him to Nulato as evidence. \n \n King requested medical treatment for his dogs at the checkpoint and did not report any injuries himself. \n \n Husky Homestead Tours, King\'s kennel, wrote in a message to Channel 2 that their crew at home was sad about what happened but were thankful that it was not worse. ""We also wish the best to Aliy as she continues to Nome,"" office manager Carrie Skinner wrote. \n \n The Village Public Safety Office confirmed to Channel 2 News that soon after the incident, a Nulato man called and confessed but Alaska State Troopers have not yet publicly identified a suspect. \n \n Both mushers plan to continue the race to Nome.', ""The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race — Alaska's “Last Great Race” — was reeling in the wake of a suspected snowmobile assault on two dog teams along a remote section of the Yukon River that left one dog dead and two others seriously injured. \n \n Alaska State Troopers said Saturday they had caught the snowmobiler responsible. They charged 26-year-old Arnold Demoski of Nulato, a community of about 350 people, with assault, reckless endangerment, reckless driving and criminal mischief after the incidents that left mushers Jeff King of Denali Park and Aliy Zirkle of Fairbanks badly shaken. \n \n Both mushers said they believed Demoski, who has a history of assault, intentionally tried to run them down on the trail in the dark of night. \n \n The Iditarod has witnessed dog deaths before after snowmobiles, or snow machines as they are commonly called in Alaska, accidentally veered into teams, but never a willful assault. \n \n Some residents of Nulato speculated that Demoski might simply have been trying to scare the mushers and then ran into them accidentally. \n \n In a taped interview with Anchorage television station KTUU, Demoski denied any intent to harm anyone. \n \n “It not was intentional,” he said. “That's not me. I don't do stuff like that.” \n \n Demoski gave similar statements to other media and claimed only to have been involved in an unfortunate accident while driving drunk. He did not know what had happened until sleeping off a night of drinking, he said. \n \n According to his version of events, he was driving in an alcoholic blackout and only put the facts together after waking up to find his snow machine damaged and everyone in the village talking about the dog teams run down. \n \n Jeff King Husky Homestead Nash, one of Jeff King's sled dogs, was killed by a snowmobile. Nash, one of Jeff King's sled dogs, was killed by a snowmobile. (Jeff King Husky Homestead) (Jeff King Husky Homestead) \n \n Still, he somehow remembered going back to see whether Zirkle was OK, and then deciding he didn't want to stop and talk to her because he might get in trouble. \n \n The 59-year-old King, a four-time Iditarod champ who suffered the loss of a dog named Nash, viewed the attack as intentional. He said his sled was well lit and easily visible when the snowmobile came screaming into it. \n \n King estimated Demoski's machine was doing 80 mph when it went past the front of his dog sled and slammed into the musher's team with such force the snowmobile's cowling came flying off. King collected the cowling and brought it into the Nulato checkpoint with his dead and injured dogs in the sled. \n \n The cowling matched that missing from Demoski's sled, which was parked in his yard. \n \n Officials of the Iditarod and the Nulato Tribal Council were quick to blame alcohol for what happened and express sympathy for the two mushers. \n \n “We are disturbed and saddened that celebrated Iditarod veteran dog teams led by Jeff King and Aliy Zirkle were struck by a resident of our village,” the tribe said in a written statement. “Nulato recognizes the complex behavioral health issues that impact our village and we ask for prayers as we seek wellness for all.” \n \n Nulato is what is known as a “damp” village in rural Alaska, where alcohol laws are complicated. Some villages ban booze. Some allow it. And some like Nulato live in between. There are no bars or liquor stores in the community, but alcohol is not banned. About 20 miles upriver, Koyukuk, home to about 100 people, is a “wet'' village, where alcohol can be bought at the Last Chance Liquor Store. \n \n The 46-year-old Zirkle, a three-time Iditarod runner-up, shared King's view that the snow machine assault looked intentional, not accidental. She twice told “Iditarod Insider,” a pay-per-view video news service run by Iditarod organizers, that the snowmobile driver “tried to kill me.” \n \n According to state troopers, Zirkle was about five miles downriver from Koyukuk headed for Nulato when her dog sled was first hit on “the side by a snow machine and the snow machine turned around multiple times and came back at her before driving off.” \n \n Those reports said the machine then went on down the river but later returned and approached her again about 12 miles out of Nulato. This time it aimed its headlight at her and revved its engine, but left without incident. Not long after, troopers allege the machine hit King's team from behind, killing the one dog and injuring five others, two seriously. \n \n Demoski's mother said troopers and a Nulato village public safety officer came and took her son to jail around noon Saturday after his interviews with reporters who were in the village to cover the Iditarod race. \n \n Janice Demoski was told her son was to be arraigned in Fairbanks on Sunday. She said she believed he had been in an accident. \n \n “They say it was an accident, so I believe it was,'' she said in telephone interview. \n \n The Demoskis are part of a large extended family in the Alaska Interior. Janice said Rudy Demoski, an Iditarod icon, is her husband's first cousin. Rudy, now 70 years old, ran the first Iditarod in 1974 and finished fourth. He grew up in a time when sled dogs were a way of life in Alaska. \n \n Most of the dogs are gone from rural Alaska now, and the snow machine has taken over. \n \n Among some villagers, the Iron Dog — a 2,000-mile race that follows the Iditarod route and goes well beyond it — has become more popular than the Iditarod. \n \n Reached by telephone at his home, Rudy Demoski said he didn't want to talk about the incident. \n \n “The bad part is my last name,” he said. \n \n The Iditarod dog race is Alaska's most cherished sport.

(Associated Press) \n \n ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A man suspected of intentionally driving a snowmobile into teams of two mushers near the front of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race has been arrested in a Yukon River village. \n \n Arnold Demoski, 26, of Nulato, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of assault, reckless endangerment, reckless driving and six counts of criminal mischief. \n \n Demoski spoke to KTUU-TV (http://bit.ly/1QPO4MH ), saying he was returning home from a night of drinking when he struck Aliy Zirkle and Jeff King\'s teams early Saturday morning. \n \n The crashes killed one of King\'s dogs and injured at least two others. One of Zirkle\'s dogs also was injured. Iditarod officials at first reported King had been injured. But the four-time champion said later the snowmobile had missed both him and his sled. \n \n Demoski said when he woke up Saturday morning and heard what had happened to the mushers, he checked his snowmobile and realized he had done it. The snowmobile was missing a part and had rust-colored stains, he said. \n \n Demoski said he doesn\'t remember the collisions, which the Iditarod described as apparently intentional attacks. \n \n ""I just want to say I\'m sorry,"" he said. \n \n Zirkle, 46, who finished second three times from 2012 to 2014, was mushing from Kokukuk to Nulato, a run of less than 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) on the Yukon River, when she was hit, race marshal Mark Nordman said Saturday. \n \n The snowmobile hit the side of Zirkle\'s sled about 5 miles (8.05 kilometers) outside of Koyukuk, turned around multiple times and came back at her before driving off, Alaska State Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said by email. \n \n The snowmobile reappeared 12 miles (19.31 kilometers) outside of Nulato. The driver revved up and was pointed at Zirkle before leaving, Peters said. \n \n Demoski told KTUU that he did not return to harass Zirkle. He said he wanted to check to make sure she was OK. \n \n One dog on Zirkle\'s team was bruised. Officials described the injury as non-life-threatening. \n \n Zirkle reached Nulato and told a race official the incident had left her shaken. \n \n ""I\'m really bad. Someone tried to kill me with a snowmachine,"" she said on a video posted to the Iditarod Insider webpage. Snowmachine is what Alaskans call snowmobiles. \n \n King, a four-time Iditarod champion, was behind Zirkle and fared worse. When King reached the vicinity 12 miles outside of Nulato, his team was struck from behind by the snowmobile. \n \n Nash, a 3-year-old male, was killed. Crosby, another 3-year-old male, and Banjo, a 2-year-old male, received injuries and are expected to survive. King told the Iditarod Insider the snowmobile narrowly missed him and his sled, but hit his dogs at high speed. \n \n ""One of my dogs was killed pretty much on the spot, and a couple others I gave first aid to the best I could and loaded them into my sled,"" he told the Iditarod camera crew. ""I kind of felt like a triage ambulance."" \n \n It did not appear to be an accident, he said. ""It seemed like an act of bravado,"" King said. \n \n Rural Alaska communities have many wonderful people, he said, but they also have serious social problems. \n \n ""It is beyond comprehension to me that this was not related to substance abuse,"" King said, adding that ""no one in their right mind would do what this person did."" \n \n King remained in Nulato early Saturday afternoon. \n \n The race leader early Saturday afternoon was Brent Sass, who left the village of Kaltag at 8:20 a.m. \n \n Zirkle rested four hours in Nulato and dropped one dog before heading back onto the Yukon River with 14 dogs in harness. She reached Kaltag at 10: 44 a.m., and after a nine-minute rest, left again in second place. \n \n Current champion Dallas Seavey left Kaltag at 11: 24 a.m. in third place. His father, former champion Mitch Seavey, was in fourth place. \n \n ___ \n \n This story has been corrected to show the positions, records of Mitch Seavey and Dallas Seavey.']",3,"– The 26-year-old Alaskan who says he was driving blackout drunk when he hit two Iditarod sled dog teams Saturday, killing one dog and injuring others, has been arrested and charged on suspicion of assault, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and six counts of criminal mischief, reports the Los Angeles Times. Arnold Demoski of Nulato is speaking quite freely with media, telling KTUU that the incident was not ""intentional. That's not me. I don't do stuff like that."" Mushers Jeff King and Aliy Zirkle, who were hit, beg to differ, telling authorities they believe the incident was intentional. King's 3-year-old dog, Nash, was killed. ""One of my dogs was killed pretty much on the spot, and a couple others I gave first aid to the best I could and loaded them into my sled,"" King says, per the AP. ""I kind of felt like a triage ambulance."" Demoski says he woke up after the morning after a night of drinking to discover that his snowmobile was missing its hood and had fresh, rust-colored stains on its sides. He called the village police officer to confess, he says. Asked whether he should face jail, Demoski tells KTUU that although he hopes to avoid it, he probably should go ""for at least some time."""

in student loan debt. But many of these newly minted doctors can, thanks to one government program, pay just a few hundred dollars a month on their loans—in some cases, far less than the interest that's being tacked on each month. And after 10 years, when the balance has swelled above $200,000, they can have whatever they owe wiped clean. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at this expanding class of borrower: graduate or professional-school students with a six-figure loan who don't expect or intend to pay it back. That attitude isn't a flouting of the rules. As the Journal reports, one 2012 program allows borrowers to pay a max of 10% of their discretionary income (that's any adjusted gross income beyond 1.5 times the poverty line.) And while undergrads are prevented from taking on more than $57,500 in federal loans, as of 2006 grad students stopped being restricted in a similar manner: Once they've borrowed $138,500 in government Stafford loans (that figure includes undergrad debt), the roughly 10-year-old Grad PLUS loans step in, in many cases eliminating the need to fill the gap using private loans. Grad PLUS was actually supposed to help taxpayers, because the interest rates on these loans were higher. But a 2007 measure allows those working full-time for a federal agency or nonprofit to have their balance wiped away if they make 10 years of payments (which, yes, can be capped at the aforementioned 10%) on time—at the taxpayers' expense. The Journal notes that 73% of America's hospitals are nonprofits or government owned, meaning doctors working there qualify."
"['In promoting her new book, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has come forward with several stories of being called ""chubby,"" ""fat,"" and ""porky"" by her male colleagues in Congress. \n \n In one incident from her early days in the Senate, Gillibrand describes an older senator who approached her from behind and squeezed her waist. ""Don’t lose too much weight now,"" she recalls him saying. ""I like my girls chubby.” \n \n It\'s one of many episodes she recounted in an interview with People magazine that is not yet online but which was reported by the New York Post on Wednesday. Most of the remarks were directed toward Gillibrand during her self-described struggle with her weight during and after her second pregnancy. \n \n In the House gym, she recalled, another of her male colleagues advised her to work out to avoid getting ""porky."" \n \n ""Thanks, a—hole,” she quipped in her book. \n \n In yet another instance, a Southern congressman held her arm as they walked down the chamber aisle, telling her, “[y]ou know, Kirsten, you’re even pretty when you’re fat."" \n \n Gillibrand also recounted the time a labor leader advised her to improve her looks if she wanted to win a special election for her Senate seat in 2010. \n \n “When I first met you in 2006 you were beautiful, a breath of fresh air. To win, you need to be beautiful again,"" he said. \n \n Last year in an exchange reported in the New Yorker, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) told Gillibrand: “I don’t want you to take this the wrong way, Kirsten, but you’re what my family would call a honey badger.” The remark, according to the New Yorker, was meant to compliment Gillibrand as ambitious and predatory. \n \n Gillibrand served from 2007-09 in the House before she was appointed to the Senate in 2009, filling the seat vacated by Hillary Clinton when she became secretary of state. Gillibrand won the above special election for the Senate seat in 2010 and was elected to a full term in 2012. \n \n Her book, ""Off The Sidelines,"" is scheduled to be released Sept. 9. Below is a promo video for the book:', '“Kirsten Gillibrand has written a handbook for the next generation of women to redefine their role in our world. With Off the Sidelines, Gillibrand shows that it’s not about getting to the top, or choosing between career and family—it’s simply about getting involved. In politics, in our communities, or simply mentoring somebody: When women work together, we all win.”—Arianna Huffington, editor in chief of The Huffington Post and author of Thrive \n \n \n \n “There are moments of immensely appealing self-disclosure that seldom appear in other books of this genre. . . . This isn’t your mother’s political memoir.”—The New York Times Book Review \n \n \n \n “Reading Kirsten Gillibrand’s book makes me so proud—as a woman, as an American, and as her friend. She is a beautiful example of what we can become when we are true to ourselves and brave enough to let our voices be heard. This book is intimately honest and deeply insightful. It should be on every girl’s and every woman’s reading list, and every boy’s and man’s, too.”—Connie Britton \n \n \n \n “What do you get when a woman is the third generation of fierce, kindhearted, and brilliant political activists? You get Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who writes irresistibly, helps in real-life terms, and uses her clout to get more women elected.

Now, she’s turning her attention to getting women involved—a powerful message delivered in her new memoir.”—Marie Claire \n \n \n \n “With her new memoir, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand seems to be taking a page out of the presidential playbook. . . . In style, however, Gillibrand’s book differs significantly from previous political memoirs. Hers is a quick read, chatty, candid.”—The Washington Post \n \n \n \n “In her poignant new memoir, Off the Sidelines, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand gives a voice to our nation’s unsung heroes—and shares how any one of us can help change our world.”—Good Housekeeping \n \n \n \n “Candid and inspiring.”—Dr. Oz The Good Life \n \n \n \n “Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, in offering this compellingly personal account of her journey to the U.S. Senate, fulfills a vital public purpose. Writing in a voice that is honest, funny, blunt, and strong, she urges women to get off the sidelines and start changing the world.”—Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and founder of LeanIn.Org \n \n \n \n “My good friend Kirsten Gillibrand has written a book that is just like her: bold, impactful, and inspiring.

Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL) and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC Wednesday evening June 18, 2014. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post) \n \n This post has been updated. \n \n New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) has a new book coming out, ""Off the Sidelines,"" and has been making the media rounds to promote it. The New York Post highlighted parts of the book today, in an article titled, ""Gillibrand: Male colleagues called me ‘porky’ after baby."" \n \n As awful as that headline is, things get worse in the book, according to the story. One quote in particular stands out. Gillibrand reveals that one male Senator, after she lost about 50 pounds, came up behind her and gave her waist a squeeze. “Don’t lose too much weight now,"" he told her. ""I like my girls chubby.” She says that he was one of her favorite senators(!). \n \n As Gillibrand\'s title infers, the book goes into detail about the things that women in politics still have to deal with that their male counterparts, well, don\'t. \n \n Yes, there are more women in Congress than ever before, but there are still far fewer women than men serving. There are 20 women in the Senate, and 79 women in the House. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, women make up only 24.2 percent of all state legislators. A 2013 article from the Texas Observer highlights how this is a problem for women legislators across the country. The reporter tells of the stories women politicians told her. \n \n Some told of senators ogling women on the Senate floor or watching porn on iPads and on state-owned computers, of legislators hitting on female staffers or using them to help them meet women, and of hundreds of little comments in public and private that women had to brush off to go about their day. Some said they often felt marginalized and not listened to—that the sexism in the Legislature made their jobs harder and, at times, produced public policy hostile to women. Yet, despite their strong feelings, women in the Capitol rarely talk about, except in the most private discussions, the misogyny they see all the time. It’s just the way the Legislature has always been. \n \n Gillibrand surely isn\'t alone in having to deal with such comments with her male colleagues at the Capitol, although some of her encounters are jaw-droppingly bad/offensive. When she was still in the House, a representative told her, “You know, Kirsten, you’re even pretty when you’re fat."" \n \n The New York Post has a few more examples, and Gillibrand\'s book -- which comes out on September 9 -- is probably teeming with them. \n \n Gillibrand often talks about women in politics -- and the problems she has with how they are treated and portrayed. For example, she has a big problem with ""House of Cards"" for this reason. She told CNN, ""My colleagues are much nicer. Most of the women in the series are portrayed as quite cold and calculating but my experience is I adore the female colleagues I have in the Senate."" She went on the Daily Show in 2012 to talk about why more women need to be elected. \n \n In case you were wondering, you can add Gillibrand as a ""no"" to the 2016 files; she\'s said during interviews she has no interest in entering the presidential race. However, Gillibrand has said repeatedly that Hillary Clinton should run.', 'A detailed report commissioned by two major Republican groups — including one backed by Karl Rove — paints a dismal picture for Republicans, concluding female voters view the party as “intolerant,” “lacking in compassion” and “stuck in the past.” \n \n Women are “barely receptive” to Republicans’ policies, and the party does “especially poorly” with women in the Northeast and Midwest, according to an internal Crossroads GPS and American Action Network report obtained by POLITICO. It was presented to a small number of senior aides this month on Capitol Hill, according to multiple sources. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n Republicans swore they’d turn around the party’s performance with women after Mitt Romney’s loss in 2012. And while they are in good shape in 2014, poised to pick up seats in the House and possibly take the majority in the Senate, the new report shows they have not improved their standing with women — which could exacerbate their problems if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee in 2016. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Dems paint GOP as shutdown party) \n \n The report — “Republicans and Women Voters: Huge Challenges, Real Opportunities” — was the product of eight focus groups across the country and a poll of 800 registered female voters this summer. The large-scale project was a major undertaking for the GOP groups. \n \n “The gender gap is hardly a new phenomenon, but nevertheless, it’s important for conservatives to identify what policies best engage women, and our project found multiple opportunities,” said Dan Conston, a spokesman for the American Action Network. “It’s no surprise that conservatives have more work to do with women.” \n \n Republicans in Washington say they recognize the problem. Republicans who have seen or been briefed on the polling were not surprised about the outcome. The poll was conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and Axis Research. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Jindal sues over Common Core) \n \n Paul Lindsey, the spokesman for Rove-backed Crossroads GPS, said, “There are a number of House policymakers and staff who have been willing to focus on issues important to women, and we think it’s important that they are aware of the policy solutions that are available to help address these concerns.” \n \n The solutions offered include neutralizing Democratic attacks that the GOP doesn’t support “fairness” for women; “deal honestly with any disagreement on abortion, then move to other issues”; and “pursue policy innovations that inspire women voters to give the GOP a ‘fresh look.’” \n \n The report is blunt about the party’s problems. It says 49 percent of women view Republicans unfavorably, while 39 percent view Democrats unfavorably. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Boehner, donors huddle in Wyoming) \n \n It also found that Republicans “fail to speak to women in the different circumstances in which they live” — as breadwinners, for example. “This lack of understanding and acknowledgment closes many minds to Republican policy solutions,” the report says. The groups urge Republicans to embrace policies that “are not easily framed as driven by a desire to aid employers or ‘the rich.’” \n \n Two policies former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor promoted as a way to make inroads with middle-class women and families — charter schools and flexible work schedules — were actually the least popular policies among female voters. \n \n Republicans have long had a troubled relationship with female voters, but this report, which comes out just months before Election Day, is the most recent detailed illustration of the problem. Republicans have several initiatives to attract female candidates and voters. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the No. 4 House Republican, for example, is spearheading her chamber’s effort. The Republican National Committee is trying to engage women in 25 “targeted counties for the midterm election,” a spokesman said.', 'Sen.

On another occasion, she writes, after she dropped 50 lbs. one of her fellow Senate members approached her, squeezed her stomach, and said, ""Don\'t lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby!""Gillibrand isn\'t especially offended by her coworkers\' remarks. ""It was all statements that were being made by men who were well into their 60s, 70s or 80s,"" she says.

Kirsten Gillibrand has a new book, Off the Sidelines, out next month, and it takes a frank look at the reality of being a woman on Capitol Hill. Among the more surprising and perhaps not-so-surprising tidbits: Gillibrand reveals she had lost 50 pounds after giving birth when a male senator squeezed her waist from behind. ""Don't lose too much weight now,"" he said. ""I like my girls chubby."" The Washington Post notes that Gillibrand says ""he was one of her favorite senators(!)."" People picks up another quote from a male colleague, handed out while Gillibrand was exercising at the congressional gym: ""Good thing you're working out, because you wouldn't want to get porky!"" Talking Points Memo notes Gillibrand's acerbic response in the book: ""Thanks, a--hole!"" A Southern congressman even told her once, ""You know, Kirsten, you’re even pretty when you're fat,"" Gillibrand wrote, per the New York Post. ""I believed his intentions were sweet, even if he was being an idiot."" Perhaps all the sexist idiocy helped her bond with Hillary Clinton. ""I will help Hillary get elected,"" she told People while promoting the book. ""In my mind, she's definitely running"" in 2016, Gillibrand adds. ""Anytime I've ever talked to her, I've offered every bit of help in the world and she's never said no."" In other way-out-of-date-politician news: A report from two Republican groups finds 49% of female voters view the GOP ""unfavorably,"" including as ""intolerant,"" ""lacking in compassion,"" and ""stuck in the past."" That isn't likely to help the party if Clinton does indeed decide to run, Politico notes."

"['Scientists have long wanted to produce sperm and eggs in the laboratory to not only better understand this fundamental reproductive process but also to discover new ways of helping infertile couples conceive. Using embryonic stem (ES) cells, which in theory can produce all of the body\'s cell types, several teams made some progress in the past few years but were unable to produce viable sperm or eggs. Now a Kyoto University group has found a way to turn mouse ES cells into sperm precursor cells and to use the resulting sperm to produce normal mouse pups. Such research may eventually lead to treatments for human male infertility. But that will require resolving several ""very difficult"" technical and ethical issues, says stem cell biologist Mitinori Saitou, leader of the Kyoto team. \n \n Sperm and eggs develop from what are known as primordial germ cells. These germ cells are produced in early stage embryos in a mass of cells called the epiblast. Several years ago, researchers learned how to take epiblast cells from a mouse embryo and create epiblast stem cells that could regenerate in a dish for long periods of time. Researchers hoped that these epiblast stem cells could be used to produce primordial germ cells and ultimately fertile sperm and eggs. But despite years of attempts, no one succeeded. The Kyoto group concluded that when the lab-created epiblast stem cells gained their ability to grow in dishes, they may have lost their ability to form germ cells. \n \n So taking a different approach, the scientists cultured mouse ES cells in cocktails of growth factors and proteins to produce epliblast-like cells that they could keep alive only for several days. They found that they could use 2-day-old cells to generate primordial germ cell-like cells. When injected into the testes of mice unable to produce their own sperm, these primordial germ cells matured into sperm that were able to fertilize eggs in vitro. The researchers implanted the resulting embryos into surrogate mothers, which produced normal offspring. Those mice then produced their own offspring. Saitou and his colleagues report their work online today in Cell. \n \n ""All I can say is wow! It is a breakthrough,"" says Orly Lacham-Kaplan, a reproductive biologist at Monash University in Australia. The work provides evidence ""that ES cell-derived primordial germ cells can generate functional germ cells,"" says Amander Clark, a stem cell biologist at University of California, Los Angeles, who calls the work ""a critical advance to our basic understanding of the principles of germ cell development."" \n \n Saitou says that there are many hurdles to clear. They would like to learn how to develop sperm completely in the laboratory instead of injecting primordial germ cell-like cells into the testes for maturation. They also want to generate eggs in vitro, both to understand the process and to ultimately try to help infertile women. Saitou also says that extending the work to the clinic will require determining if the same recipe they figured out for mouse cells works for human cells as well.']",1,"– Researchers have managed to produce sperm cells from embryonic stem cells—and for the first time, the sperm worked, resulting in healthy baby mice. Researchers in Japan mixed the embryonic stem cells with certain proteins and hormones. They converted the resulting cells into germ cells, which they implanted in the testes of mice. There, they developed into working sperm, Discover reports. Researchers hope the discovery will lead to male infertility treatments, notes ScienceNow. Scientists had previously created sperm-like cells, but they didn’t function. Though the experiment was a success, “very difficult” issues remain—both physical and ethical, says a researcher. For one thing, the scientists would like to generate the sperm cells in the lab, without having to involve the mice at all. They hope to generate eggs, too. But questions remain over whether the process used for mice will work on humans."
"['Let the songwriting begin. \n \n After an intense couple months of dating, Taylor Swift and Conor Kennedy have broken up, a close friend of the singer-songwriter confirms exclusively to Us Weekly. \n \n PHOTOS: Taylor\'s fashion tribute to Jackie Kennedy Onassis \n \n ""They quietly parted ways a while ago,"" the friend explains of the ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" crooner, 22, and the high school senior, 18. ""It was just a distance thing. No hard feelings. They\'re fine."" \n \n PHOTOS: Taylor\'s romantic history \n \n First spotted with the six-time Grammy winner at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannisport, MA in July, Conor is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the late Mary Kennedy. \n \n But despite Swift\'s speedy summertime bond with her new man and his brood, the romance had to take a backseat to Swift\'s work duties. (Her new album, Red, was just released this week with record-breaking sales and widespread critical acclaim.) \n \n PHOTOS: Taylor\'s red carpet evolution \n \n ""It\'s been over a month since they\'ve even seen each other,"" the friend explains.

Download the Us Weekly iPhone app now!', 'Happy Taylor Swift Release Day! Have you already spent hours hunched over Red’s liner notes in an attempt to decode the messages hidden therein via Swift’s patented code: capital letters sprinkled throughout the lyrics of each song that spell out a clue? You are not alone in this guessing game. So, as is tradition whenever Swift drops a new album, Vulture now presents our best guesses as to who, exactly, Taylor Swift is singing about on each and every one of her new songs. If your name is Jake Gyllenhaal, you might just want to close the tab right now. \n \n 1. “State of Grace” \n \n Hidden Message: LOVE DOESN’T COUNT AFTER GOOD-BYE \n \n One of the main characters on Red is an ex-boyfriend who just would not leave poor Taylor Swift alone (he’ll pop up again on “All Too Well,” “I Almost Do,” and, of course, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”). Now, several of Taylor’s ex-boyfriends could be drunk-texting her at all hours of the night proclaiming their undying love, but it is more fun to assume that she’s talking about the same guy. And that guy, according to the code and the lyrics “twin fire signs and four blue eyes,” would be Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake’s birthday? December 19. Taylor’s birthday? December 13. That makes them both Sagittariuses, which is, of course, one of the three fire signs (read your Susan Miller.) Please remember this fact, because it will be important when we get to … \n \n \n \n 2. “Red” \n \n Hidden Message: SAG \n \n Could SAG stand for “Sagittarius?” Why, yes! Other possible interpretations: Screen Actor’s Guild, to which Jake Gyllenhaal definitely belongs; Sag Harbor, which seems like a place you would see Jake Gyllenhaal (John Mayer is more East Hamptons material); or “SAG” like sag wagon, which is apparently a cycling term and is therefore surely related to these photos of Jake Gyllenhaal in bike shorts. Anyway, it’s Jake. \n \n \n \n 3. “Treacherous” \n \n Hidden Message: WON’T STOP UNTIL IT’S OVER \n \n Not to spoil the later songs, but Conor Kennedy definitely gets a mention — and so we will assume that the lyrics “I will follow you home” are about how Taylor Swift literally followed Conor to his family’s Hyannis Port compound and then bought a home there. Also, “this slope is treacherous” could be about the beach path; Cape Cod is a little rocky. \n \n 4. “I Knew You Were Trouble” \n \n Hidden Message: WHEN YOU SAW ME DANCING \n \n Yeah, we have no idea who Taylor Swift goes clubbing (or wub-wubbing) with, so Vulture chooses to believe that the aforementioned dancing happened after Swift’s single reported date with One Direction heartthrob and noted womanizer Harry Styles. Then he went to Australia and made out with another girl, thus fulfilling the “you never loved me or her or anyone” portion of the lyrics. \n \n \n \n 5. “All Too Well” \n \n Hidden Message: MAPLE LATTES \n \n As Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan points out, “Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal Share Thanksgiving Maple Lattes” is the third result when you Google “maple lattes.” (The song is also just brutally specific, with references to hanging out at Maggie’s house and plaid days and the trip upstate when they went apple-picking. Advantage Swift.) \n \n 6. “22” \n \n Hidden Message: ASHLEY DIANNA CLAIRE SELENA \n \n GREENE AGRON CALLAWAY GOMEZ. Friendship! \n \n 7. “I Almost Do” \n \n Hidden Message: WROTE THIS INSTEAD OF CALLING \n \n “Each time you reach out, there’s no reply.” Smart money’s on Gyllenhaal. \n \n \n \n 8. “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” \n \n Hidden Message: WHEN I STOPPED CARING WHAT YOU THOUGHT \n \n This makes a nice before/after with “I Almost Do,” so: Jake Gyllenhaal, you are officially the indie music snob. \n \n \n \n 9. “Stay Stay Stay” \n \n Hidden Message: DAYDREAMING ABOUT REAL LOVE \n \n This song is about a happy relationship, so it’s either Conor, or — based on the code — an imaginary boyfriend whom we will choose to believe is Ryan Gosling. Since paparazzi have not successfully snapped Conor Kennedy “carrying groceries,” Vulture’s gonna go with Ryan Gosling. (Related: The lyrics “Before you, I only dated self-indulgent takers/ who took all of their problems out on me. But you carry my groceries, and now I’m always laughing” are just the Taylor Swift–iest lyrics of all time.) \n \n \n \n 10. “The Last Time” \n \n Hidden Message: L.A. ON YOUR BREAK \n \n Who takes breaks? Actors take breaks from movies (Gyllenhaal, Taylor Lautner); musicians take breaks from tours or recording (Mayer); high-schoolers take breaks from Deerfield. But since L.A. does not really seem like a Kennedy vacation spot, this one goes in the Gyllenhaal column because of the protracted breakup references. \n \n \n \n 11. “Holy Ground” \n \n Hidden Message: WHEN YOU CAME TO THE SHOW IN S.D. \n \n Old-school ex Joe Jonas was spotted at Taylor Swift concerts in L.A. and San Jose, California. Is it then possible that he also attended a show in San Diego? Yes. More important: Is it possible that Taylor Swift could resist the opportunity to sing about her ex-boyfriend making a grand gesture? No. \n \n \n \n 12. “Sad Beautiful Tragic” \n \n Hidden Message: WHILE YOU WERE ON A TRAIN \n \n John Mayer seems like the kind of guy who would find it more romantic to travel by train, right? Also: John Mayer toured with Train — the band — in 2010. And “we both wake in lonely beds, and different cities” certainly sounds like a description of touring musicians. We’re giving it to Mayer. UPDATE: Commenter JJGrey informs us that Gyllenhaal “joined Mumford and Sons and Old Crow Medicine Show on their Railroad Revival Tour, literally on a train.” We were wrong, and we apologize for not being up on our Mumford trivia. \n \n \n \n 13. “The Lucky One” \n \n Hidden Message: WOULDN’T YOU LIKE TO KNOW \n \n Yes, we would like to know if and when the Joni Mitchell biopic is happening. (We are already pretty sure the song is about her.) \n \n \n \n 14. “Everything Has Changed” \n \n Hidden Message: HYIANNIS PORT \n \n This is a no-brainer — it’s Conor Kennedy! — but please look closely at the lyric sheet below. Following the caps-lock code, it would appear that she misspelled Hyannis Port? Or maybe that is how the homeowners spell it? \n \n \n \n 15. “Starlight” \n \n Hidden Message: FOR ETHEL \n \n In case you were not already aware that Taylor Swift and Ethel Kennedy are best friends. Why doesn’t this song mention “dragging”? \n \n \n \n 16. “Begin Again” \n \n Hidden Message: I WEAR HEELS NOW \n \n Just check the height on these maple latte photos — only a dude who just barely meets Taylor’s height would object to her wearing heels. Jake Gyllenhaal, who knew you were so cruel?']",2,"– Prepare to spend your Thursday evening sobbing into a bowl of Rocky Road, because we are here to tell you that the epic Taylor Swift-Conor Kennedy romance has come to an end. Perhaps because she was cheating on him with his cousin? Not so; a friend insists to Us that ""it was just a distance thing. No hard feelings."" And it happened ""a while ago""—they haven't seen each other in more than a month—which is kinda sad, considering rumors of their relationship cropped up not even three months ago. Even so, the relationship apparently lasted long enough for Taylor to form such a strong bond with Ethel Kennedy that Taylor dedicated a song to Ethel on her new album."
"['Updated 6.15pm \n \n THE DÁIL IS to sit late tonight to pass emergency legislation in order to reclassify certain drugs, including ecstasy and magic mushrooms, as illegal following a court ruling this morning which has temporarily made them legal. \n \n A ruling in the Court of Appeal on the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 this morning effectively means that the possession of certain drugs, which had been illegal, is currently legal. \n \n The court ruling found that the 1977 Act was being added to via ministerial order without recourse to the Oireachtas, in violation of article 15 of the Constitution. \n \n Ministerial orders had been used nine times since the Act’s inception to outlaw the possession of drugs like ecstasy, ketamine, magic mushrooms, benzos and other drugs. \n \n Speaking to reporters today, Health Minister Leo Varadkar explained: “It is still the case that the sale, supply, export or import of such substances remains illegal, even now today.” \n \n The ruling could impact on a small number of current court cases that are being prosecuted under the 1977 Act. It will not impact on existing convictions under the Act. \n \n The ruling means that TDs must pass emergency legislation tonight in order to make these drugs illegal again. The bill will then go to the Seanad tomorrow. \n \n The new bill includes a provision that says it can only take effect on the day after it’s signed into law, meaning that the law will not come into force until 12am on Thursday. \n \n It’s understood that party whips were informed of the potential need for emergency legislation last week but were told it was “highly confidential” until the court ruling was handed down. \n \n The need for emergency legislation means that Sinn Fein’s private members’ bill, which calls for emigrants to be allowed vote in presidential elections, has been postponed to tomorrow evening between 6.30pm and 9.30pm. \n \n It’s now understood that the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill will be taken in the Dáil by Health Minister between 8pm and 11pm tonight. \n \n First published 12.08pm', 'Minister for Health Leo Varadkar has confirmed the Government is to rush through emergency legislation to ban the possession of certain drugs. \n \n Speaking to reporters at Leinster House on Tuesday, he confirmed the drugs included ecstasy, CAT, “magic mushrooms” and substances commonly known as head shop drugs. \n \n “My objective as Minister for Health is to protect public health and that’s why we are going to bring this emergency legislation to ban possession of these substances,” Mr Varadkar said. \n \n He stressed the sale, supply, import and export of the drugs remained illegal. \n \n Possession is technically legal, albeit temporarily, until the emergency legislation is passed, although it remains illegal to purchase the substances. \n \n Mr Varadkar said an appeal to the Supreme Court was under consideration by the Government, but a situation whereby nothing was done immediately could not be allowed. \n \n Referring to the drugs, he said: “They all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits.” \n \n The decision to rush through emergency legislation came after a court struck down the laws banning certain drugs. \n \n In what the Court of Appeal said was a “constitutional issue of far-reaching importance”, the three-judge court unanimously said a regulation making the possession of methylethcathinone illegal was invalid. It is also known as 4-Mec or Snow Blow. \n \n An explanatory memorandum issued by the Department of Health said that as a result of the judgment, “all substances controlled by means of Government Orders made under section 2(2) cease to be controlled with immediate effect, and their possession ceases to be an offence. These include ecstasy, benzodiazepines and new psychoactive substances, so-called ‘headshop drugs’. \n \n It said the judgment had “no implications” for approximately 125 substances, including cannabis, heroin and cocaine. \n \n Stanislav Bederev Judgment \n \n Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015 \n \n In a statement, the Department said: “There is always a degree of uncertainty about the outcome of court cases. The outcome of this case does not affect existing laws regarding the supply, possession or sale of older drugs such as heroin, cocaine or cannabis. \n \n “It does affect the possession of certain newer psychoactive substances which have been added to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by successive governments. However, we are advised that sale and supply of psychoactive substances remains an offence under existing legislation. \n \n “The State successfully defended the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 in the original High Court hearing in March 2014. The matter was appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Government made preparations for a possible negative outcome. \n \n “This included the preparation of emergency legislation to be drafted in the event of a negative outcome for the State. It is now important from both a public health and criminal justice perspective that the legislation be enacted as soon as possible.” \n \n Mr Varadkar will introduce the legislation in the Dáil later on Tuesday and the intention is that it will pass through all stages in the Dáil and Seanad within 24 hours, the statement added. \n \n The court said earlier that Section 2(2) of the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act, under which the regulation was brought in, was unconstitutional because it purports to vest in the Government law-making powers which are in the exclusive authority of the Oireachtas. \n \n The case concerned a prosecution of a man for possession of methylethcathinone which was among a number of substances put on the controlled drugs list in 2010. \n \n Stanislav Bederev, who is denying criminal charges of having the substance for supply in 2012, brought a High Court challenge seeking to stop his trial claiming the regulations were unconstitutional. \n \n Lawyers for Lithuanian-born Mr Bederev argued it was not lawful to put this substance on the controlled drug list because there are no principles and policies guiding the introduction of such rules. \n \n In particular, it was argued by his counsel Sunniva McDonagh, the decision to ban a particular drug was a matter to be considered by the Oireachtas before the relevant government minister could formally initiate the ban. \n \n Not to do so was an “abdication of the role of the Oireachtas” and an impermissible delegation of unfettered power where there were no guiding principles for doing so, it was claimed. \n \n Possession \n \n Mr Bederev had possessed something legal one day and the next was facing a possible prison sentence for something now illegal, it was argued. His trial before Blanchardstown District Court was on hold pending the legal challenge. \n \n The State opposed his application. \n \n Last May, the High Court rejected his challenge saying Section 2.2 of the 1977 Act cannot be read in isolation and must be read in the overall context and purpose of the Act which is to protect individuals and society from the misuse of certain harmful substances. \n \n The Oireachtas may not always be equipped or able to react with sufficient speed to deal with the emergence of new substances and misuse patterns, Mr Justice Paul Gilligan said in his High Court decision. \n \n On behalf of the Court of Appeal, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan said given what had been done in relation to this substance, it might also be asked whether it would be open to the Government to employ the same law to ban other types of drugs which are in everyday use and which are potentially harmful and liable to be misused such as alcohol and tobacco. \n \n Given the breadth of Section 2(2) of the 1977 Act, the Government is “more or less at large in determining which substances or products should be declared controlled drugs”. \n \n In the Bederev case, the judge said, the fundamental choice which remains with the Government, for the purposes of the 1977 Act, “is which dangerous or harmful drugs are liable to misuse such that they should be declared controlled drugs”. \n \n The use of terms such as “misuse”, “dangerous” and “harmful” in the title of the 1977 Act “represent laudable and desirable objectives. \n \n However, they do not in themselves constitute a sufficient restriction on the more or less unlimited power of regulation vested in the Government by Section 2(2) of the Act in relation to what substances should be declared controlled drugs, the judge said. \n \n The conclusion that this section of the Act purports to vest in the Government what, in the absence of appropriate principles and policies in the legislation itself, “are in truth law-making policies is accordingly unavoidable”.', 'The Minister for Health says dozens of people found guilty of drugs offences could now have their convictions overturned - and warned the supply, sale, import and export of ecstasy and other drugs remains illegal. \n \n Leo Varadkar is to bring an emergency bill before the Dáil tonight to restore the ban on drugs like ecstasy and ketamine. \n \n The ban on possession of over 100 drugs was overturned this morning when the Court of Appeal ruled the relevant law to be unconstitutional. \n \n Leo Varadkar, however, said the sale, supply and import of the drugs is still illegal, and only a small number of convictions could now be appealed. \n \n ""I\'m told it\'s dozens, but I can\'t say for certain because what they\'ll have to do now is go thought each individual case and see if the people ion question were charged just under this section of the act, or if they were charged with other acts as well."" \n \n Varadkar is to rush legislation through the Dáil and Seanad over the next few days to deal with possession of ecstasy, ketamine and benzodiazepines. \n \n Emergency legislation will go through the Dáil tonight and the Seanad tomorrow and be sent to the President for signature to restore the ban by Thursday on possession of the drugs. \n \n A statement released by the Department of Health, said there was ""always a degree of uncertainty about the outcome of court cases."" \n \n ""The outcome of this case does not affect existing laws regarding the supply, possession or sale of older drugs such as heroin, cocaine or cannabis. It does affect the possession of certain newer psychoactive substances."" \n \n “We had no way of knowing what the Court would decide today, but we prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet. The emergency legislation I am introducing today will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment,” Minister Varadkar said.']",3,"– A court ruling in Ireland has done a strange thing—legalized possession of certain psychoactive drugs such ecstasy, ketamine, and magic mushrooms. But the freedom is expected to last only about a day as lawmakers race to make the drugs illegal again, reports TheJournal.ie. The rush legislation became necessary after an appeals court today declared a 1977 drug law to be unconstitutional, though the ruling didn't affect older drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, reports the Irish Examiner. Lawmakers knew the decision was potentially looming and had legislation prepared in advance, but it will take about 24 hours to get it in place. ""All substances controlled by means of Government Orders made under section 2(2) cease to be controlled with immediate effect, and their possession ceases to be an offense,"" says Ireland's Department of Health, as per the Irish Times. ""These include ecstasy, benzodiazepines, and new psychoactive substances, so-called 'headshop drugs.'"" While the loophole will be quickly fixed, the court's decision means that ""dozens"" of previous convictions have been called into question, says the nation's top health official. They'll have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis."

"['Florida’s highest-ranking government officials are increasing the pressure on state police to get involved in the counting of ballots in heavily Democratic South Florida as Gov. Rick Scott clings to a lead over Bill Nelson during a statewide recount of their nationally relevant U.S. Senate contest. \n \n Attorneys for Scott’s campaign filed emergency motions Sunday requesting that embattled elections supervisors in Palm Beach and Broward counties turn over custody of their vote-tabulation machines and ballots to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and sheriff’s deputies during times when votes aren’t being counted. The motions come days after Scott claimed that “unethical liberals” in the two counties were trying to steal his election after late-developing returns narrowed his margins over Nelson and forced him into an ongoing statewide recount. \n \n Premium content for only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. SUBSCRIBE NOW \n \n Also on Sunday, Attorney General Pam Bondi told FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen in a letter that she was “deeply troubled” by his agency’s decision to decline Scott’s press conference request to investigate elections fraud in the two counties and urged him to reconsider. \n \n Scott has presented no evidence to back up his fraud allegations, and the Department of State has said its elections monitors have uncovered no criminal behavior. But amid a high-stakes battle over each of the 8.3 million votes cast in Tuesday’s midterms, Scott’s campaign is continuing to lean hard on the elections process in a densely populated area of the state that could make or break his 12,562-vote lead. \n \n Letter+to+Swearingen by Dave Wilson on Scribd \n \n “As long as the Supervisor of Elections has unsupervised, unaccountable, and unfettered access to the ballot boxes, she will be able to destroy evidence of any errors, accidents, or unlawful conduct — making it nearly impossible for an aggrieved party to prosecute their claims or discover later what has actually occurred in the electoral process,” attorney Jason Zimmerman wrote in the complaint filed against Broward Supervisor or Elections Brenda Snipes. \n \n SHARE COPY LINK Broward Circuit Judge Carol-Lisa Phillips also held that Brenda Snipes, Broward’s supervisor of elections, was in violation of Florida public-records laws for not turning over the records requested by Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign for U.S. Senate. \n \n Democrats, who’ve accused Scott and Republican attorneys of voter suppression, reacted harshly. Mark Herron, an election lawyer who represented Al Gore in the 2000 presidential recount, called Scott’s push to involve state police an “abuse of power.” Joe Geller, a Miami state representative and election lawyer called it an “extraordinary” and unwarranted request, although courts in New York recently ordered ballots impounded in a congressional race at the request of Democratic frontrunner Anthony Brindisi. \n \n Letter+to+Detzner by on Scribd \n \n Scott’s campaigns filed the lawsuits — including a third that seeks to invalidate any ballots counted in Broward after Saturday’s deadline to submit unofficial results — as elections departments around the state hustled Sunday to try and meet a 3 p.m. Thursday deadline to recount the ballots cast during the state’s midterm elections. Recounts were also ordered in contests for governor and commissioner of agriculture due to a state law that requires a machine recount for any statewide election decided by a half of a percentage point or less. \n \n Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, left, and Republican Gov. Rick Scott. \n \n Starting Saturday, Miami-Dade had employees working 24 hours a day to finish the process. Broward and Palm Beach have struggled. Machine troubles delayed the start of Broward’s recount operations until late Sunday morning. The Palm Beach Post reported that Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher warned this weekend that Thursday’s deadline will be “impossible” to meet, presenting the possibility that her unofficial results provided to the state on Saturday will stand. \n \n Interjecting state and local police into the mix could complicate the timeline. \n \n “In suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,” said Florida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Peñalosa in an emailed statement Sunday evening. “The governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.” \n \n But missteps by Bucher and Snipes, at the very least, have opened the door to warranted skepticism. \n \n Scott last week won court orders from judges in both counties after he alleged in lawsuits that Bucher was improperly conducting activities involving ballots in private that should have been performed in front of the canvassing board, the body responsible for overseeing the ballot-counting process and ruling on ballots of questionable validity. \n \n Snipes, who has been repeatedly slapped by judges over gaffes in recent years, was ordered by a judge to provide information related to uncounted ballots and issues after she repeatedly declined to provide basic details about her operations to the press or the candidates. \n \n Snipes’ staff also managed to mix up 22 invalid provisional ballots with 183 valid ones this week, and included the votes deemed illegitimate by the Broward County canvassing board in her unofficial vote total to the state. In a conference call with reporters, Tim Cerio, an elections attorney representing Scott in South Florida, noted that the only reasons the problematic ballots were discovered in the first place is because attorneys observing the canvassing board demanded that Snipes present the ballots to the board. \n \n “We’re going to stand up to those who would violate the law and particularly those with a rampant history of voter fraud,” said U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the Republican Senate campaign committee. \n \n The recounted vote tallies in South Florida could prove crucial in the ongoing recounts. Once recounted vote tallies are submitted to the state Thursday, any races still within one quarter of 1 percent will be subject to an automatic hand recount, during which so-called “under-votes” and “over-votes” — ballots in which voters chose too few or too many candidates — will be reviewed ballot by ballot by canvassing boards. \n \n While former congressman Ron DeSantis is far enough ahead of Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum that a hand recount is unlikely to occur in the race for governor, Scott and Nelson are expecting to continue fighting on into the weekend. Hand recount tallies would be due by Nov. 18. And South Florida, a heavily Democratic region of the state, contains more than 35,000 ballots that are considered under-votes in the Senate race. Nelson’s campaign is also fighting to include ballots rejected over signature mismatches in voting totals. \n \n With so much attention paid to Broward County, protesters have been virtually camped outside Snipes’ Lauderhill office for three days. An angry crowd shouted down Florida Sen. Perry Thurston and Florida Democratic Party attorney Mitchell Berger when they appeared in a make-shift “free speech zone” designated in the parking lot outside to address the media Sunday afternoon. \n \n “Everyone wants these votes counted,” Berger said, arguing that hundreds of mail-in ballots were caught up in an Opa-locka mail center and not counted due to a federal investigation of the Aventura man who sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to Democrats around the state. \n \n \n \n \n \n “Fake news,” someone shouted. “More Democratic lies,” another yelled. \n \n \n \n \n \n Berger said he and a Republican counterpart, lawyer William Scherer representing Scott’s senate campaign, both observed the recount process Sunday morning and decided it was all above board. “We both agree there’s no fraud going on,” he said, to jeers and laughter. \n \n Inside Snipes’ headquarters, Eugene Pettis, attorney for Broward’s Supervisor of Elections office, said there will be a hearing in front of a judge sometime Monday to discuss the issue of ballot and voting machine custody. \n \n “They have control here,” Pettis said, referring to the law enforcement officers watching the process and the elections monitors watching the process for the last few weeks. \n \n Scott on Sunday seemed to soften his allegations of fraud after he was criticized when he asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate Snipes and Bucher. That criticism grew in volume when the FDLE declined to investigate, saying it had received no formal request from Scott or evidence of fraud. State elections monitors in Broward County also reported that they had reported no evidence of criminal behavior. \n \n But Republicans remain concerned, and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday wrote a letter urging the head of FDLE to investigate Snipes and Bucher. \n \n “I am deeply troubled by our announcement that you will not pursue any investigation or inquiry into clearly documented irregularities in the conduct of election officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties in the 2018 elections,” Bondi wrote to FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen. \n \n Snipes remains adamant that she has done nothing wrong, and defiant in the face of criticism. Critics also note that Scott could have sought to remove her from office during his eight years as governor over the litany of issues with her office cited in his recent lawsuits. \n \n Ironically, another embattled elected Broward Democrat — Sheriff Scott Israel — would have oversight of ballots if the Scott campaign gets its way. \n \n Supervisors have until Thursday to submit machine recount totals. Under Florida law, any hand recount totals would be due Nov. 18. Final results are to be certified on Nov. 20 by Florida’s Elections Canvassing Commission. The board consists of two members of the Florida Cabinet — and Gov. Rick Scott. \n \n This article has been updated to note that ballots have been impounded in the race for the 22nd congressional district of New York. \n \n Miami Herald reporters Glenn Garvin, Maya Kaufman and Carli Teproff contributed to this report.', 'Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, left, and judge Betsy Benson of the election canvassing board, listen to arguments, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office... (Associated Press) \n \n Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, left, and judge Betsy Benson of the election canvassing board, listen to arguments, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Fla. (Joe Cavaretta /South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) (Associated Press) \n \n FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Mishaps, protests and litigation are overshadowing the vote recount in Florida\'s pivotal races for governor and Senate, reviving memories of the 2000 presidential fiasco in the premier political battleground state. \n \n All 67 counties are facing a state-ordered deadline of Thursday to complete their recounts and half already had begun. Many other counties were expected to begin the work Monday after a weekend of recount drama in Broward and Palm Beach counties, home to large concentrations of Democratic voters. \n \n The developments added up to a tumultuous political day in Florida. More than half of Florida\'s 67 counties began a recount process that\'s unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren\'t aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election. \n \n In Broward County, the recount was delayed for hours Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to slam Broward\'s supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, for ""incompetence and gross mismanagement."" \n \n Broward officials faced further headaches after acknowledging the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all the votes. \n \n Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for Senate, filed suit against Snipes. He was seeking a court order for law enforcement agents to impound all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots ""when not in use until such time as any recounts."" The suit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law. \n \n The court didn\'t immediately respond, though the outcry from Democrats was immediate. \n \n Juan Penalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of ""using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy."" \n \n Meanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she didn\'t think her department could meet Thursday\'s deadline to complete that recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there. \n \n The recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, has been continuing without incident. Smaller counties were expected to begin reviews between Monday and Wednesday. \n \n State officials said they weren\'t aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election. The recount process in the two nationally watched midterm races is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. \n \n Unofficial results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the governor\'s contest. In the Senate race, Scott\'s lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. \n \n State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered. \n \n As the recount unfolded, Republicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on. \n \n Scott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by noncitizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer objecting to Palm Beach County\'s rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a noncitizen. \n \n ""He is trying to commit fraud to win this election,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Bill Nelson\'s a sore loser. He\'s been in politics way too long."" \n \n Nelson\'s campaign issued a statement later saying their lawyer wasn\'t authorized to object to the ballot\'s rejection as ""Non-citizens cannot vote in US elections."" \n \n In Fort Lauderdale, Gillum appeared at a predominantly African-American church Sunday evening, warning against vote suppression and declaring voter disenfranchisement isn\'t just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots with mismatched signatures that ""a volunteer may have the option of ... deciding that vote is null and void."" \n \n Gillum and Nelson have argued each vote should be counted and the process should take its course. \n \n Both the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud. \n \n That didn\'t stop protests outside Snipes\' office, where a crowd of mostly Republicans gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting ""lock her up,"" referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot and many members of a Bikers For Trump group wore matching shirts, mingling among a crowd that included a protester wearing a Hillary Clinton mask. \n \n Registered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old Pompano Beach retail worker, carried a sign reading, ""I\'m not here for Trump! I\'m here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!"" He said the office\'s problems ""don\'t make me feel very much like my vote counted."" \n \n Florida is also conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida\'s three Cabinet seats. \n \n For some, the recounts bring back memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency. \n \n Much has changed since then. \n \n In 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards — voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn\'t fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians. \n \n Now the state requires all Florida counties to use ballots where voters use a pen to mark their candidate\'s name, much like a student taking a multiple-choice test. And how counts proceed is now clearly spelled out. \n \n ___ \n \n AP writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n For AP\'s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics']",2,"– With an unprecedented double recount underway in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott is fighting to get state police involved. The Republican governor—who is clinging to a slim lead in his Senate race with Democratic rival Bill Nelson—filed lawsuits Sunday calling for elections officials in Palm Beach and Broward counties to turn ballots, voting machines, and vote-counting machines over to law enforcement at times when votes aren't being counted, reports Reuters. Scott has claimed that ""unethical liberals"" in the two heavily Democratic counties are trying to steal the election, in which he currently has a lead of just 12,562 votes over Nelson, the Miami Herald reports. One of Scott's lawsuits warned that Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes could ""destroy evidence of any errors, accidents, or unlawful conduct"" if she had ""unsupervised, unaccountable, and unfettered access to the ballot boxes."" Florida Democrats reacted angrily, calling the move to involve police an ""abuse of power,"" the Herald reports. State police and election officials say they have found no evidence of fraud, though protesters, some of them holding pro-Trump signs or chanting ""Lock her up,"" still gathered outside Snipes' office on Sunday, the AP reports. A recount is also happening in the governor's race. (Palm Beach County officials say it will be ""impossible"" to meet the Thursday recount deadline.)"

But we are so excited for ‘Moonlight.’ I think it’s one of the best films of all time. I was also holding my ‘best actress in a leading role’ card that entire time. So whatever story, I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card.” \n \n — There are two sets of cards for every award, so there is the likelihood that Beatty and Dunaway were handed the wrong envelope. Host Jimmy Kimmel had come forward to inform the cast that “Moonlight” had indeed won, showing the inside of the envelope as proof. “I knew I would screw this up,” said Kimmel, a first-time host. (A closeup of the envelope Beatty was holding shows it is indeed labled “Actress in a Leading Role”) \n \n — According to the L.A. Times, Beatty “explained that the reason it had taken him so long to read the card was because he was looking at something that said Emma Stone had won. At that point, he showed it to Dunaway, who announced “La La Land.” Beatty assured viewers that the error was unintentional and he wasn’t trying to turn the biggest award into a joke.” \n \n — It’s not the first time the wrong category winner was an issue at the Oscars. In 1964, Sammy Davis Jr. was handed an envelope for the wrong award, according to ABC News. “Representatives from Oscar’s counting unit at Price Waterhouse had to rush onstage to stop him from blurting out a mistake.

(Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) (Associated Press) \n \n LOS ANGELES (AP) — It was one of the most awkward moments in the history of the Oscars, of television, in entertainment, heck maybe in American history. \n \n And somehow Warren Beatty, Hollywood\'s ultimate smooth leading man, was at the center of it, and the accounting firm that is responsible for the integrity of Oscar voting apologized and was vowing a full investigation. \n \n The producers of ""La La Land"" were nearly done with their acceptance speeches for Best Picture, the Oscar broadcast\'s credits sequence about to roll, when a stir of whispers began on stage. Moments later ""La La Land"" producer Jordan Horowitz returned to the microphone and said ""Moonlight won Best Picture"" and insisting that ""this is not a joke."" \n \n The collective jaw of the crowd at the Dolby Theatre — and of America — remained dropped long after they became convinced it was no joke, but what academy historians later called an apparently unprecedented Oscar error. The accounting firm PwC, formerly Price Waterhouse Coopers, said early Monday that Beatty and Dunaway had been given the wrong envelope. \n \n ""We sincerely apologize to \'Moonlight,\' \'La La Land,\' Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture,"" a statement from the firm said. ""The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred."" \n \n The statement came several hours after the chaotic ending, which featured Beatty returning to the mic to explain that he had opened the envelope and he was confused when it read ""Emma Stone, La La Land."" He had shown it to co-presenter Faye Dunaway briefly, as though he wanted her to read it, which she did, apparently assuming the Emma Stone part was off but the ""La La"" part correct. \n \n ""It\'s one of the strangest things that\'s ever happened to me,"" Beatty said backstage. ""Thank God there were two of us up there,"" Dunaway responded. \n \n The actress then asked Beatty, ""Who else should I tell?"" \n \n ""Everybody,"" he said. \n \n At that point, a security guard tried to take the real envelope and Beatty said, ""Security is not getting this. I\'m giving it to (Moonlight director) Barry Jenkins at a later time."" Beatty also refused to show it to anyone else. \n \n ABC News, tweeting about the ceremony broadcast on its network, said the envelope held by Beatty read, ""Actress in a leading role."" A close-up photo of Beatty onstage verified that. \n \n PwC has counted votes and provides winner envelopes for the Oscars and has done so for more than 80 years. \n \n When the firm\'s representatives realized the mistake, they raced onstage to right it, but too late, officials told The Associated Press. \n \n The result was a bizarre scene with the entire cast of both movies standing together on stage exchanging sympathetic awkward stares and hugs. \n \n The crowd had to rouse itself from its stunned stupor to try to give ""Moonlight"" its just due for winning the big award. And as the credits rolled, usually bringing sweet relief after a long night, people appeared hesitant to leave in their disbelief. \n \n ""It made a very special feeling even more special, but not in the way I expected,"" a bemused Jenkins, co-writer and director of ""Moonlight,"" said backstage. \n \n ""The folks at \'La La Land\' were so gracious,"" he added. ""I can\'t imagine being in their position and having to do that."" \n \n Filmmaker Kenneth Lonergan, who won a best screenplay award for ""Manchester by the Sea,"" cracked wise backstage: ""It turns out that we actually won best picture, which we\'re really happy about,"" he said. \n \n The ceremony\'s chaotic scene immediately raced to the top of all-time Oscar moments, far more stunning than the nude man who raced across the stage in 1974 as part of the ""streaking"" fad. \n \n And it immediately evoked Steve Harvey\'s recent gaffe of naming the wrong Miss Universe winner. \n \n The Miss Universe Twitter account quickly let the Oscars know they felt their pain. \n \n ""Have your people call our people, we know what to do,"" the tweet read. \n \n That was the beginning of a Tweet pile-on that may be the biggest of all time, with many declaring that ""La La Land"" won the popular vote while ""Moonlight"" won the electoral college. \n \n But this stage, and this audience, were far, far bigger and are likely to last far, far longer in collective memory. \n \n ___ \n \n AP writers Lynn Elber, Beth Harris and Lindsey Bahr contributed to this report.', 'How could the wrong film have been named as the winner of the Oscars’ most important award? Here are the pictures that tell the story \n \n Anatomy of an Oscars fiasco: how La La Land was mistakenly announced as best picture \n \n It will go down in Oscars history as the most awkward, embarrassing moment of all time: an extraordinary failure in the Oscars voting procedure.

USA TODAY watched the evening unfold from the wings of the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, where Hollywood insiders soothed nerves and swapped congratulatory hugs. \n \n Let\'s get this party started \n \n Oscars co-producer Jennifer Todd walks past host Jimmy Kimmel\'s dressing room backstage, pointing it out to a group that includes her husband, actor Chris Messina, and Captain Fantastic director/writer Matt Ross. \n \n ""Is he nervous?"" Ross asks. ""He didn\'t seem it,"" Todd says. After a brief tour of the stage, they head out to the red carpet. \n \n Minutes later, Kimmel strolls past in a blue fleece sweatshirt emblazoned with a tiny Oscar statue logo, a backpack strapped on both shoulders. Talking intently, he heads to his dressing room, accompanied by an entourage of writers. \n \n Last-minute rehearsal \n \n A calm Kimmel is in the orchestra pit, working on a skit with two stand-ins for Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. He\'s mock-conducting the orchestra to play them off the stage as Todd watches on a monitor. \n \n ""If you guys like that, I like that,"" Kimmel says happily. ""Break a leg tonight — break multiple legs."" He laughs. ""OK, don\'t literally break anything."" \n \n He returns to his dressing room, beaming and giving good-luck high fives. \n \n The champagne is flowing \n \n Hailee Steinfeld walks past, holding her dress with one hand and swiping photos from the red carpet on her smartphone with the other. ""She looks gorgeous,"" she tells a companion of one shot. \n \n As she waits for an elevator, John Legend walks by with Chrissy Teigen. ""Can we go straight to the green room?"" he asks an attendant. Hand in hand, they pass Michael J. Fox and his wife Tracy Pollan. The sound of champagne corks popping can be heard as they enter. \n \n A cart loaded with gleaming gold Oscars rolls by, accompanied by the sound of drilling as adjustments are made to the set. \n \n Even the Oscar bathroom is icky \n \n Adam Carolla heads into Kimmel\'s dressing room wearing a casual button-down shirt and re-emerges dressed for the show in a tux. \n \n A resplendent Alicia Vikander swans past best supporting actor nominee Lucas Hedges (for Manchester by the Sea) on her way to the green room. Her train is so long that one of two women accompanying her nearly walks on it but pulls back in time, sighing in relief. \n \n But it\'s not all glamour backstage. Dakota Johnson heads into the unisex bathroom with a female friend. \n \n ""Phew!"" says Johnson as she walks out in her beautiful yellow dress, passing by Javier Bardem. ""That is so gnarly. Can we get a candle in here?"" \n \n Meanwhile, Viggo Mortensen (Captain Fantastic) leans against the wall, surveying the scene with a glass of wine and a program for the show in hand. He looks calm. ""Why not?"" the best actor nominee says. ""I have nothing to worry about."" \n \n Lots of love for Meryl \n \n Best actress nominee Meryl Streep (Florence Foster Jenkins) is parked by a wall with her husband, Don Gummer. They\'re having a private conversation as a security guard has the sole job of guiding people away from stepping on her dress. \n \n As they\'re going through the program, Shirley MacLaine comes over to kiss them both. An assistant passes by and asks people to take their seats. The show is about to start. \n \n Streep is people-watching as Matt Damon heads to the green room. Kate McKinnon walks by and calls out, ""You are gorgeous"" to Streep. Faye Dunaway stops by and introduces herself. ""I so admire you,"" Streep tells her. Dunaway summons a photographer to take a picture. ""Send me a copy!"" she says. \n \n As Streeps passes Kimmel\'s dressing room on her way to her seat in the auditorium, the assembled writers burst into applause. She blushes and keeps walking. \n \n \'Best show ever!\' \n \n Justin Timberlake\'s backup band walks by chanting, ""We\'re going to the Oscars! We\'re going to the Oscars!"" \n \n ""Yes, we are going to the Oscars!"" says Janelle Monáe. \n \n Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson joins the entire cast of writers as Kimmel emerges from his dressing room.

Hands shoved in his pockets, Vaughn says, ""Twenty-one times. Twenty-one times, that\'s just crazy."" \n \n ""And I love that he was wearing sneakers like a gentleman. It\'s like, \'After 21 nominations, I\'m going to be wearing sneakers, dammit.\' "" \n \n Viola Davis is ready to get comfy \n \n MacLaine and Charlize Theron are quite the instant friends as they ready to present best foreign language film. Theron is protective of the 82-year-old actress, asking her if she wants to go over the script one more time, and MacLaine repeats the pronunciation of director/writer Asghar Farhadi\'s name (The Salesman). As the two watch the best supporting actress nominees, Theron puts her arm around MacLaine, who remarks, ""She was so good"" when Nicole Kidman is shown for Lion. \n \n When supporting actress winner Viola Davis (Fences) comes backstage, Theron keeps MacLaine out of the way of the crush and is the first to hug Davis, saying, ""Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Seriously, oh, my God."" \n \n After winning her first Oscar, Davis sits deep in the wings as a stylist pulls off her high heels and replaces them with an appropriately red pair of closed-toe shoes with Velcro straps. After Davis stands up, sweeps her dress down to cover the shoes and walks on, one of the show minders remarks, ""That has to be an Oscar first."" \n \n ""She just wants to be comfortable,"" the stylist says. \n \n A \'La La Land\' reunion \n \n Seth Rogen is cooling his heels backstage, wearing a pair of glowing white sneakers for an upcoming Back to the Future skit. He\'s aware that everyone is staring at his feet, especially when a stylist tucks his tuxedo pants into the high tops, causing him to laugh. \n \n During a commercial break, Kimmel hustles back to his dressing room to change. As he walks in, staffers ask, ""Is it OK to clap?"" \n \n ""Too early for that,"" says Kimmel, but he does allow fist bumps. \n \n Heading into the green room, Teigen points out to her husband, ""Your best friend is behind you, John."" Legend looks back and sees his La La Land co-stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. The two men exchange a power handshake. \n \n ""John drops your name any chance he gets,"" Teigen tells Gosling. \n \n When Rogen heads back to his seat, now wearing black shoes, someone asks, ""What happened to the shoes?"" \n \n ""They took them back,"" he says. \n \n #Merylsayshi \n \n Chilling in the wings, Streep laughs as she watches Kimmel make President Trump Twitter jokes. She startles when she hears ""Coming up, Meryl Streep!"" during the commercial break, thinking she\'s missed her cue. \n \n ""What, what?"" she says. ""It has happened before."" Her co-presenter Bardem laughs. ""That was a moment,"" he says. \n \n Afterward, Streep and husband Don stand next to Gosling and Stone to watch Legend\'s City of Stars and Audition (The Fools Who Dream) medley, Don\'s arm around her as she sways back and forth. \n \n When La La Land cinematographer Linus Sandgren wins, Stone stomps her feet and squeals out loud. ""I am so happy. So happy."" She and Gosling run to the wings and are the first to congratulate Sandgren as he comes offstage. \n \n \'Moonlight\' has a moment \n \n After their skit, Damon and Affleck exit the stage and walk over to their producing partner Todd, who is also producing the awards show. ""That killed,"" she tells them. \n \n ""The show\'s going great,"" Affleck says. ""It\'s a little long,"" she says. ""That\'s OK if it\'s long, if everyone\'s loving it,"" Damon says. \n \n Affleck and Damon are the first to greet Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney, best adapted screenplay winners for Moonlight. \n \n ""I\'m feeling really good now,"" Jenkins says, Oscar in hand.

Any hope of a sneak upset was dashed when Faye Dunaway read out the… \n \n Wait. There’s confusion. Hold up a second. The wrong envelope? What? What just happened? What is Warren Beatty trying to explain just happened? Can this possibly be true? \n \n In a last-ditch twist so universally jaw-dropping that M. Night Shyamalan has already – quite genuinely – taken credit for it on Twitter, the actual winner of Best Picture was not La La Land at all. It was Moonlight. \n \n It took an incredible several minutes for this monumental screw-up to be witnessed, addressed and rectified. In this time, the poor La La Land producers had time to thank their agents, their wives, and everyone else in the room while we sat and yawned. Then one of them stepped in with big, urgent news. “This is not a joke,” he was forced to explain. “Moonlight won.” \n \n In came Beatty again. Suddenly it all made sense. He had stared inside the envelope in such bafflement, groping within in case it contained something he couldn’t initially find. It looked like he was horsing around, but he was clearly just confused. He was holding the one that said “Emma Stone, La La Land” inside it. And Faye Dunaway saw the last three words, and fatefully delivered them to the world. \n \n But Moonlight – truly the year’s *best* picture – was the title inside the envelope they should have been given. Moonlight! For it to win in this fashion was an insane coup, a heaven-sent miracle for the movie’s fans. We will pore over this footage for years, scrutinising every detail. The Oscars have never dealt a surprise like this, in 90 years, not once. Narrative drama in any format may have just peaked. And every jaw in Hollywood is still being scraped off the floor.', 'What happened at the Oscars is unprecedented. \n \n The night’s biggest award — Best Picture — was handed to the wrong film, presumed frontrunner La La Land, because presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were given the wrong envelope. It bore the name of La La Land’s Emma Stone, who had won Best Actress moments before. \n \n The three credited producers for La La Land were almost through their triumphant speeches — indeed, the third, Fred Berger, was in the middle of speaking — when producer Jordan Horowitz was forced to take the microphone and say the film had lost to Moonlight. \n \n Report from @JeffreyLAT backstage: Mid @LaLaLand acceptance, stage hand in wings said ""Oh, f-ck. Oh my God. He got the wrong envelope."" — Amy Kaufman (@AmyKinLA) February 27, 2017 \n \n Essentially everybody involved appeared to believe, initially, that it was a joke, from the moment that Beatty — clearly flummoxed by having an envelope that read “Emma Stone” — tried to make sense of what had happened, only to have the crowd (and his co-presenter Dunaway) think he was unnecessarily prolonging the announcement, to the moment when Berger said, “By the way, we lost.” \n \n PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that counts the Oscar ballots, issued a statement taking the blame for the mix-up: \n \n We sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation. \n \n On Monday, it further clarified the situation in another statement: \n \n PwC takes full responsibility for the series of mistakes and breaches of established protocols during last night’s Oscars. PwC Partner Brian Cullinan mistakenly handed the back-up envelope for Actress in a Leading Role instead of the envelope for Best Picture to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner. \n \n Variety has much more on the mix-up. \n \n In the moment, though, it was chaos. It’s never happened in the 89-year history of the Oscars (much less in the biggest category), and it seemingly disproved one of the longest-running Oscar urban legends. \n \n The Oscars have a procedure for what happens if the wrong name is read — but it apparently doesn’t work that well \n \n Only two people know the names of the Oscar winners before the envelopes are opened and read. They’re always two accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the firm that tabulates Oscar votes, and they carry the results in the famed briefcases that make their way down the red carpet every year. \n \n PWC’s methods for tabulation are said to be quite rigorous, with lots of double checks and redundancies built into their system, which is designed to make sure the right winner is placed into every envelope. But the firm’s method for correcting the situation if the wrong envelope is handed to the presenters — as apparently happened with Beatty and Dunaway — is clearly not as foolproof. \n \n As one of those two PWC accountants explains: \n \n I guess Warren and Leo came from opposite sides https://t.co/wOcicSEg5C pic.twitter.com/EUEf1nO2gi — Ev Williams (@ev) February 27, 2017 \n \n Essentially, the PWC accountants say that in the event of a mix-up, they would signal to a stage manager that the wrong name had been read, and the stage manager would then find a way to halt the proceedings on stage. Indeed, this bit of Oscar trivia is so popular as a “what if” that stories are written about it in the press every year — what would happen if the wrong envelope were opened, or a presenter just decided to take matters into their own hands? \n \n “We would make sure that the correct person was known very quickly. Whether that entails stopping the show, us walking onstage, us signaling to the stage manager — that’s really a game-time decision, if something like that were to happen. Again, it’s so unlikely,” Brian Cullinan, one of the two accountants (the other is Martha Ruiz) who knew the winners for this year’s awards, told the Huffington Post mere days ago. \n \n And, granted, the process for announcing the correct winner makes much more sense for, say, Best Actor, where only one person is taking the stage, than it does for Best Picture, where everybody involved in a film swarms to the microphone. But it’s still remarkable that La La Land had all but completed its speeches, and host Jimmy Kimmel was onstage to wrap up the evening before the announcement was made. \n \n Think of everything that had to go wrong here: Not only did the wrong envelope have to be handed to Beatty and Dunaway, but it had to include the name of the one nominee in the Best Actress category who appeared in a film nominated for Best Picture. (Had, say, Natalie Portman won for Jackie, Beatty and Dunaway would have known immediately what had happened.) \n \n And that Best Picture nominee was the season-long frontrunner — with 14 nominations and six other Oscars to its name from earlier in the evening. So when Beatty and Dunaway announced that it had won, no one batted an eye. \n \n But this has never happened in the history of the Oscars. The only time that comes close was in 1964, when Sammy Davis Jr. presented the award for Adaptation or Treatment Score but was handed the envelope for Original Score. And that’s a completely different situation, because the two categories had completely different sets of nominees. \n \n Moonlight won because it smartly ran all season long as the alternative to La La Land \n \n With La La Land’s loss, one thing becomes clear: You don’t want to be the early Oscar frontrunner. For three years in a row, the frontrunner — Boyhood in 2015, The Revenant in 2016, and La La Land in 2017 — has lost on Oscar night. And they’ve lost in three different ways, too: Boyhood faded in the stretch. The Revenant lost in a tight three-way race (to another early frontrunner, Spotlight). And La La Land lost despite being such a big Oscar frontrunner that I said if it lost, it would be the biggest Oscar upset ever. (And it is, only made more so by the ultra-bizarre circumstances around what happened.) \n \n Only 12 Years a Slave, which won in 2014, managed to hold on to its frontrunner status from its September 2013 debut through the February 2014 awards. And it was bolstered by the sense that both Gravity and American Hustle were nipping at its heels. (Indeed, Gravity ended up winning seven awards, including Director, but not Picture, while 12 Years a Slave won a supporting acting prize and the Adapted Screenplay award along with Picture — with the situations for both eerily mirroring the La La Land vs. Moonlight split.) \n \n You have to go all the way back to The Artist in the Oscar season of 2011 and 2012 to find an early frontrunner that essentially cruised through the whole season with nary a speed bump or major competitor. \n \n And the Oscars’ ranked-choice voting system means that even if you’re not the number one choice of a plurality, you can still be the number two or three choice of a lot of people and pull off the win as those voters’ number one choices drop out. (Read more about this here.) And, indeed, in every other category where Moonlight and La La Land faced off — where a simple plurality carries the day — Moonlight lost. (It lost three of those categories — Cinematography, Score, and Director — to La La Land, and both films lost Editing to Hacksaw Ridge.) \n \n In the past, the ranked-choice system has tilted toward movies about show business, consensus choices that appealed to the entertainment industry, but in 2017 it clearly worked in Moonlight’s favor. Why? \n \n Part of this is thanks to a very smart campaign run by the movie’s studio, A24, which essentially spent the entire awards season hanging out in the runner-up slot, never accruing enough momentum to overtake La La Land, but never fading so much that it was out of the running either. And the Academy’s moves toward developing a more diverse membership, bolstered by a large influx of nominees who don’t fit the typical “older, straight white man” Oscar voter mold, could have also worked in Moonlight’s favor. But that outreach didn’t change the makeup over the Oscar voting body overnight. Something else happened. \n \n Talk to Oscar voters and those connected to them in the weeks leading up to the Oscars, and you heard much more passion for La La Land, but Moonlight was the only other film mentioned at all consistently as everything else faded. (Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan has also talked about this phenomenon.) It certainly didn’t hurt that Moonlight had Plan B Productions — better known as Brad Pitt’s production company — in its corner, either. (Indeed, one of Moonlight’s winners is Pitt’s producing partner Dede Gardner, also an Oscar winner for 12 Years a Slave.) \n \n Moonlight also reflects the Academy’s acceptance of both racially diverse and LGBTQ themes — notable in the wake of two straight years without acting nominees of color and the previous most famous Oscar upset of them all, which saw the historic gay romance Brokeback Mountain bested by a largely unpredicted victory by Crash. In a way, Moonlight winning is a symbolic exemplar of the Academy tossing off both of those albatrosses, if only for a single year. \n \n But that’s not the only explanation for Moonlight’s win. Another contributing factor, among many, may be the fact that Donald Trump is president, Hollywood hates that he’s president, and Academy members may have been looking for ways to symbolically push back against his agenda with their votes. Throughout the night, categories kept going to movies that humanized the targets of Trump’s tweets, proposed laws, and vitriol, whether it was the documentary short winner The White Helmets or the Iranian foreign film winner The Salesman. \n \n And what better film to embrace if you want to send a message to the president — symbolically — than a beautiful, aching, artistic drama about a poor, gay black man coming of age? \n \n Oh, right, this also vindicates Marisa Tomei \n \n One of those weirdo bits of Oscar lore — which was even hinted at in Entertainment Weekly and the Hollywood Reporter — is that when announcing the winner of Best Supporting Actress in 1993, Jack Palance read the wrong name. \n \n He read Marisa Tomei of My Cousin Vinny, when it should have been any of the other nominees. The best explanation — Tomei was the only American in a category full of Brits, so her upset was a victory for patriotism and country — paled in comparison to the idea of an old man just making up a winner. \n \n PWC has always insisted this was not the case, that they would have rushed the stage if Palance had actually read the wrong name. But the urban legend persisted because, well, nothing had ever happened to disprove it. \n \n Until now, when the biggest award of the night was announced to go to the wrong film, and everybody still watching the Oscars thought there was a different Best Picture winner for more than a minute, when the procedure asserted itself for the first time in Oscars history. \n \n It was a hell of a way to end the evening, only made more so by the fact that it accidentally vindicates Marisa Tomei after 24 years of whispers about the invalidity of her Oscar. Good for you, Marisa! You, too, are a winner! \n \n Update: Some wording in this piece has been changed to better reflect the confluence of events that led to Moonlight’s Best Picture win. \n \n Update 2: We’ve added a later statement from PricewaterhouseCoopers.', '“Moonlight” walked away with best picture honors at the end of Sunday night’s Oscars ceremony in Hollywood. \n \n The presenters for the final award — Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway — were incorrectly given the best actress award envelope. A confused Beatty saw Emma Stone’s name and “La La Land,” and handed the envelope to Dunaway, who then announced the musical as the Best Picture winner. \n \n The “La La Land” cast took the stage and producers began their speeches. But they stopped midway when they realized their error. \n \n “There’s a mistake. ‘Moonlight’ you guys won best picture,” Jordan Horowitz said to the shocked Dolby Theater audience. “This is not a joke, come up here” the producer added. “Moonlight has won best picture.” \n \n \n \n Beatty then returned to the microphone to explain: “I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, ‘La La Land.’ That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny.” \n \n “Moonlight” beat out “La La Land,” “Hidden Figures,” “Manchester by the Sea,” “Arrival,” “Hacksaw Ridge,” “Hell or High Water,” “Lion,” and “Fences.” \n \n RELATED CONTENT: Every Oscar Best Picture Winner [GALLERY] \n \n It was nothing less than a shock for Barry Jenkins’ intimate study of a black youth coming to terms with his homosexuality to walk away with the win: Damien Chazelle’s “La La Land” had been widely tipped as the frontrunner on the strength of a dominant precursor showing and top prizes from the Golden Globes, the Producers Guild, and the Directors Guild. Notably, though, “Moonlight” scored more best film prizes from critics groups around the country, making it a formidable dark horse every step of the way. \n \n Watch the moment unfold below:', 'The spotlight is now on PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has overseen the Academy\'s ballot-counting process for 83 years. \n \n Was it the Bonnie and Clyde presenter team\'s fault? A case of the envelopes getting mixed up backstage? Let the finger-pointing begin. \n \n After a stunning and surreal mistake that may be the worst Academy Awards telecast flub in history, the accounting firm in charge of the ballot-counting process is clarifying its role. \n \n ""We sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture,"" said PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has overseen the Academy\'s ballot-counting process for 83 years. \n \n The statement added: ""The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation."" \n \n In years past, the firm has provided two sets of winners\' envelopes in briefcases that are sent to the Dolby Theatre, one briefcase for either side of the stage. \n \n In what was was supposed to just be a memorable movie reunion, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway ended up fumbling the presentation of best picture, as they were apparently holding the best actress envelope instead. \n \n Not only did Dunaway read off La La Land as the best picture winner, the confusion wasn\'t fixed until after several members of the Lionsgate movie\'s team had already spoken. ""I opened the envelope and it said \'Emma Stone, La La Land.\' That\'s why I looked at Faye, and at you. I wasn\'t trying to be funny,"" Beatty clarified, laughing nervously. \n \n ""This is very unfortunate, what happened. Personally, I blame Steve Harvey for this,"" emcee Jimmy Kimmel said, trying to salvage the moment with a joke about how Harvey had announced the wrong winner of the ""Miss Universe"" pageant on live TV in 2015. However, this mistake was far worse. \n \n Moonlight director Barry Jenkins appreciated the surreal nature of the moment right away, saying onstage: ""Very clearly, very clearly, even in my dreams, this could not be true. But to hell with dreams, I’m done with it, ’cause this is true. Oh my goodness."" \n \n At the end of the televised portion, Kimmel added one last jab. ""Well, I don’t know what happened. I blame myself for this,"" he said, referencing his self-effacing joke at the top of the show. ""Let’s remember, it’s just an awards show. I mean, we hate to see people disappointed but the good news is, we got to see some extra speeches. We had some great movies. I knew I would screw this show up, I really did."" \n \n La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz had to take a ballot and show the TV audience that, in fact, it said Moonlight. ""I was ecstatic, it was amazing. I thought we won an Oscar,"" Horowitz recalled to The Hollywood Reporter. ""Some guys in headsets started buzzing around. It became clear that was something wrong. They took the envelope I had. It said \'Emma Stone, La La Land\' on it."" \n \n He added: ""It was clear that there was something wrong. We started looking for the best picture envelope. Nobody knew where it was. Then it appeared, they opened it next to me and it said \'Moonlight.\'"" \n \n PwC has had Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz as co-ballot leaders overseeing the process for several years. The company touted that the ballot briefcases had made stops in 11 cities across the U.S. before making its way to Hollywood for the big day. \n \n Backstage, Jenkins was asked to explain the moment. ""No explanation; things just happen,"" he said. ""I will say I saw two cards. I wanted to see the card, and Warren refused to show the card to anybody before he showed it to me. He said, \'Barry Jenkins has to see the card. He needs to know.\'"" \n \n Moonlight breakout star Mahershala Ali, who won in the supporting actor category, was reflective. ""It’s very hard to feel joy in a moment like that,” he said, adding: “I feel very fortunate for all of us to have walked away with the best picture award. It’s pretty remarkable.” \n \n With the top honor yanked away from the frontrunner, La La Land ended the evening with six wins, Moonlight claimed three wins and Hacksaw Ridge and Manchester by the Sea took two awards. \n \n Emma Stone, who claimed best actress, was cordial when asked about the confusion by reporters. ""I f—ing love Moonlight,"" she said. ""Of course it was an amazing thing to hear them say La La Land — we would have loved best picture, but we\'re so happy for Moonlight."" \n \n Meanwhile, at the Governors Ball, Dunaway wasn\'t as gregarious about the moment. The presenter told THR, ""No, I\'m not going to speak about it."" \n \n Rebecca Sun, Mia Galuppo and Scott Feinberg contributed to this article.']",8,"– Bonnie and Clyde appear to be off the hook after the most shocking moment in Oscars history—the blunder that saw La La Land announced as Best Picture, only for Moonlight to be declared the real winner when the former film's producers had almost finished their speeches. Accounting firm PwC, which oversees the ballot-counting, says Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were handed the wrong category envelope. ""We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred,"" the company formerly known as Price Waterhouse Coopers said in a statement to the AP, apologizing to the presenters, both movies, and Oscars viewers for the fiasco. A roundup of coverage: The Guardian has photos showing moment by moment how things went wrong. Beatty can be seen carrying the red envelope for ""Actress in a Leading Role,"" which he opens, then hands to Dunaway. He later said he was confused because it said ""Emma Stone: La La Land."" She reads out the movie title. With the La La Land team on stage, Oscars overseers can be seen examining the envelope. USA Today reports that as the La La Land team went on stage, a PwC accountant backstage shouted ""He took the wrong envelope!"" and ran onstage. ""I was ecstatic, it was amazing. I thought we won an Oscar,"" La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz tells the Hollywood Reporter. But then, ""some guys in headsets started buzzing around. It became clear that something was wrong."" The New York Times has a transcript of the chaotic minutes onstage. ""I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight,"" says Horowitz graciously. La La Land star Ryan Gosling could be seen apparently trying not to laugh during the mix-up, though the BBC's Martha Kearney says he had a ""face like thunder"" while waiting for a limo after the ceremony. This has never happened before in any category in Oscars history, Vox reports in a look at how PwC handles the envelopes—and at its procedure for handling mix-ups. ""It was very quick, I can't talk about it. The card read that way. It was a very odd thing,"" Dunaway tells the Telegraph, adding: ""It wasn't Warren's fault."" La La Land star Stone told the media she was excited for Moonlight, which she considers one of the best movies of all time, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. But she added: ""I was also holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time. So whatever story, I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card."" Variety notes that it was also a shock to many that Moonlight had won Best Picture at all, though it had won more best film prizes from critics groups than La La Land. It turns out there was a second big fail on Sunday night."

"['Sprint Nextel Corp. will begin selling the new version of the Apple iPhone in mid-October, people familiar with the matter said, filling a huge hole in the No. 3 U.S. carrier\'s lineup and giving Apple Inc. another sales channel for its popular gadget. \n \n The timing, however, indicates Apple\'s new iPhone, which is expected to be called iPhone 5, will hit the market later than expected and too late to contribute to sales in Apple\'s fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in September. Most observers had expected the device to arrive next month. \n \n Sprint will get both the new iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4 but it\'s unclear just how many new subscribers Sprint will be able to reel in come this fall, MarketWatch\'s Dan Gallagher reports on Markets Hub. (Photo: AP Photo.) \n \n The deal could help prop up the nation\'s third-largest carrier and give AT&T Inc. more ammunition in its attempt to win regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of No. 4 U.S. carrier T-Mobile USA Inc. \n \n Verizon Wireless and AT&T, the two largest wireless carriers, measured by subscribers, will begin selling the phone in mid-October as well, according to two people familiar with the matter. \n \n Sprint had more than 52 million subscribers at the end of the second quarter, compared with 106 million for Verizon and nearly 99 million for AT&T. \n \n Sprint will begin selling the iPhone 5 in mid-October, closing a huge hole in the No. 3 U.S. carrier\'s lineup and giving Apple another channel for selling its popular phone. Spencer Ante has details on The News Hub. \n \n Landing the iPhone is a big win for Sprint, whose results have suffered without being able to sell the trend-setting device. AT&T has relied on versions of the Apple device to drive sales since 2007. This February, Verizon Wireless began selling the iPhone 4. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC. \n \n In the second quarter, Sprint blamed a decline in its contract subscribers on more pronounced ""competitive headwinds,"" most prominently, ""the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone."" \n \n Sprint will also carry the iPhone 4, starting at the same time, one person familiar with the situation said. \n \n Richard Doherty, director of the research firm Envisioneering Group, said that the addition of the iPhone would help Sprint retain many of its customers itching to upgrade. The iPhone will also increase foot traffic in Sprint stores, which should help the company to sell high-margin iPhone accessories. ""Sprint needs it,"" said Mr. Doherty. ""There are a lot of families that will embrace the iPhone."" \n \n That said, the deal could also hurt Sprint by helping AT&T improve its chances of winning approval from regulators for its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, said Marc Ostrau, a partner and co-chair of the antitrust and unfair competition group at law firm Fenwick & West. \n \n ""It not only is likely to give Sprint a boost but also puts more focus on the increasing importance of device suppliers relative to carriers,"" said Mr. Ostrau. \n \n Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, said a Sprint iPhone would probably help AT&T\'s efforts, but he said the impact depends on how much regulators determine the deal curbs AT&T\'s ability to raise prices without losing too many sales. \n \n ""The question is how much more competition do you get when you have two rivals rather than one,"" said Mr. Hovenkamp. \n \n The cellphone business is increasingly driven by hot smartphones, which are growing more sophisticated and expensive. Apple commanded an average of more than $650 apiece for its iPhones last quarter. Carriers subsidize the difference between that cost and the phone\'s $199 or $299 retail price, hoping to make up the difference with the data plans they sell over the course of two-year contracts customers must sign to get the subsidy. \n \n Apple created additional leverage for itself by signing exclusive deals when it first launched the iPhone in 2007. In recent years, the company has changed strategy, inking deals with multiple carriers in countries around the world. \n \n The new iPhone is expected to be similar to the current iPhone 4, but thinner and lighter with an improved digital camera and a new more sophisticated operating system. \n \n Apple said in June that a new version of its mobile operating system would be available this fall, leading many analysts to conclude that an upgraded iPhone would be introduced at the same time. \n \n On a July earnings conference call, Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said the company\'s September quarter would be affected by ""a future product transition that we are not going to talk about today,"" increasing anticipation. \n \n While Apple unveiled the iPhone 4 at its June developers\' conference last year, its successor wasn\'t ready in time for this year, according to a person briefed on Apple\'s product plans. The company then aimed to launch a new iPhone by the end of September, though two people familiar with the situation previously told The Wall Street Journal that the phone could be delayed again if its contract manufacturer couldn\'t improve its production yield rate. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Sprint, fighting to turn itself around after its disastrous merger with Nextel last decade, has managed to stem subscriber defections and improve customer service.

But it has disappointed investors by failing to add new subscribers more quickly, in part because it competes with rivals that carry Apple\'s fast-selling phone. \n \n Verizon Wireless, which cracked AT&T\'s exclusive U.S. hold on the iPhone this year, has sold 4.5 million of the Apple devices in the first half of 2011. \n \n AT&T, which is also able to sell a cheaper prior version of the iPhone, has sold 7.2 million this year. \n \n —Yukari Iwatani Kane contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Joann S. Lublin at joann.lublin@wsj.com', 'With the iPhone 5 possibly on its way to Sprint Nextel, could the end of its much-loved unlimited-data plan be far behind? \n \n commentary Once Sprint Nextel gets the iPhone, you can bid farewell to its unlimited-data plan. \n \n Sprint CEO Dan Hesse, as seen in one of the company\'s much-played black-and-white television commercials. (Credit: CBS/Sprint) \n \n If history is any indication, Sprint will have to make some tough decisions, if Apple\'s blockbuster device starts weighing on its network. It\'s something the other carriers have done, and it\'s part of a broader trend of telecommunication companies struggling to keep up with growing bandwidth consumption. \n \n After suffering through years of heavy bandwidth usage from iPhone users, AT&T; relented and switched to a tiered pricing plan last year. It only took Verizon Wireless a few months after launching its version of the iPhone 4 before it opted to apply similar data caps. \n \n Sprint, which The Wall Street Journal reported today will be getting the iPhone 5 at the same time as AT&T; and Verizon in October, will likely follow the same path. \n \n I have no first-hand knowledge of Sprint\'s thinking on its successful--but taxing--offer of an all-you-can-eat data plan for its smartphones. A Sprint representative wasn\'t immediately available to answer my questions. \n \n But I do know that networks aren\'t fundamentally different from each other, despite the marketing jargon and hype that surrounds them. Sprint doesn\'t have any more capacity than Verizon and AT&T.; In fact, it may be in a worse position now because its unlimited-data offer is unique in the market, likely attracting the heaviest of users. \n \n The carriers\' switch to tiered plans doesn\'t include existing unlimited-data customers, who have had the option to be grandfathered into an unlimited plan. You can see the strain the grandfathering is putting on the carriers, with both AT&T; and Verizon switching to language in their service agreements that allow them to throttle, or choke off, the connection speed when a user exceeds a certain threshold of data consumption. \n \n Sprint is in a touchy spot because it has positioned itself as the unlimited carrier. Ads talk about the company\'s truly limitless plans, and Chief Executive Dan Hesse has been featured on commercials deriding competitors\' actions such as throttling. \n \n As I\'ve written, Verizon\'s decision to switch to a capped plan has been a boon for Sprint. The carrier is the only remaining company to offer a truly unlimited-data plan, a rare marketing and competitive edge outside of cheaper prices. Even Sprint\'s prepaid arm, Virgin Mobile, has decided to employ throttling. \n \n But all good things have to come to an end. Speaking to a roundtable of bloggers and reporters last month, Hesse acknowledged that data traffic could eventually be an issue. \n \n ""Nothing\'s a guarantee that it\'s forever,"" he said at the time. \n \n For Sprint, the choice is a trade-off: keep the unlimited-data plan and spur additional customer growth, or cut back on the plans and ease the need to invest in more capital for the network. Its decision may indicate whether it is favoring the consumer or Wall Street. \n \n When I wrote about Sprint eventually dropping the unlimited-data plan, analysts gave it a year to 18 months before a change would happen. But with the iPhone becoming available to Sprint customers, that timetable could be accelerated. Thanks to its more affordable data plans, Sprint has a higher base of smartphone customers than its rivals--roughly half of its total customers. \n \n While it has gotten used to dealing with the bandwidth-intensive Android phone, Sprint may be in for another pounding, once more customers start upgrading their basic phones for the iPhone. \n \n And even if the iPhone isn\'t significantly more data-hungry than its Android counterparts, Sprint may use the iPhone\'s reputation as an excuse to close off the unlimited-data spigot. \n \n So what does that mean for customers? If the iPhone does come out for Sprint, hop on an unlimited-data plan while you can (and thus get grandfathered in). The plan may not be around much longer.']",2,"– The iPhone 5 will be available on Sprint's network as well as Verizon's and AT&T's when the new phone is launched, insiders tell the Wall Street Journal. The device will hit the market in mid-October, not next month as many had expected, the sources say. The iPhone 5 deal will provide a major boost for the nation's third-largest carrier, whose bottom line had suffered without the ability to sell iPhones, analysts say. The deal, however, could end up backfiring on Sprint if it improves AT&T's chances of getting the green light from regulators to buy T-Mobile USA. Verizon ditched its unlimited plans not long after it launched its version of the iPhone 4 earlier this year, notes Roger Cheng at CNET, who recommends that Sprint users hop on unlimited data plans now to get ""grandfathered in"" before the Sprint iPhone arrives."
"['Congressman Bob Goodlatte\'s son made the surprise announcement on Twitter Sunday night. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo Goodlatte\'s son donates to Democrat running to replace him \n \n A high-ranking Republican lawmaker\'s son donated the ""maximum amount"" to a Democrat running to replace his father. \n \n Bobby Goodlatte, the son of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), made the surprise announcement on Twitter Sunday night. Goodlatte is retiring after 13 terms in Congress. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n ""I just gave the maximum allowed donation to Jennifer Lewis, a democrat running for my father\'s congressional seat. I\'ve also gotten 5 other folks to commit to donate the max. 2018 is the year to flip districts — let\'s do this!"" Bobby Goodlatte wrote on Twitter, where he describes himself as a product designer and angel investor based in San Francisco. \n \n Lewis said she was surprised by Goodlatte’s public donation when she woke up Monday, calling it a “very exciting morning, to say the least.” The maximum individual donation is $2,700, according to the Federal Election Commission. \n \n “I really, really admire and respect his willingness to be so public about it, and it\'s tough when you don\'t politically agree with your family. And to do it in such a public way, with Congressman Goodlatte being such a huge force in our political world, it’s just, I\'m at a loss for words in a lot of ways,” Lewis said. \n \n The Lewis campaign raised more than $15,000 in donations after Bobby Goodlatte announced his support, spokesman Josh Stanfield said. \n \n Bobby Goodlatte plans to help out with the Lewis campaign heading into the November midterm elections, Lewis said. His donation has inspired others to follow suit and give money, though Lewis did not say how many donations her campaign had received Monday. Bobby Goodlatte did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n “He is totally willing to help us out in any way we want him to help us. We\'re kind of in discussion of what plans we can make until November,” Lewis said. “We\'re already seeing it has kind of given us an adrenaline shot this morning, for sure.” \n \n Later in the day, Bobby Goodlatte laid into his father after news broke that FBI agent Peter Strzok had been fired. \n \n ""I’m deeply embarrassed that Peter Strzok’s career was ruined by my father’s political grandstanding. That committee hearing was a low point for Congress. Thank you for your service sir. You are a patriot,"" Bobby Goodlatte said in a tweet Monday afternoon. Strzok drew criticism from conservatives earlier this summer when an inspector general investigation unearthed text messages Strzok wrote that were critical of President Donald Trump. \n \n Regardless of his son\'s criticism, Goodlatte’s district is a challenge for Democrats. Trump carried the central Virginia district with nearly 60 percent of the vote in 2016, and Mitt Romney did the same in the 2012 presidential election. Goodlatte received two-thirds of the vote that year. \n \n Republican nominee Ben Cline starts with a base of support in the district after 16 years in the state House of Delegates. Cline had previously served as Goodlatte’s chief of staff. He has outraised Lewis more than 5-to-1 through June 30, the end of the most recent FEC reporting period. Cline’s office did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Bobby Goodlatte\'s donation comes as Democrats across the country edge toward flipping the House and gaining a majority. Lewis beat three Democratic competitors in the state\'s primary election in June, grabbing 48 percent of the vote. \n \n “I truly believe we will win in November. We’ve been having these conversations with folks where, yes, you may have never voted for a Democrat before, but if you want health care for you and your kids, if you want a living wage for you and your kids, if you want income equality and affordable housing,” Lewis said. “These are the things people are talking about. We’re seeing very good success from canvassing.” \n \n Goodlatte\'s office did not respond to a request for comment.', ""A top-ranking House Republican, Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte, is getting a lot of heat for his conduct as the chair of the House Judiciary Committee in the lead-up to FBI agent Peter Strzok’s firing — including from his own son. \n \n Goodlatte’s son Bobby Goodlatte, a venture capitalist based in San Francisco, blasted his father for his role in ruining Strzok’s career on Twitter Monday, one day after announcing his support for the Democrat running in Goodlatte’s congressional district. \n \n “I’m deeply embarrassed that Peter Strzok’s career was ruined by my father’s political grandstanding. That committee hearing was a low point for Congress,” Bobby Goodlatte tweeted. “Thank you for your service sir. You are a patriot.” \n \n Bob Goodlatte has been in the House since 1993 — the majority of his son Bobby’s life. He will retire from Congress at the end of 2018, which also marks his term limit as chair of the House Judiciary Committee. \n \n On Sunday, Bobby Goodlatte said he had donated to Democratic candidate Jennifer Lewis, a mental health worker who is running to fill his father’s seat in Virginia’s Sixth Congressional District, urging others to do the same. \n \n “This is how we show that we’re tired of the lack of decorum in Congress,” the younger Goodlatte tweeted. Bobby Goodlatte, a former Facebook employee, was a Hillary Clinton supporter in 2016, according to his Facebook, and has said he and his father are from “the exact opposite sides of the political spectrum,” in an interview with TechCrunch. In 2015, he started a project called OpenVote, a platform that let people pledge their votes and share arguments for their views. \n \n I just gave the maximum allowed donation to Jennifer Lewis, a democrat running for my father's congressional seat.

Cline has out-fundraised Lewis in a solidly Republican district that went for Donald Trump by double digits in 2016. \n \n Goodlatte has been conservative leader in the House, especially in the last year and a half under Trump. He’s known for pushing the president’s hardline immigration agenda and leading the House’s investigation into the FBI’s conduct in 2016. The committee’s investigation into the Justice Department’s conduct — specifically how the federal agency began its investigation into Russia’s election meddling and possible ties to the Trump’s campaign — has become part of a broader challenge from conservatives to the credibility of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. \n \n In June, Goodlatte presided over congressional testimony from Strzok, the FBI agent conservatives say was at the center of an FBI conspiracy to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016. The hearing, which lasted more than nine hours, quickly devolved into a partisan shouting match. \n \n The spectacle has been par for the course in the House Judiciary Committee, which includes some of the House’s most outspoken conservative Trump defenders, like Reps. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Jim Jordan (R-OH), and Matt Gaetz (R-FL) — all of whom have behind a conservative push to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. \n \n It seems that Goodlatte’s son, at least, has had enough."", 'Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Strzok said the texts, including ones in which he called Trump a ""disaster"" and said ""We\'ll stop"" a Trump candidacy, did not reflect political bias and had not infected his work. \n \n Congressman Goodlatte asked colleagues to imagine being investigated by someone who ""hated you"" and ""disparaged you in all manner of ways."" \n \n ""Would anyone sitting here today believe that this was an acceptable state of affairs, particularly at an agency whose motto is \'Fidelity, Bravery and Integrity\'? I think not,"" Goodlatte said. \n \n When Strzok declined to answer some questions on the Russia probe, Goodlatte suggested Republicans might recess the hearing and hold him in contempt.

""We have never said that the pieces are part of MH370 but have so far identified them only as floating objects."" \n \n The U.S. Navy said it was sending a second P8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft to help in the search for the missing Boeing 777. \n \n ""It\'s critical to continue searching for debris so we can reverse-forecast the wind, current and sea state since March 8th to recreate the position where MH370 possibly went into the water,"" said Commander Tom Moneymaker, a U.S. 7th Fleet oceanographer. \n \n The United States has also sent a device that can be towed behind a ship to pick up faint pings from the plane\'s black box voice and data recorders, but time is running out. \n \n ""We\'ve got to get this initial position right prior to deploying the Towed Pinger Locator since the MH370\'s black box has a limited battery life and we can\'t afford to lose time searching in the wrong area,"" Moneymaker said. \n \n NEW IMAGES \n \n The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is coordinating the effort, said it would give details later on the search after flights were halted on Thursday. \n \n ""It\'s the nature of search and rescue. It\'s a fickle beast,"" Flying Officer Peter Moore, the captain of an Australian AP-3C Orion, told Reuters aboard the plane after it turned around 1,000 km (600 miles) from the search zone. \n \n ""This is incredibly important to us. The reality is we have 239 people whose families want some information and closure."" \n \n The objects spotted by the Thai satellite on Monday were between 2 meters (6.5 ft) and 16 meters (52 ft) in size and were in an area around 2,700 km (1,680 miles) southwest of Perth, Snidvongs said. \n \n The prolonged and so far fruitless search and investigation have taken a toll, with dozens of distraught relatives of 150 Chinese passengers clashing with police and accusing Malaysia of ""delays and deception"". \n \n China has repeatedly voiced its frustration with the efforts of Malaysia to find the plane. China\'s special envoy to Malaysia said on Thursday that Beijing was doing its best to push the Southeast Asian nation to coordinate the international search effort, state news agency Xinhua said. \n \n Chinese insurance companies have started paying compensation to the families of passengers, Xinhua reported separately. \n \n A U.S.-based law firm has said it expects to represent families of more than half of the passengers in a lawsuit against the carrier and Boeing, alleging the plane had crashed due to mechanical failure. \n \n (Additional reporting by Suilee Wee in Beijing, Niluksi Koswanage in Kuala Lumpur, Stanley White in Tokyo and Amy Sawitta Lefevre in Bangkok; Writing by Lincoln Feast and Alex Richardson; Editing by Dean Yates)', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Thai satellite firm said the objects were yet to be identified \n \n A Thai satellite has detected some 300 objects in an area of the southern Indian Ocean being searched for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. \n \n The images were taken by the Thaichote satellite on 24 March, a day after images from a French satellite purported to show 122 floating objects. \n \n Flight MH370 disappeared on 8 March with 239 people on board.

He said the effort to find the box could take years. \n \n “Given the remoteness of the site and the depth of the water and the weather down there, the black box will be almost impossible to find,” he told The Telegraph. “It will then be a case of digging through the wreckage field, possibly for a couple of years.” \n \n A further difficulty for the crash investigators is that the crucial moment for understanding the unusual flight revolves around the period during which its communications systems were disabled and it took a sharp turn westward before flying silently for about seven hours. This occurred during the first hour of the flight, but the black box records cockpit communication on a two hour loop and deletes all but the final two hours. \n \n Though the flight data will have survived, Mr Barry said, “the bit we are interested in – where they lost contact with air traffic control – would have been overridden unless power to the recorder was lost.” \n \n On Wednesday Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s acting transport minister, said new satellite images had found objects ranging from 3 to 75 feet across an area of 154 square miles in the southern Indian Ocean. \n \n He described the sighting of an apparent debris field as “the most credible lead we have so far”. \n \n The images, captured through clouds by Airbus Defence and Space in France four days ago, were about 1,589 miles southwest of Perth in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean. The zone tallies with previous images captured by United States and Chinese satellites. \n \n “We cannot tell whether the potential objects are from MH370,” Mr Hishammuddin said. “Nevertheless, this is another new lead that will help direct the search operation.” \n \n Twelve aircraft flew over the search area on Wednesday but spotted only three objects, including two items believed to be rope and a blue piece of flotsam. No wreckage has been found, nor any confirmed sign of the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft, since it disappeared with 239 passengers and crew aboard after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8. \n \n Mr Hishammuddin said authorities have begun looking at the steps that will need to be taken after the crash site and wreckage are found. The top priority is to locate the black box which will help to explain the cause of the crash. \n \n As the search continued, a multimillion-dollar lawsuit was initiated in the United States against Malaysia Airlines and Boeing.

"['Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC hands-on \n \n This week the folks at Lenovo have made it clear that they want to get into your living room, and they want to do it with a massive gaming Table – you read that right. This machine is known as the Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC, a beast of a device with a 27-inch touchscreen and the ability to work upright, on its side, and with a set of accessories that make it a full-on board game-capable beast. \n \n The IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC’s full details can be found in our original reveal post, it also making the case for Lenovo’s newest term: Phygital. This term makes for the mix of physical game playing and digital interaction, with this gaming table allowing you to play table hockey, dice-base board games, and everything in-between. \n \n The machine we had a peek at here in its current form had fabulous viewing angles and a rather realistically nice setup – in other words, it felt as though we’d really, actually use it in the real world. Not such a thing can be said about all massive touchscreen devices such as this. What we got from our first experience was this: we definitely need one to be able to play Candy Land in the future. \n \n As it stands, we’ll be playing some of Lenovo’s own games as well as a set of games that have been optimized for play on this device specifically by 3rd party systems. Can’t wait for the real push! Check out the rest of our Lenovo coverage and stick around our CES portal for more action from all angles all week long!', ""This is at once pretty cool and also very, really, incredibly silly and dumb. But that's not a bad thing! Here's Lenovo's Horizon desktop computer. It's half Minority Report, half newjack board game. Oh, and also a full Windows 8 all-in-one computer. \n \n Lenovo's all-in-ones have contorted down to be worked on horizontally for a while now, the Horizon is specifically designed to be picked up, moved around, and used by multiple people. It's got a rubber edge to protect it from bangs, and to make it easier to carry, and its screen is drop-proof (though not spill-proof). \n \n Advertisement \n \n It uses what Lenovo calls the Aura UI, which uses drag-wheels to launch videos, pictures, apps, and games. You can use gestures to isolate one video, zoom or shrink, clean the whole desktop, or close all open files. The Horizon comes with 15 pre-loaded apps, and there are 3000 more in its app store. Lenovo says it's got five major developers making games for the Horizon, headlined by EA and Ubisoft. \n \n The Horizon comes with a bunch joysticks to play its games, and can run on battery power if you want to take it away from its power source—like outside into a club house, if your kids are very rich an insane. It weighs 17 pounds, so they better be strong. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Internally, this is a regular all-in-one. It goes from i3 to i7, can go up to 16GB of RAM, and has discrete graphics. Its cheapest configuration starts at $1000. It's basically the same purchase as if you'd buy any other all-in-one, just with this functionality added. Lenovo has a custom stand for it, so it can be a waist-level console in the middle of your house. Unfortunately, the automated space-age table/desk/gaming center from the video is just a concept for now. \n \n The Horizon is cool—and also very, very gimmicky. It's sort of like the Wii U in that it's deeply centered on in-person, multi-user experiences, but when you're just by yourself, you probably won't use any of this new stuff. Still, it seems like the kind of thing that all your friends might not actually want, but would be more than happy to come over to your house and play with."", 'Apparently Lenovo liked what it saw from Sony\'s Tap 20, because here at CES the company is introducing its own ""portable"" desktop PC. The IdeaCentre Horizon is primarily a Windows 8-enabled all-in-one — Lenovo calls it a ""table PC"" — with a 27-inch, 1080p 10-finger touchscreen, Intel\'s Core i7 processors and discrete graphics. But it\'s also portable, at least in theory, thanks to an internal battery that Lenovo says will power the gigantic device for two hours at a time. The gigantic slate is only 1.06 inches thick, but it weighs 17 pounds, so its actual viability as a tablet will vary with your upper-body strength. In a more practical nod to the Horizon\'s touch-friendliness, Its hinge lets it either sit up at a normal angle for a PC, or lay flat on a table. \n \n When you lay the Horizon flat, Lenovo\'s ""Moon Dial"" interface automatically opens, providing a wheel-based interface for launching apps, flipping through pictures, and moving things around. It\'s incredibly reminiscent of Microsoft\'s original Surface interface, turning your table into a giant touchscreen. Gestures let you move things around, fling them to the edges, shake them to show similar objects, and much more. The Horizon doesn\'t interact with other devices — which was maybe the coolest feature of the original Surface — but it\'s a pretty fun concept nonetheless. We spent a few minutes using the Horizon, and though it\'s definitely a gimmicky idea, it\'s definitely fun to use and play with. \n \n Almost as cool as the Microsoft Surface — but much more gimmicky \n \n Lenovo designed the Horizon for families and offices, for more than one person to use at a time. It comes with a handful of specific accessories to that end, too: four joysticks, e-dice, and strikers, which Lenovo says creates a more physical gaming experience than is typical with a laptop. (It\'s calling that experience ""phygital."" No, really, that\'s what it\'s called.) A number of games also come pre-loaded, like Monopoly, King of the Opera, Raiding Company, and others. We played Air Hockey using the included joysticks, and it was fun, though using a physical joystick to hit a virtual puck felt a little odd. We\'re not so sold on this phygital thing yet. \n \n The Horizon will be available ""in early summer,"" and will start at $1,699. The beginning of a trend for Lenovo, with more of these table PCs coming soon — the company\'s showing off a 36-inch prototype called ""Gamma"" at CES as well. Whether that one can be carried around too, we\'re not quite sure. \n \n Grid View', ""Who would have thought that, rather than hybrid laptops or Windows 8 tablets, the most interesting new hardware trend in computers for 2013 would be tabletop PCs? That's an unofficial term I use to describe the growing number of systems that straddle the line between all-in-one desktops, megatablets, and home furnishings. \n \n The latest, and my favorite to date, is the Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon 27. No points for guessing from the name that it's built around a 27-inch display. Sure, it functions perfectly well as a desktop all-in-one, as long as you don't mind the screen's bottom edge being so close to your desk, but to see where it really shines, push the spring-loaded hinge down and lay the system flat on your table, desk, or even floor. \n \n We've seen other variations on this theme since the launch of Windows 8 last year, and there are more still to come. But so far the tabletop PCs we've tested have had smaller screens. There's the Sony Vaio Tap 20, which has a 20-inch display and looks the most similar to the Horizon. Then there's the Asus Transformer AIO, with an 18-inch screen that detaches from a docking stand -- only to switch over into Android mode because the Intel CPU is inexplicably inside the base. Finally, there's the 18-inch Dell XPS 18, which has a very thin, light screen that pulls easily off its weighted display stand and is the most conveniently portable of the bunch. \n \n All of those previous tabletop PCs have an element of easy portability the Horizon lacks. It may not be entirely ergonomically correct, but they can all be passed around the living room or meeting room, especially the lightweight Dell XPS 18. But that also means their lie-flat modes are best viewed by one or two people. Think of them as platforms for small-form sharing. \n \n The Horizon, in contrast, feels like it's meant to be semipermanently anchored flat on your desk or coffee table. In fact, when we first saw the Horizon at CES 2013, Lenovo showed it off mounted inside a custom-built coffee table that opened up to allow access to the screen. Sadly, there's no such accessory available yet, although if tabletop PCs take off, I'm sure you'll find several on Kickstarter in short order. Instead, Lenovo says a simpler rolling cart will be available later in the year. \n \n Sarah Tew/CNET \n \n One can argue whether a PC with an Intel Core i5/i7 CPU, a 1TB, 5,400rpm hard drive, 8GB of RAM, and an entry-level Nvidia GeForce 620M graphics card is worth $1,600 or more, depending on the exact configuration, and I've certainly criticized high-end laptops before for having the same components one can find in less expensive systems. But in this case, the Horizon, much like the Dell XPS 18, is a product that comes off better in person than on paper. It reimagines how you use a Windows PC, giving mundane tasks such as reading online news or watching videos a new twist, and is -- most importantly -- just plain fun to use. \n \n Part of that comes from Aura, a touch-centric operating-system overlay that switches on automatically when you fold the kickstand in and lay the system down flat. A collection of several custom apps and games is available in this mode, including the requisite air hockey (seemingly the first app everyone thinks to install on a tabletop PC), Texas Hold 'Em poker, and Monopoly. \n \n Some of the apps work better than others, and the entire Aura overlay has just a hint of lag that makes twitch gaming annoying, but it works fine for slower-paced games and apps or manipulating photo and video files. Even with our Core i7 CPU, Aura felt sluggish compared with the standard Windows 8 interface. \n \n Much like Google Glass, Ouya, or the Pebble Watch, the Horizon's tabletop mode is very cool, but doesn't yet have the level of polish or software support to be truly mainstream. Still, it's great fun to use and always attracted a crowd when I wheeled it around the CNET offices on a makeshift rolling cart. Its saving grace is that it works perfectly well as a touch-screen Windows 8 all-in-one, with decent specs and a big 27-inch 1,920x1,080-pixel-resolution display. A comparable 27-inch all-in-one from another PC maker might cost you a few hundred dollars less right now, but I predict within a year or so most all-in-one PCs will be tabletop models with either fold-down hinges or removable screens. \n \n Sarah Tew/CNET \n \n Note that right now, the Core i5 configuration of the Horizon (as reviewed here) is $1,699, and the Core i7 configuration is $1,849, and both come with a set of air hockey paddles and suction cup joysticks, and a clever wireless six-sided die (in case you were wondering about gaming being the big selling point here). \n \n The tabletop software is still a generation away from being ready for prime time, and while I like the Horizon a lot, at those prices it gets a qualified recommendation, depending on how much you like the idea of a coffee table PC. \n \n But, there's an important twist: starting in June, we're told that Best Buy will stock similar Core i5 and i7 configurations for $1,499 and $1,599, at which point the Horizon 27 becomes a very valid alternative to standard all-in-one desktops, with a cool tabletop mode you can use as often (or not) as you like. If that price cut indeed happens, we'll revisit the rating for this review in a few weeks. \n \n Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon 27 Asus Transformer AIO Sony Vaio Tap 20 Dell Inspiron One 2330 Dell XPS 18 Price $1,699 $1,299 $999 $1,199 $1,349 Display size/pixel resolution 27-inch, 1,920x1,080 touch screen 18.4-inch, 1,920x1,080 touch screen 20-inch, 1,600x900 touch screen 23-inch, 1,920x1,080 touch screen 18-inch, 1,920x1,080 touch screen PC CPU 1.8GHz Intel Core i5-3427U 3.1GHz Intel Core i5-3350P 1.7GHz Intel Core i5-3317U 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-3330S 1.8GHz Intel Core i5-3337U PC memory 8GB 1,600MHZ DDR3 SDRAM 8GB 1,600MHz DDR3 SDRAM 4GB 1,600MHz DDR3 SDRAM 8GB 1,600MHZ DDR3 SDRAM 8GB 1,600MHZ DDR3 SDRAM Graphics 2GB Nvidia GeForce GT620M 2GB Nvidia GeForce GT 730M 64MB Intel HD Graphics 4000 32MB Intel HD Graphics 2500 32MB Intel HD Graphics 4000 Storage 1TB, 5,400rpm hard drive 1TB, 7,200rpm hard drive 750GB, 5,400rpm hard drive 1TB, 7,200rpm hard drive 1TB, 7,200rpm hard drive Optical drive None dual-layer DVD burner None dual-layer DVD burner None Networking Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n wireless, Bluetooth 4.0 Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n wireless, Bluetooth 4.0 Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n wireless, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n wireless, Bluetooth 4.0 Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n wireless, Bluetooth 4.0 Operating system Windows 8 (64-bit) Windows 8 (64-bit) Windows 8 (64-bit) Windows 8 (64-bit) Windows 8 Pro (64-bit) \n \n Design and features \n \n The 18.6-pound Horizon 27 is just plain big. Unlike some other 27-inch all-in-one systems such as the Dell XPS One 27 and the Apple iMac, it has no separate base for connections or an adjustable arm -- everything is built right into the main unit, including a heavy-duty kickstand. \n \n Unlike the kickstands in similar systems, this one feels spring-loaded -- you won't be pulling it out and pushing it in with one hand while adjusting the screen angle with the other. When used exactly as intended, it works well. That means that with the Horizon sitting upright, you gently but firmly push down and back on the top edge, and the kickstand folds in and lowers the system until it's lying flat, a move that also launches the built-in Aura tabletop software. Lifting the Horizon up by the same edge deploys the spring-loaded kickstand, and you can stop at any angle along the way, up to about 85 degrees, and the system will stay perfectly still. \n \n Sarah Tew/CNET \n \n But, when you try to move or adjust the system outside of those narrow parameters, the hinge and kickstand can be a hassle. Even lifting the Horizon slightly up from the table to move it over ends up deploying the kickstand, which you can't fold back down without great difficulty. \n \n Several times I've had the included game accessories sitting on top of the screen, then the kickstand popped out a bit while I tried to move the system ever so slightly. In those cases, I had to remove all the accessories, allow the kickstand to fully unfold (which popped us out of the Aura interface and back into Windows 8), then fold everything back down again. The main issue seems to be that the kickstand is held in place in tabletop mode by the system's weight, and not any kind of docking mechanism. \n \n With the Horizon down in tabletop mode, the Aura interface gives you access to Lenovo's video and music players and basic photo display software. Littering the tabletop surface with photo and video file windows is easy; dismissing them requires a multifinger spread on the screen. While it's fun to rotate and resize a video clip with two fingers while it's playing, I suspect most of your multimedia use will remain within the Windows apps, iTunes, Netflix, and so on. \n \n The built-in games are the real appeal here. The air hockey game is fun, and uses the included paddles (little plastic sticks with felt bottoms) to good effect -- still the control isn't exactly one-to-one real-time, there's a bit of lag, which we've seen in every similar game on other Windows 8 touch-screen PCs. \n \n Other games, such as a roulette wheel and a poker table, are fun once you get past the anime-style graphics and music, clearly not designed for the American market. I'd love to see a more relaxed, sophisticated poker game. However, even the odd Lenovo version is something of a killer app for the system. \n \n Sarah Tew/CNET \n \n Players get their hole cards dealt face down (the screen is big enough for four players to gather around, but just barely), and then cup one hand over the virtual cards and use the index finger of the other hand to bend the corners of the cards up, revealing their value. There's also an Android app that can display your cards in private, but that's somehow less fun than the onscreen peek move. \n \n A decent version of Monopoly is also included, along with a few other games that you'll probably try once and never launch again. More games and apps are available in the Lenovo App Store, which is exactly what it sounds like. It requires you to register, and most apps cost as much as or more than they would from other sources. The few free apps I downloaded ended up on the regular Windows 8 menu screen, not in the Aura list of apps -- there may be some way to add them, but I have yet to find it. An app called BlueStacks is also included, and it acts as an Android emulator, making it possible to use many Android apps, though your mileage may vary.""]",4,"– Tablet too small for you? Try an entire table. Lenovo is releasing a 27-inch Windows 8 PC billed as a computer for multiple users, CNET reports. A wheeled stand (which may not reach the US) invites users to gather 'round, while another concept turns the computer into a coffee table. Much of the software demonstrated so far consists of games, with joysticks and air hockey paddles to go with them. So how good is the IdeaCentre Horizon, with versions at $999 and $1,699? A look at some early reactions: It's ""very, really, incredibly silly and dumb. But that's not a bad thing!"" notes Kyle Wagner at Gizmodo. The all-in-one ""seems like the kind of thing that all your friends might not actually want, but would be more than happy to come over to your house and play with."" The Verge offers a similar sentiment: The Horizon is ""almost as cool as the Microsoft Surface—but much more gimmicky."" Still, it's ""definitely fun to use and play with."" Chris Burns at SlashGear is more complimentary, pointing to ""fabulous viewing angles and a rather realistically nice setup—in other words, it felt as though we’d really, actually use it in the real world. Not such a thing can be said about all massive touchscreen devices such as this."""
"[""As a neurosurgeon, I did not believe in the phenomenon of near-death experiences. I grew up in a scientific world, the son of a neurosurgeon. I followed my father’s path and became an academic neurosurgeon, teaching at Harvard Medical School and other universities. I understand what happens to the brain when people are near death, and I had always believed there were good scientific explanations for the heavenly out-of-body journeys described by those who narrowly escaped death. \n \n The brain is an astonishingly sophisticated but extremely delicate mechanism. Reduce the amount of oxygen it receives by the smallest amount and it will react. It was no big surprise that people who had undergone severe trauma would return from their experiences with strange stories. But that didn’t mean they had journeyed anywhere real. \n \n Although I considered myself a faithful Christian, I was so more in name than in actual belief. I didn’t begrudge those who wanted to believe that Jesus was more than simply a good man who had suffered at the hands of the world. I sympathized deeply with those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally. In fact, I envied such people the security that those beliefs no doubt provided. But as a scientist, I simply knew better than to believe them myself. \n \n In the fall of 2008, however, after seven days in a coma during which the human part of my brain, the neocortex, was inactivated, I experienced something so profound that it gave me a scientific reason to believe in consciousness after death. \n \n I know how pronouncements like mine sound to skeptics, so I will tell my story with the logic and language of the scientist I am. \n \n Very early one morning four years ago, I awoke with an extremely intense headache. Within hours, my entire cortex—the part of the brain that controls thought and emotion and that in essence makes us human—had shut down. Doctors at Lynchburg General Hospital in Virginia, a hospital where I myself worked as a neurosurgeon, determined that I had somehow contracted a very rare bacterial meningitis that mostly attacks newborns. E. coli bacteria had penetrated my cerebrospinal fluid and were eating my brain. \n \n When I entered the emergency room that morning, my chances of survival in anything beyond a vegetative state were already low. They soon sank to near nonexistent. For seven days I lay in a deep coma, my body unresponsive, my higher-order brain functions totally offline. \n \n Alexander discusses his experience on the Science channel's 'Through the Wormhole.' \n \n Then, on the morning of my seventh day in the hospital, as my doctors weighed whether to discontinue treatment, my eyes popped open. \n \n ‘You have nothing to fear.’ ‘There is nothing you can do wrong.’ The message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief. (Photo illustration by Newsweek; Source: Buena Vista Images-Getty Images) \n \n There is no scientific explanation for the fact that while my body lay in coma, my mind—my conscious, inner self—was alive and well. While the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them, my brain-free consciousness journeyed to another, larger dimension of the universe: a dimension I’d never dreamed existed and which the old, pre-coma me would have been more than happy to explain was a simple impossibility. \n \n But that dimension—in rough outline, the same one described by countless subjects of near-death experiences and other mystical states—is there. It exists, and what I saw and learned there has placed me quite literally in a new world: a world where we are much more than our brains and bodies, and where death is not the end of consciousness but rather a chapter in a vast, and incalculably positive, journey. \n \n On the iPad Read Newsweek’s 2007 story on how science is bringing more heart-attack victims back to life \n \n I’m not the first person to have discovered evidence that consciousness exists beyond the body. Brief, wonderful glimpses of this realm are as old as human history. But as far as I know, no one before me has ever traveled to this dimension (a) while their cortex was completely shut down, and (b) while their body was under minute medical observation, as mine was for the full seven days of my coma. \n \n All the chief arguments against near-death experiences suggest that these experiences are the results of minimal, transient, or partial malfunctioning of the cortex. My near-death experience, however, took place not while my cortex was malfunctioning, but while it was simply off. This is clear from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological examinations. According to current medical understanding of the brain and mind, there is absolutely no way that I could have experienced even a dim and limited consciousness during my time in the coma, much less the hyper-vivid and completely coherent odyssey I underwent. \n \n It took me months to come to terms with what happened to me. Not just the medical impossibility that I had been conscious during my coma, but—more importantly—the things that happened during that time. Toward the beginning of my adventure, I was in a place of clouds. Big, puffy, pink-white ones that showed up sharply against the deep blue-black sky. \n \n Reliving History: The search for the meaning of the afterlife is as old as humanity itself. Over the years Newsweek has run numerous covers about religion, God, and that search. As Dr. Alexander says, it’s unlikely we’ll know the answer in our lifetimes, but that doesn’t mean we won’t keep asking. \n \n Higher than the clouds—immeasurably higher—flocks of transparent, shimmering beings arced across the sky, leaving long, streamerlike lines behind them. \n \n Birds? Angels? These words registered later, when I was writing down my recollections. But neither of these words do justice to the beings themselves, which were quite simply different from anything I have known on this planet. They were more advanced. Higher forms. \n \n A sound, huge and booming like a glorious chant, came down from above, and I wondered if the winged beings were producing it. Again, thinking about it later, it occurred to me that the joy of these creatures, as they soared along, was such that they had to make this noise—that if the joy didn’t come out of them this way then they would simply not otherwise be able to contain it. The sound was palpable and almost material, like a rain that you can feel on your skin but doesn’t get you wet. \n \n Seeing and hearing were not separate in this place where I now was. I could hear the visual beauty of the silvery bodies of those scintillating beings above, and I could see the surging, joyful perfection of what they sang. It seemed that you could not look at or listen to anything in this world without becoming a part of it—without joining with it in some mysterious way. Again, from my present perspective, I would suggest that you couldn’t look at anything in that world at all, for the word “at” itself implies a separation that did not exist there. Everything was distinct, yet everything was also a part of everything else, like the rich and intermingled designs on a Persian carpet ... or a butterfly’s wing. \n \n It gets stranger still. For most of my journey, someone else was with me. A woman. She was young, and I remember what she looked like in complete detail. She had high cheekbones and deep-blue eyes. Golden brown tresses framed her lovely face. When first I saw her, we were riding along together on an intricately patterned surface, which after a moment I recognized as the wing of a butterfly. In fact, millions of butterflies were all around us—vast fluttering waves of them, dipping down into the woods and coming back up around us again. It was a river of life and color, moving through the air. The woman’s outfit was simple, like a peasant’s, but its colors—powder blue, indigo, and pastel orange-peach—had the same overwhelming, super-vivid aliveness that everything else had. She looked at me with a look that, if you saw it for five seconds, would make your whole life up to that point worth living, no matter what had happened in it so far. It was not a romantic look. It was not a look of friendship. It was a look that was somehow beyond all these, beyond all the different compartments of love we have down here on earth. It was something higher, holding all those other kinds of love within itself while at the same time being much bigger than all of them. \n \n Without using any words, she spoke to me. The message went through me like a wind, and I instantly understood that it was true. I knew so in the same way that I knew that the world around us was real—was not some fantasy, passing and insubstantial. \n \n The message had three parts, and if I had to translate them into earthly language, I’d say they ran something like this: \n \n “You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.” \n \n “You have nothing to fear.” \n \n “There is nothing you can do wrong.” \n \n The message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief. It was like being handed the rules to a game I’d been playing all my life without ever fully understanding it. \n \n “We will show you many things here,” the woman said, again, without actually using these words but by driving their conceptual essence directly into me. “But eventually, you will go back.” \n \n To this, I had only one question. \n \n Back where? \n \n The universe as I experienced it in my coma is ... the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways. (Ed Morris / Getty Images) \n \n A warm wind blew through, like the kind that spring up on the most perfect summer days, tossing the leaves of the trees and flowing past like heavenly water. A divine breeze. It changed everything, shifting the world around me into an even higher octave, a higher vibration. \n \n Although I still had little language function, at least as we think of it on earth, I began wordlessly putting questions to this wind, and to the divine being that I sensed at work behind or within it. \n \n Where is this place? \n \n Who am I? \n \n Why am I here? \n \n Each time I silently put one of these questions out, the answer came instantly in an explosion of light, color, love, and beauty that blew through me like a crashing wave. What was important about these blasts was that they didn’t simply silence my questions by overwhelming them. They answered them, but in a way that bypassed language. Thoughts entered me directly. But it wasn’t thought like we experience on earth. It wasn’t vague, immaterial, or abstract. These thoughts were solid and immediate—hotter than fire and wetter than water—and as I received them I was able to instantly and effortlessly understand concepts that would have taken me years to fully grasp in my earthly life. \n \n I continued moving forward and found myself entering an immense void, completely dark, infinite in size, yet also infinitely comforting. Pitch-black as it was, it was also brimming over with light: a light that seemed to come from a brilliant orb that I now sensed near me. The orb was a kind of “interpreter” between me and this vast presence surrounding me. It was as if I were being born into a larger world, and the universe itself was like a giant cosmic womb, and the orb (which I sensed was somehow connected with, or even identical to, the woman on the butterfly wing) was guiding me through it. \n \n Later, when I was back, I found a quotation by the 17th-century Christian poet Henry Vaughan that came close to describing this magical place, this vast, inky-black core that was the home of the Divine itself. \n \n “There is, some say, in God a deep but dazzling darkness ...” \n \n That was it exactly: an inky darkness that was also full to brimming with light. \n \n I know full well how extraordinary, how frankly unbelievable, all this sounds. Had someone—even a doctor—told me a story like this in the old days, I would have been quite certain that they were under the spell of some delusion. But what happened to me was, far from being delusional, as real or more real than any event in my life. That includes my wedding day and the birth of my two sons. \n \n What happened to me demands explanation. \n \n Modern physics tells us that the universe is a unity—that it is undivided. Though we seem to live in a world of separation and difference, physics tells us that beneath the surface, every object and event in the universe is completely woven up with every other object and event. There is no true separation. \n \n Before my experience these ideas were abstractions. Today they are realities. Not only is the universe defined by unity, it is also—I now know—defined by love. The universe as I experienced it in my coma is—I have come to see with both shock and joy—the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways. \n \n I’ve spent decades as a neurosurgeon at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in our country. I know that many of my peers hold—as I myself did—to the theory that the brain, and in particular the cortex, generates consciousness and that we live in a universe devoid of any kind of emotion, much less the unconditional love that I now know God and the universe have toward us. But that belief, that theory, now lies broken at our feet. What happened to me destroyed it, and I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the true nature of consciousness and making the fact that we are more, much more, than our physical brains as clear as I can, both to my fellow scientists and to people at large. \n \n I don’t expect this to be an easy task, for the reasons I described above. When the castle of an old scientific theory begins to show fault lines, no one wants to pay attention at first. The old castle simply took too much work to build in the first place, and if it falls, an entirely new one will have to be constructed in its place. \n \n I learned this firsthand after I was well enough to get back out into the world and talk to others—people, that is, other than my long-suffering wife, Holley, and our two sons—about what had happened to me. The looks of polite disbelief, especially among my medical friends, soon made me realize what a task I would have getting people to understand the enormity of what I had seen and experienced that week while my brain was down. \n \n One of the few places I didn’t have trouble getting my story across was a place I’d seen fairly little of before my experience: church. The first time I entered a church after my coma, I saw everything with fresh eyes. The colors of the stained-glass windows recalled the luminous beauty of the landscapes I’d seen in the world above. The deep bass notes of the organ reminded me of how thoughts and emotions in that world are like waves that move through you. And, most important, a painting of Jesus breaking bread with his disciples evoked the message that lay at the very heart of my journey: that we are loved and accepted unconditionally by a God even more grand and unfathomably glorious than the one I’d learned of as a child in Sunday school. \n \n Today many believe that the living spiritual truths of religion have lost their power, and that science, not faith, is the road to truth. Before my experience I strongly suspected that this was the case myself. \n \n But I now understand that such a view is far too simple. The plain fact is that the materialist picture of the body and brain as the producers, rather than the vehicles, of human consciousness is doomed. In its place a new view of mind and body will emerge, and in fact is emerging already. This view is scientific and spiritual in equal measure and will value what the greatest scientists of history themselves always valued above all: truth. \n \n Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander, M.D. To be published by Simon & Schuster, Inc.. Copyright (c) 2012 by Eben Alexander III, M.D. \n \n This new picture of reality will take a long time to put together. It won’t be finished in my time, or even, I suspect, my sons’ either. In fact, reality is too vast, too complex, and too irreducibly mysterious for a full picture of it ever to be absolutely complete. But in essence, it will show the universe as evolving, multi-dimensional, and known down to its every last atom by a God who cares for us even more deeply and fiercely than any parent ever loved their child."", 'Once upon a time, a neurosurgeon named Eben Alexander contracted a bad case of bacterial meningitis and fell into a coma. While immobile in his hospital bed, he experienced visions of such intense beauty that they changed everything—not just for him, but for all of us, and for science as a whole. According to Newsweek, Alexander’s experience proves that consciousness is independent of the brain, that death is an illusion, and that an eternity of perfect splendor awaits us beyond the grave—complete with the usual angels, clouds, and departed relatives, but also butterflies and beautiful girls in peasant dress. Our current understanding of the mind “now lies broken at our feet”—for, as the doctor writes, “What happened to me destroyed it, and I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the true nature of consciousness and making the fact that we are more, much more, than our physical brains as clear as I can, both to my fellow scientists and to people at large.” \n \n Well, I intend to spend the rest of the morning sparing him the effort. Whether you read it online or hold the physical object in your hands, this issue of Newsweek is best viewed as an archaeological artifact that is certain to embarrass us in the eyes of future generations. Its existence surely says more about our time than the editors at the magazine meant to say—for the cover alone reveals the abasement and desperation of our journalism, the intellectual bankruptcy and resultant tenacity of faith-based religion, and our ubiquitous confusion about the nature of scientific authority. The article is the modern equivalent of a 14th-century woodcut depicting the work of alchemists, inquisitors, Crusaders, and fortune-tellers. I hope our descendants understand that at least some of us were blushing. \n \n As many of you know, I am interested in “spiritual” experiences of the sort Alexander reports. Unlike many atheists, I don’t doubt the subjective phenomena themselves—that is, I don’t believe that everyone who claims to have seen an angel, or left his body in a trance, or become one with the universe, is lying or mentally ill. Indeed, I have had similar experiences myself in meditation, in lucid dreams (even while meditating in a lucid dream), and through the use of various psychedelics (in times gone by). I know that astonishing changes in the contents of consciousness are possible and can be psychologically transformative. \n \n And, unlike many neuroscientists and philosophers, I remain agnostic on the question of how consciousness is related to the physical world. There are, of course, very good reasons to believe that it is an emergent property of brain activity, just as the rest of the human mind obviously is. But we know nothing about how such a miracle of emergence might occur. And if consciousness were, in fact, irreducible—or even separable from the brain in a way that would give comfort to Saint Augustine—my worldview would not be overturned. I know that we do not understand consciousness, and nothing that I think I know about the cosmos, or about the patent falsity of most religious beliefs, requires that I deny this. So, although I am an atheist who can be expected to be unforgiving of religious dogma, I am not reflexively hostile to claims of the sort Alexander has made. In principle, my mind is open. (It really is.) \n \n But Alexander’s account is so bad—his reasoning so lazy and tendentious—that it would be beneath notice if not for the fact that it currently disgraces the cover of a major newsmagazine. Alexander is also releasing a book at the end of the month, Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife, which seems destined to become an instant bestseller. As much as I would like to simply ignore the unfolding travesty, it would be derelict of me to do so. \n \n But first things first: You really must read Alexander’s article. \n \n I trust that doing so has given you cause to worry that the good doctor is just another casualty of American-style Christianity—for though he claims to have been a nonbeliever before his adventures in coma, he presents the following self-portrait: \n \n Although I considered myself a faithful Christian, I was so more in name than in actual belief. I didn’t begrudge those who wanted to believe that Jesus was more than simply a good man who had suffered at the hands of the world. I sympathized deeply with those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally. In fact, I envied such people the security that those beliefs no doubt provided. But as a scientist, I simply knew better than to believe them myself. \n \n What it means to be a “faithful Christian” without “actual belief” is not spelled out, but few nonbelievers will be surprised when our hero’s scientific skepticism proves no match for his religious conditioning. Most of us have been around this block often enough to know that many “former atheists”—like Francis Collins—spent so long on the brink of faith, and yearned for its emotional consolations with such vampiric intensity, that the slightest breeze would send them spinning into the abyss. For Collins, you may recall, all it took to establish the divinity of Jesus and the coming resurrection of the dead was the sight of a frozen waterfall. Alexander seems to have required a ride on a psychedelic butterfly. In either case, it’s not the perception of beauty we should begrudge but the utter absence of intellectual seriousness with which the author interprets it. \n \n Everything—absolutely everything—in Alexander’s account rests on repeated assertions that his visions of heaven occurred while his cerebral cortex was “shut down,” “inactivated,” “completely shut down,” “totally offline,” and “stunned to complete inactivity.” The evidence he provides for this claim is not only inadequate—it suggests that he doesn’t know anything about the relevant brain science. Perhaps he has saved a more persuasive account for his book—though now that I’ve listened to an hour-long interview with him online, I very much doubt it. In his Newsweek article, Alexander asserts that the cessation of cortical activity was “clear from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological examinations.” To his editors, this presumably sounded like neuroscience. \n \n The problem, however, is that “CT scans and neurological examinations” can’t determine neuronal inactivity—in the cortex or anywhere else. And Alexander makes no reference to functional data that might have been acquired by fMRI, PET, or EEG—nor does he seem to realize that only this sort of evidence could support his case. Obviously, the man’s cortex is functioning now—he has, after all, written a book—so whatever structural damage appeared on CT could not have been “global.” (Otherwise, he would be claiming that his entire cortex was destroyed and then grew back.) Coma is not associated with the complete cessation of cortical activity, in any case. And to my knowledge, almost no one thinks that consciousness is purely a matter of cortical activity. Alexander’s unwarranted assumptions are proliferating rather quickly. Why doesn’t he know these things? He is, after all, a neurosurgeon who survived a coma and now claims to be upending the scientific worldview on the basis of the fact that his cortex was totally quiescent at the precise moment he was enjoying the best day of his life in the company of angels. Even if his entire cortex had truly shut down (again, an incredible claim), how can he know that his visions didn’t occur in the minutes and hours during which its functions returned? \n \n I confess that I found Alexander’s account so alarmingly unscientific that I began to worry that something had gone wrong with my own brain. So I sought the opinion of Mark Cohen, a pioneer in the field of neuroimaging who holds appointments in the Departments of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Science, Neurology, Psychology, Radiological Science, and Bioengineering at UCLA. (He was also my thesis advisor.) Here is part of what he had to say: \n \n This poetic interpretation of his experience is not supported by evidence of any kind. As you correctly point out, coma does not equate to “inactivation of the cerebral cortex” or “higher-order brain functions totally offline” or “neurons of [my] cortex stunned into complete inactivity”. These describe brain death, a one hundred percent lethal condition. There are many excellent scholarly articles that discuss the definitions of coma. (For example: 1 & 2) \n \n \n \n We are not privy to his EEG records, but high alpha activity is common in coma. Also common is “flat” EEG. The EEG can appear flat even in the presence of high activity, when that activity is not synchronous. For example, the EEG flattens in regions involved in direct task processing. This phenomenon is known as event-related desynchronization (hundreds of references). \n \n \n \n As is obvious to you, this is truth by authority. Neurosurgeons, however, are rarely well-trained in brain function. Dr. Alexander cuts brains; he does not appear to study them. “There is no scientific explanation for the fact that while my body lay in coma, my mind—my conscious, inner self—was alive and well. While the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them, my brain-free consciousness ...” True, science cannot explain brain-free consciousness. Of course, science cannot explain consciousness anyway. In this case, however, it would be parsimonious to reject the whole idea of consciousness in the absence of brain activity. Either his brain was active when he had these dreams, or they are a confabulation of whatever took place in his state of minimally conscious coma. \n \n \n \n There are many reports of people remembering dream-like states while in medical coma. They lack consistency, of course, but there is nothing particularly unique in Dr. Alexander’s unfortunate episode. \n \n Okay, so it appears that my own cortex hasn’t completely shut down. In fact, there are further problems with Alexander’s account. Not only does he appear ignorant of the relevant science, but he doesn’t realize how many people have experienced visions similar to his while their brains were operational. In his online interview we learn about the kinds of conversations he’s now having with skeptics: \n \n I guess one could always argue, “Well, your brain was probably just barely able to ignite real consciousness and then it would flip back into a very diseased state,” which doesn’t make any sense to me. Especially because that hyper-real state is so indescribable and so crisp. It’s totally unlike any drug experience. A lot of people have come up to me and said, “Oh that sounds like a DMT experience,” or “That sounds like ketamine.” Not at all. That is not even in the right ballpark. \n \n \n \n Those things do not explain the kind of clarity, the rich interactivity, the layer upon layer of understanding and of lessons taught by deceased loved ones and spiritual beings. \n \n “Not even in the right ballpark”? His experience sounds so much like a DMT trip that we are not only in the right ballpark, we are talking about the stitching on the same ball. Here is Alexander’s description of the afterlife: \n \n I was a speck on a beautiful butterfly wing; millions of other butterflies around us. We were flying through blooming flowers, blossoms on trees, and they were all coming out as we flew through them… [there were] waterfalls, pools of water, indescribable colors, and above there were these arcs of silver and gold light and beautiful hymns coming down from them. Indescribably gorgeous hymns. I later came to call them “angels,” those arcs of light in the sky. I think that word is probably fairly accurate…. \n \n \n \n Then we went out of this universe. I remember just seeing everything receding and initially I felt as if my awareness was in an infinite black void. It was very comforting but I could feel the extent of the infinity and that it was, as you would expect, impossible to put into words. I was there with that Divine presence that was not anything that I could visibly see and describe, and with a brilliant orb of light…. \n \n \n \n They said there were many things that they would show me, and they continued to do that. In fact, the whole higher-dimensional multiverse was this incredibly complex corrugated ball and all these lessons coming into me about it. Part of the lessons involved becoming all of what I was being shown. It was indescribable. \n \n \n \n But then I would find myself—and time out there I can say is totally different from what we call time. There was access from out there to any part of our space/time and that made it difficult to understand a lot of these memories because we always try to sequence things and put them in linear form and description. That just really doesn’t work. \n \n Everything that Alexander describes here and in his Newsweek article, including the parts I have left out, has been reported by DMT users. The similarity is uncanny. Here is how the late Terence McKenna described the prototypical DMT trance: \n \n Under the influence of DMT, the world becomes an Arabian labyrinth, a palace, a more than possible Martian jewel, vast with motifs that flood the gaping mind with complex and wordless awe. Color and the sense of a reality-unlocking secret nearby pervade the experience. There is a sense of other times, and of one’s own infancy, and of wonder, wonder and more wonder. It is an audience with the alien nuncio. In the midst of this experience, apparently at the end of human history, guarding gates that seem surely to open on the howling maelstrom of the unspeakable emptiness between the stars, is the Aeon. The Aeon, as Heraclitus presciently observed, is a child at play with colored balls. Many diminutive beings are present there—the tykes, the self-transforming machine elves of hyperspace. Are they the children destined to be father to the man? One has the impression of entering into an ecology of souls that lies beyond the portals of what we naively call death. I do not know. Are they the synesthetic embodiment of ourselves as the Other, or of the Other as ourselves? Are they the elves lost to us since the fading of the magic light of childhood? Here is a tremendum barely to be told, an epiphany beyond our wildest dreams. Here is the realm of that which is stranger than we can suppose. Here is the mystery, alive, unscathed, still as new for us as when our ancestors lived it fifteen thousand summers ago. The tryptamine entities offer the gift of new language, they sing in pearly voices that rain down as colored petals and flow through the air like hot metal to become toys and such gifts as gods would give their children. The sense of emotional connection is terrifying and intense. The Mysteries revealed are real and if ever fully told will leave no stone upon another in the small world we have gone so ill in. This is not the mercurial world of the UFO, to be invoked from lonely hilltops; this is not the siren song of lost Atlantis wailing through the trailer courts of crack-crazed America. DMT is not one of our irrational illusions. I believe that what we experience in the presence of DMT is real news. It is a nearby dimension—frightening, transformative, and beyond our powers to imagine, and yet to be explored in the usual way. We must send fearless experts, whatever that may come to mean, to explore and to report on what they find. (Terence McKenna, Food of the Gods, pp. 258-259.) \n \n Alexander believes that his E. coli-addled brain could not have produced his visions because they were too “intense,” too “hyper-real,” too “beautiful,” too “interactive,” and too drenched in significance for even a healthy brain to conjure. He also appears to think that despite their timeless quality, his visions could not have arisen in the minutes or hours during which his cortex (which surely never went off) switched back on. He clearly knows nothing about what people with working brains experience under the influence of psychedelics. Nor does he know that visions of the sort that McKenna describes, although they may seem to last for ages, require only a brief span of biological time. Unlike LSD and other long-acting psychedelics, DMT alters consciousness for merely a few minutes. Alexander would have had more than enough time to experience a visionary ecstasy as he was coming out of his coma (whether his cortex was rebooting or not). \n \n Does Alexander know that DMT already exists in the brain as a neurotransmitter? Did his brain experience a surge of DMT release during his coma? This is pure speculation, of course, but it is a far more credible hypothesis than that his cortex “shut down,” freeing his soul to travel to another dimension. As one of his correspondents has already informed him, similar experiences can be had with ketamine, which is a surgical anesthetic that is occasionally used to protect a traumatized brain. Did Alexander by any chance receive ketamine while in the hospital? Would he even think it relevant if he had? His assertion that psychedelics like DMT and ketamine “do not explain the kind of clarity, the rich interactivity, the layer upon layer of understanding” he experienced is perhaps the most amazing thing he has said since he returned from heaven. Such compounds are universally understood to do the job. And most scientists believe that the reliable effects of psychedelics indicate that the brain is at the very least involved in the production of visionary states of the sort Alexander is talking about. \n \n Again, there is nothing to be said against Alexander’s experience. It sounds perfectly sublime. And such ecstasies do tell us something about how good a human mind can feel. The problem is that the conclusions Alexander has drawn from his experience—he continually reminds us, as a scientist—are based on some very obvious errors in reasoning and gaps in his understanding. \n \n Let me suggest that, whether or not heaven exists, Alexander sounds precisely how a scientist should not sound when he doesn’t know what he is talking about. And his article is not the sort of thing that the editors of a once-important magazine should publish if they hope to reclaim some measure of respect for their battered brand.']",2,"– Dr. Eben Alexander held a scientific worldview until, he says, he went to heaven. As a nominal Christian—and a neurosurgeon with Harvard credentials—Alexander admits he had envied ""those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally,"" he writes at the Daily Beast. Then he contracted meningitis and slipped into a 7-day coma that shut down ""the human part of my brain, the neocortex.""

"['When Wilco\'s ace guitarist Nels Cline told The Times recently that his band leader, Jeff Tweedy, was a ""collage artist,"" one who would resurrect ""treasured items,"" Cline was talking pop structures. Yet he apparently could have been discussing an appreciation for vintage cartoons. In what\'s a rare proper music video from Wilco, which is in the midst of a three-night stand in Los Angeles this week, the band\'s ""Dawned on Me"" has been re-fashioned as a tale of love and jealously centered on Popeye the Sailor Man and his familiar cast of characters. \n \n The cartoon, a collaboration between Wilco\'s label dBpm Records and Blow Me Down! King Features, was directed by designer-branding guru Darren Romanelli. Said to be the first hand-drawn Popeye cartoon since 1987, the clip sees the popular spinach-eating sailor trying to distract the love of his life, Olive Oyl, from failling for Wilco\'s Tweedy. The girl, of course, chooses the musician (sigh). \n \n ""Dawned on Me"" is one of the more lighthearted songs on Wilco\'s new album, ""The Whole Love,"" although lyrically it has a slightly dark undercurrent in its midsection. Amid brightly colored guitar and keyboard textures, what at first appears to be a bouncy number about calling a loved one is revealed to be something a little more sinister when it\'s made clear that the couple are no longer together. \n \n But never mind all of that. There\'s a cartoon to watch:', 'Popeye meets Wilco in hand-drawn cartoon music video \n \n [Video Link] The Wilco track ""Dawned On Me"" re-imagined as a classic, early-era Popeye cartoon.

Best url ever: wilcospinach.com. \n \n A little more about how the video came to be, below, from Wilco and Romanelli... \n \n This collaboration between American icons is one of the first music videos Wilco has released since 1999 and it presents the band to the masses in a fresh, new way: as animated images, side-by-side with Popeye and his friends Olive Oyl, Swee’ Pea, Wimpy and Bluto. As one of the earliest animated characters, introduced in 1933 by Fleischer Studios, Popeye has become one of the most enduring and iconic cartoon characters of all time and is forever entwined in the evolution of animation. The music video marks the first new Popeye cartoon since “Popeye’s Voygage: The Quest for Pappy,” the 3-D CGI primetime TV special and deluxe DVD release produced by King Features Syndicate for Popeye’s 75th Anniversary in 2004. In what has become a primarily digital world, this new video marks the first hand-drawn, frame-by-frame rendering for Popeye cell animation since the Popeye and Son series from 1987. This certainly isn’t Popeye’s first foray into love territory: the Sailor Man first met his “goil,” Olive Oyl, in Elzie Crisler Seagar’s popular Thimble Theatre comic strip in the 1930s and their legendary love only grew and captivated the imagination of fans all over the world. The couple even made People Magazine’s list of the Greatest Love Stories of the 20th Century. \n \n (thanks, Tara McGinley, and Darren Romanelli!)']",2,"– If you're a fan of Wilco and/or Popeye, the band's new video for Dawned on Me is must-viewing, notes Xeni Jardin at BoingBoing.

"['Hillsboro physician Jill Russell never imagined a problem would result from mailing a refill of Adderall Jan. 6 to her daughter, Carrie, in South Korea. \n \n Carrie Russell also expected no trouble when she in turn shipped the medication routinely prescribed by U.S. doctors for attention deficit disorder to Nagoya, Japan, where she planned to teach English. \n \n But at 11 p.m. on Feb. 20, according to Russell\'s Portland-area family, five plain-clothed police officers in black suits burst into a Tokyo restaurant where the 26-year-old American was dining with friends. They took her into custody. She was taken 275 miles west to Nagoya, where she was incarcerated in a women\'s detention center outside the city. \n \n Russell, a 2012 Western Oregon University graduate, remains in jail on suspicion of smuggling amphetamines into Japan. A U.S. consular official and a Nagoya lawyer, hired by family members, have visited her. They\'ve told the family that Russell has been held in solitary confinement and subjected to numerous interrogations. \n \n ""We\'re left in a state of disbelief,"" said John Russell, Carrie\'s father, who teaches at a Portland elementary school. ""We would never imagine something like this assaulting us from a civilized country like Japan."" \n \n As Carrie Russell\'s family members work frantically for her release, her predicament serves as a warning for Americans traveling abroad. Medication routinely prescribed in the United States can be illegal in other countries, with serious consequences for possession. \n \n Russell\'s case also highlights differing U.S. and Japanese systems of criminal justice and drug enforcement, as well as contrasting attitudes toward mental health and treatment. \n \n In hindsight, warnings against bringing Adderall into Japan show up on the Internet. But they\'re difficult to find, and veteran international travelers are often unaware of foreign laws that criminalize commonly prescribed U.S. medications \n \n A traveler who scoured the Internet would find Adderall specifically cited in a parenthetical clause partway through one of several documents linked to an import-restrictions page on the Web site of the Consulate General of Japan in Seattle. \n \n ""Nobody can bring any medicine containing methamphetamine or amphetamine (Adderall and so on) into Japan,"" the document says. ""If you are found with any medicine containing methamphetamine or amphetamine illegally in Japan, you can be arrested as a criminal on the spot, immediately, without a warrant in principle."" \n \n Unwittingly, from all indications, Russell has run afoul of a hidden world of criminal gangs, drug abusers, police and jails seldom encountered even by long-term foreign residents of Japan. \n \n During World War II, the Japanese government gave amphetamines to soldiers and arms-factory workers. They used the stimulants, known as speed, to remain on duty for long hours. \n \n After Japan\'s defeat, looters broke into military depots, stealing and selling large amounts of amphetamines. Japanese used them to suppress hunger during early days of the U.S. Occupation. In the 1950s, Japan outlawed amphetamines. The Yakuza, Japan\'s main organized-crime syndicate, muscled into the lucrative black market, which it still controls. \n \n Amphetamines remain the illicit drugs of choice in fast-paced Japan, partly because authorities have managed until recently to keep out many other illegal substances common in the West. White-collar workers use speed to toil long hours. Students take it to pull all-nighters. Truck drivers rely on it to stay awake. \n \n Illicit Adderall is common as well in the United State, where college students take it to get through exams. But U.S. doctors find the medication effective for treating attention deficit disorder. \n \n In Japan, arrested amphetamine addicts have often ended up in psychiatric hospitals resembling jails. A 1996 ABC Australia documentary reported that many inmates were heavily sedated and given shock therapy. \n \n Mental illness is stigmatized more in Japan than in other countries, according to Japanese researchers. While awareness is growing, mental conditions often go undiagnosed. Ritalin, the other main drug used in the West to treat attention deficit disorder, was banned in 2007 by Japanese government officials who cited widespread abuse. \n \n Japan has some of the world\'s toughest drug laws. Police announce frequent amphetamine busts. Therefore the idea that Adderall might have some legitimate medical use elsewhere strikes Japanese officers as far-fetched. \n \n Most amphetamines are smuggled into Japan, which is why Customs inspectors search for them, especially in shipments from the Korean peninsula. It didn\'t help Russell that her 180 generic 20-milligram pills were repackaged - apparently in an old Tylenol bottle, instead of the original prescription container -- increasing officials\' suspicions. \n \n Jill Russell said she originally sent the three-month supply of pills that way to her daughter for two reasons. \n \n First, as a physician who often prescribes Adderall, she routinely advises patients to consider keeping pills in unmarked containers because prescription bottles attract burglars, due to the substance\'s high street value. She advises against carrying the medication in a car or purse, and to consider keeping it in a locked safe. \n \n Second, knowing of the stigma in Japan concerning mental disorders, she didn\'t want Carrie Russell\'s reputation to suffer in case someone opening her household shipments noticed the medication. \n \n ""My repackaging was not an attempt to break or circumvent the law,"" Jill Russell wrote in a sworn affidavit sent Feb. 25 to Japanese police. ""It was intended to preserve Carrie\'s privacy and dignity around a sensitive issue regarding medication to treat a disorder which falls under the area of mental health."" \n \n In a second affidavit sent Feb. 26, Jill Russell added: ""At the time this medication was shipped, I did not know that later Carrie would be fortunate enough to be hired to teach in Japan, thus resulting in her move to Japan and the need to ship her belongings to Japan."" \n \n So far, the affidavits haven\'t swayed the police or prosecutor on the case. Neither have Jill Russell\'s answers to police officers during three phone calls from Japan, each lasting more than an hour. Officers also questioned Carrie\'s physician, Michelle Mears, by phone. \n \n Officers said that under Japanese law, Carrie Russell can be jailed for as many as 23 days before being charged. If found guilty of smuggling amphetamines, she could be sentenced to years in prison. \n \n Family members have worked on the case since Feb. 21, when Russell\'s father received word of Carrie\'s arrest from one of her friends. Russell\'s stepfather, Portland lawyer Loren Podwill, immediately contacted the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to find out where she was. \n \n It took U.S. diplomats 24 hours to locate her. The National Police Agency hadn\'t notified the embassy of her arrest, a step normally taken when Japanese police apprehend an American. \n \n Family members worry that Carrie Russell might buckle under the relentless interrogations - at which she has no lawyer present - and confess to a crime she didn\'t commit. \n \n Interventions by congressional staff members including those of Oregon\'s Democratic U.S. senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., have also failed so far to secure Russell\'s release. But the staff members continued working angles in Tokyo and Washington, D.C., over the weekend at all hours in hopes of a diplomatic solution. \n \n On Thursday, Podwill wrote a heartfelt letter to the prosecutor in Nagoya. He described the background and character of the girl whom Jill and John Russell adopted at infancy from a Guatemalan birth mother. \n \n Podwill described Carrie Russell\'s success in life through hard work and dedication despite the challenges she has faced since 7, when diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. \n \n He noted his stepdaughter\'s volunteer work at a school for the deaf. He cited her work during three college summers in Japan and Germany, teaching children of military personnel. Russell had taught English in South Korea for the last two years. \n \n ""Like her dad,"" Podwill wrote, ""she has a passion for working with children and teaching, which is what brought her to South Korea two years ago and to her new job in Japan, which she is supposed to start in a few weeks."" \n \n Podwill wrote in terms that a Japanese might understand. He asked the prosecutor to accept the family\'s sincerest apologies. He said that no one intended to ignore or break Japanese law. \n \n ""That\'s not who we are,"" Podwill wrote. ""That\'s not who Carrie is. She made a mistake. Jill made a mistake."" \n \n ""Carrie has been humiliated and punished enough for that mistake, which she will never make again."" \n \n rread@oregonian.com \n \n 503-294-5135 @ReadOregonian', 'Your Health \n \n Neurologists Warn Against ADHD Drugs To Help Kids Study \n \n itoggle caption Jb Reed/Bloomberg via Getty Images \n \n Adderall and other ADHD medications are among the most prescribed drugs in America. \n \n Quite a few of those pills don\'t end up being used to treat ADHD, though. They\'re used as ""smart drugs"" or ""study drugs"" by students who find the pills give them a mental edge. \n \n The American Academy of Neurology now says: Stop that. \n \n The brain docs are directing that advice first and foremost to their fellow physicians, the ones who have been writing all those scrips for people who don\'t have ADHD, or who perhaps don\'t think about all the pills their patients sell on the student black market. \n \n ""We don\'t believe that doctors are supposed to be drug dispensers for healthy people,"" says William Graf, a professor of pediatrics and neurology at the Yale School of Medicine. ""This is an ethics issue."" \n \n But the message is also being sent to teenagers and their parents, some of whom who might think that giving their child a little leg up for a big test isn\'t such a bad thing. The buzz term for that? ""Pediatric neuroenhancement."" \n \n Prescribing ADHD drugs to children who don\'t have the disorder is ""not justifiable,"" according to the American Academy of Neurology\'s new position paper. That\'s because children\'s brains are still developing, the paper says, and they don\'t have the ability to weigh the risks and benefits of medication. \n \n Prescribing study drugs is ""inadvisable"" in teenagers, the Academy said, a word chosen to reflect both teenagers\' growing autonomy, and the fact that the Academy can\'t tell doctors what drugs they can and can\'t prescribe. \n \n The number of children diagnosed with ADHD rose 24 percent from 2001 to 2011, according to a study published earlier this year. Over the same time, the number of prescriptions for Adderall and other ADHD drugs has soared exponentially. \n \n More pills in circulation means more pills that can be bought, borrowed, or snitched. Various surveys report that 8 to 35 percent of college students say they have used stimulant pills to improve school performance. \n \n The neurologists are not saying that stimulant drugs shouldn\'t be used to treat ADHD, which is characterized by problems with attention and hyperactivity. ""We\'re not touching that here,"" Graf told Shots. \n \n What they are saying is that doctors have a moral obligation to protect the best interests of the child — who doesn\'t yet have legal control over health care decisions — and to prevent the misuse of medication. \n \n Amphetamines like Adderall and Vyvanse can be addictive, which is why they\'re classified as Schedule II controlled substances, along with Oxycontin and morphine. Side effects can be as simple as insomnia, or as serious as sudden high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and seizures. \n \n Other popular ADHD drugs like Concerta and Ritalin are methlphenidates, and are considered less risky. But they can cause a wide range of side effects including insomnia, aggression, mood and behavior changes, twitching, and shaking. \n \n About 15 percent of 12th graders say they misuse prescription drugs, according to the 2012 Monitoring the Future survey, and about 6 percent say they\'ve misused Ritalin or Adderall. Adderall is the only drug class that showed increased use in 2012, the federal survey reported. \n \n ""As a society we have a pill for everything,"" Graf says. ""It\'s one thing if you\'re taking something from the Vitamin Shoppe. It\'s another thing if you\'re talking about amphetamines."" \n \n Doctors should talk with patients and parents about why they feel the need for academic performance enhancing drugs, Graf says. Then they should point out that there are other ways to deal with competition and anxiety. \n \n ""We have to get back to the basics,"" Graf says. ""Sleep, exercise, and social interaction.""']",2,"– Carrie Russell apparently thought little of shipping her Adderall to Japan before moving there to teach English. But Japanese police saw it differently, arresting the 26-year-old American last month for allegedly smuggling illegal amphetamines into Japan, the Oregonian reports. ""We're left in a state of disbelief,"" says her dad, a Portland teacher. ""We would never imagine something like this assaulting us from a civilized country like Japan."" But Adderall is strictly illegal there, and police can hold Russell for up to 23 days without charging her. Meanwhile, her family, US politicians, and even her doctor are trying to get her out of a possible years-long prison sentence—for carrying a drug that's one of America's most widely prescribed, NPR reports. Trouble is, Japan's drug laws are among the world's toughest. The country routinely announces busts of amphetamines, which Yakuza crime syndicates smuggle into Japan for those who pull long hours, like white-collar workers, students, and truck drivers. Another problem: Russell's mom sent her the prescription in an old Tylenol bottle, which created the appearance of smuggling. She says she did it to ward off thieves and avoid identifying Russell's illness—attention deficit disorder—in a country where mental illness is stigmatized. But warnings against taking Adderall to Japan do exist online, and so far Japanese authorities haven't budged. ""She made a mistake,"" her stepfather wrote Japanese prosecutors. ""Carrie has been humiliated and punished enough for that mistake, which she will never make again."" (A tourist was once jailed in Dubai after reporting a rape.)"
"['This image show the mummy of an ancient Egyptian man in his 50s who had rectal cancer. \n \n Archaeologists have uncovered six cases of cancer while studying the bodies of ancient Egyptians who were buried long ago in the Dakhleh Oasis. The finds include a toddler with leukemia, a mummified man in his 50s with rectal cancer and individuals with cancer possibly caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). \n \n The researchers found these cancer cases while examining the remains of 1,087 ancient Egyptians buried between 3,000 and 1,500 years ago. \n \n Extrapolating from these cases, the researchers estimated that the lifetime cancer risk in the ancient Dakhleh Oasis was about 5 in 1,000, compared with 50 percent in modern Western societies, wrote El Molto and Dr. Peter Sheldrick in a paper published in a special cancer issue of the International Journal of Paleopathology. ""Thus, the lifetime cancer risk in today\'s Western societies is 100 times greater than in ancient Dakhleh,"" they wrote. [Photos: Ancient Egyptian Cemetery with 1 Million Mummies] \n \n Molto, a retired anthropology professor at Western University in Ontario, Canada, cautioned that some people living at Dakhleh could have died of cancer without any traces being left in their remains and that people in the ancient world tended to have shorter life spans than people today. However, even accounting for these factors, the researchers believe the risk of cancer was considerably lower in ancient Egypt. \n \n In five of the six cases, scientists determined that they had cancer by studying lesions (holes and bone damage) on their skeletons. Those holes were left when cancer spread throughout their bodies. For instance, a woman in her 40s or 50s had a hole on her right hip bone that is about 2.4 inches (6.2 cm) in size that researchers believe was caused by a tumor. In one case (the man in his 50s with rectal cancer), an actual tumor was preserved. Researchers cannot be certain where the cancers originated in many of the cases. \n \n Three of the six cases (two females and one male) were people in their 20s or 30s, an age when it is rare for people to get cancer, the researchers said. \n \n An ancient Egyptian woman in her 20s suffered from cancer that had spread to her skull. She may have had the HPV virus, researchers believe. Credit: Image courtesy El Molto \n \n ""When the Dakhleh cases were first presented at professional meetings, a common comment against accepting the diagnosis of cancer was that \'their ages were too young,\'"" wrote Molto and Sheldrick, a physician in Chatham, Ontario, in their paper, referring to the three young adults. [Image Gallery: Digging Up a Cemetery in Dakhleh Oasis] \n \n However, recent research has revealed that HPV is a major cause of several forms of cancer, including those that often affect young adults. ""HPV is a confirmed cause of cancer of the uterine cervix and testes, and it evolved in Africa long before Homo sapiens emerged,"" wrote Molto and Sheldrick in their paper. \n \n ""The two female and the male burials from Dakhleh, all young adults, could have, respectively, developed cancer of the uterine cervix and testicular cancer,"" the authors wrote. ""We know from current cancer epidemiology research that both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts."" \n \n While scientists were not able to genetically test the three young adults to see if they had HPV, other studies confirm that it did exist in the ancient world, Molto and Sheldrick wrote, noting that the virus likely existed in the ancient Dakhleh Oasis. \n \n So far, research into Egyptian medical texts and human remains have revealed no indication that the ancient Egyptians had a specific treatment for cancer. \n \n This image shows an ancient Egyptian child from the Dakhleh Oasis who was between 3 and 5 years old at death. This child died of leukemia, research indicates. His bones were riddled with holes caused by the disease. Credit: Image courtesy El Molto \n \n ""They knew that something nasty was going on,"" Molto told Live Science. However, ""we have no indication as to specific treatments for cancer, because they didn\'t understand [what cancer was],"" Molto said, adding that the ancient Egyptians may have tried to treat some of the symptoms such as skin ulcers. \n \n The researchers said they hope that in the future, data will be gathered on cancer and other diseases in the modern-day Dakhleh Oasis. This data could then be compared to the ancient rate to provide more clues as to how the risk of cancer has changed over time. \n \n Originally published on Live Science.', 'Bones bearing signs of cancer found in an ancient Egyptian cemetery reveal that the often devastating disease is much more prevalent now than it was in the people who lived near the Dakhleh Oasis. \n \n Out of 1,087 skeletons buried between 1,500 and 3,000 years ago, just 6 were found with cancer - two younger women with cervical cancer, and a man with testicular cancer, which have all been associated with HPV; and an older mummified man with colorectal cancer, an older woman with metastatic carcinoma, and a toddler with leukaemia. \n \n That\'s a rate of 5 cases in 1,000 - compared to today, where the cancer rate in Western societies approaches 500 per 1,000 people - a lifetime cancer risk 100 times greater than what it was in the ancient Dakhleh in Egypt\'s Western Desert. \n \n Because soft tissue doesn\'t often survive millennia, the researchers looked for the traces cancer leaves on bone. \n \n Lesions found on the skeletons were consistent with carcinoma, and, although it\'s difficult to diagnose based simply on bones, the researchers were able to determine the most likely types based on the distribution and types of legion, as well as the age and sex of the person. \n \n Three of them - two women and a man - fell outside the normal age range, dying in their 20s and 30s. \n \n ""When the Dakhleh cases were first presented at professional meetings a common comment against accepting the diagnosis of cancer was that \'their ages were too young\'!"" the researchers, anthropologist El Molto of The University of Western Ontario and Ontario physician Peter Sheldrick, wrote in their paper. \n \n But the 25-30-year-old male was likely afflicted with testicular cancer, since that age is the highest risk group, and the two young women were most likely afflicted by cervical cancer. \n \n Both of these types of cancer are linked with HPV, recent research has found (although its implication in testicular cancer is rare) - and HPV has been around for a very long time, much longer than the age of the bones. \n \n And all strains of the virus evolved in Africa. \n \n ""The two female and the male burials from Dakhleh, all young adults, could have respectively developed cancer of the uterine cervix and testicular cancer,"" Molto and Sheldrick wrote. \n \n ""We know from current cancer epidemiology research that both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts and the HPV risk factor would have likely been present the paleoecology of ancient Dakhleh."" \n \n Interestingly, the older male mummy had soft tissue preserved, including a tumour. This meant that a full autopsy and tissue analysis could be performed, positively identifying rectal adenocarcinoma. \n \n The older woman most likely had ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer; and the child, in whom almost every single bone showed signs of a systemic disease, probably had acute leukaemia, given its prevalence among that age group. \n \n There are some caveats guiding estimates of the prevalence of cancer in ancient Egypt. Firstly, the average lifespan was shorter - only 7.7 percent of the ancient Dakhlans were estimated to be over 60 years of age, the researchers said. \n \n Given that a quarter of new cancer cases are diagnosed between the ages of 65 and 74, according to the US National Cancer Council, this shorter lifespan could impact lifetime cancer risk. \n \n Another factor that could affect results is the relative lack of soft tissue. Cancer doesn\'t always leave a mark on bones, so there could have been some cases among the 1,087 skeletons that the researchers missed. \n \n Even accounting for these caveats, however, Molto and Sheldrick believe that the prevalence of cancer was still at least 50 times lower in ancient Dakhleh. \n \n ""In our opinion, it is doubtful that even if the ancient Dakhlans had the same life expectancy as modern western societies the rate of cancer would have been equivalent,"" they wrote in their paper. \n \n ""The carcinogenic load in their past environments would have been considerably less carcinogenic than modern western societies."" \n \n The research has been published in the International Journal of Paleopathology.']",2,"– Diagnoses have just been made for patients who've been dead for thousands of years. Researchers digging in Egypt have uncovered six cases of cancer among ancient Egyptians, including a young child with leukemia, a middle-aged woman with a carcinoma—most likely ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer—and a middle-aged man with a preserved tumor indicating rectal cancer, per Live Science and ScienceAlert. Based on those and three other cancer cases perhaps caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), found among the remains of 1,087 Egyptians buried 1,500 to 3,000 years ago in a cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis, researchers say ancient residents had a 0.5% risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes, compared to the ""100 times greater"" risk of 50% for people living in the West today. In most cases, researchers had to identify cancers based on bone damage, including holes left by tumors, and admit traces of disease could've long ago vanished. Still, the finding makes sense since ancient Egyptians had significantly shorter life spans than modern humans (which would affect lifetime cancer risk) and ""the carcinogenic load in their past environments would have been considerably less carcinogenic than modern Western societies,"" anthropologist El Molto and doctor Peter Sheldrick write in the International Journal of Paleopathology. As three of the six cases occurred in people who died relatively young, in their 20s and 30s, the pair suspect HPV could be to blame. ""HPV is a confirmed cause of cancer of the uterine cervix and testes"" and ""both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts,"" write the authors, who found no evidence of cancer treatment.

"['The cabin of a Qatar Airways plane. AP American Airlines on Thursday said it received an unsolicited notice from Qatar Airways of its intention to make a ""significant investment."" \n \n In a conversation between the CEOs of both companies, Qatar Airways said it wanted to buy about 10% of public shares, American Airlines said in a regulatory filing . \n \n Qatar Airways filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, as required for its proposed investment of at least $808 million, American Airlines said. It added that anyone who wanted to buy over 4.75% of the company must gain board approval but that it hadn\'t received such a request. \n \n ""The proposed investment by Qatar Airways was not solicited by American Airlines and would in no way change the company\'s board composition, governance, management or strategic direction,"" American Airlines said. \n \n The carrier added that it remained committed to pursuing fair competition with airlines based in Gulf nations. US airlines have raised concerns that the subsidies that Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, and Emirates receive from their home countries create unfair competition and could squeeze them out of key markets. \n \n Earlier in June, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern neighbors cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The countries also closed their airspace to Qatar Airways, which could be devastating because Qatar has very little airspace relative to its size. \n \n The airline said in April that it had seen a drop in bookings because of the US and UK governments\' ban on large electronics in the cabins of certain international flights. \n \n American Airlines shares gained about 6% in premarket trading.', 'American Airlines is not happy with Qatar Airways\' intent to invest. \n \n American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sent a letter to employees on Thursday in response to Qatar Airways announcing their offer to acquire a 10 percent stake in the company. \n \n In the letter, Parker uses the word ""puzzling"" to describe Qatar Airways\' intention to invest and specifically points out ""illegal subsidies"" as the reason behind his criticism. \n \n ""While anyone can purchase our shares in the open market, we aren\'t particularly excited about Qatar\'s outreach, and we find it puzzling given our extremely public stance on the illegal subsidies that Qatar, Emirates and Etihad have all received over the years from their governments,"" Parker wrote. \n \n Parker, a longtime critic of Gulf carriers such as Qatar, continued by saying the company is still maintaining efforts to stand against illegally subsidized companies. \n \n ""While today\'s news for some of our team may be puzzling, at best, and concerning, at worst, here\'s what we know for sure: We will not be discouraged or dissuaded from our full court press in Washington, D.C., to stand up to companies that are illegally subsidized by their governments,"" Parker wrote.', 'American Airlines is no fan of the world’s favorite airline, Qatar Airways. The feeling isn’t mutual. \n \n The gulf carrier says it is seeking a stake as large as 10% in American, the world’s largest carrier by traffic. It’s a new twist in the battle between US carriers and their Gulf rivals. US airlines have long protested that Middle Eastern counterparts Qatar, Emirates, and Etihad receive subsidies from their governments that allow them to compete unfairly. Those complaints were recently brought to the Trump administration. \n \n In a letter to employees, American’s chief executive, Doug Parker, said that rival Qatar Airways’ plan was “puzzling given our extremely public stance on the illegal subsidies” that American alleges Qatar Airways and the other two gulf carriers receive. \n \n Government-owned Qatar Airways has been embroiled in its own troubles, such as the US electronics ban, and a diplomatic crisis with its neighbors that allege Qatar supports terrorism, which the country denies. Its neighbors have closed their airspace to Qatari planes. \n \n Earlier this week, Qatar Airways won the top spot from travelers in airline-analysis firm Skytrax’s world airline awards, which it dubs “the Oscars of the aviation industry.” American ranked 74th, up from 77th a year ago. \n \n Despite its plush cabins Qatar Airways is tiny compared with American and other competitors.

But the company’s board will have to approve any stake larger than 4.75%, and foreign voting interest is capped at 24.9%.

Quartz notes that the airline is small in comparison to US airlines and has been purchasing stakes in foreign airlines recently to beef up. In his letter Parker, attempts to allay any fear that the potential new investor could influence the airline.

"['The Bluefin-21 underwater vehicle is hoisted back aboard the Australian ship Ocean Shield after successful buoyancy testing in the Indian Ocean. (U.S. Navy / Getty Images / ) \n \n BEIJING -- An unmanned underwater vehicle will be deployed to look for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on the floor of the Indian Ocean, Australian authorities said Monday, and investigators have collected samples from an oil slick discovered in the search area. \n \n With six days having passed with no further detection of “pings” from what may have been the plane’s black boxes, searchers on the Australian ship Ocean Shield will cease using the U.S. Navy’s towed pinger locator and deploy the Bluefin-21 underwater search vessel, officials said. \n \n “It is time to go underwater,” said Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is coordinating the search from Perth, Australia. \n \n The Bluefin-21, Houston said, will search an area of about 15 square miles on its first 24-hour mission. It takes two hours to get to the sea floor and will search for 16 hours. It takes another two hours to bring the Bluefin-21 to the surface and four hours to download and analyze the data it has collected. The Bluefin-21, which moves at a walking pace, produces a high-resolution, 3-D map of the sea floor. \n \n Meanwhile, searchers will work to send the oil slick sample, collected Sunday evening, to a laboratory on shore for analysis, Houston said. “We don’t think it’s from the ships” involved in the search, he said. \n \n Monday marked day 38 of the search for the Boeing 777, which disappeared March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard. The aircraft’s black box batteries have a guaranteed shelf life of 30 days, so hope is dwindling that further transmissions from the transponders will be detected. Four acoustic signals were earlier picked up by the towed pinger locator. \n \n Houston said the air and surface search for floating debris in the area where the plane “most likely” entered the water would be concluded within two to three days. After that, he suggested, the countries involved in the search would need to consult with one another and determine how to proceed. No debris has been found. \n \n Eleven military planes, one civil aircraft and 15 ships were participating in Monday’s search about 1,300 miles northwest of Perth. \n \n The ocean where investigators believe the plane went down is extremely deep -- 2.8 miles -- and not much detail is known about the terrain. This is an area, Houston said, that is “new to man.” \n \n Asked if other underwater vehicles besides the Bluefin-21 would be joining the search, Houston indicated that investigators had no plans at this point. However, he indicated that if the depth of the ocean proves to exceed 2.8 miles, a different type of vehicle will be necessary because the Bluefin-21 cannot go deeper than that. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Crowds flood Vatican City for dual papal canonization \n \n U.S., allies to add sanctions against Russia over Ukraine \n \n Runoff set for June 7 to settle Afghanistan presidential election \n \n julie.makinen@latimes.com \n \n Twitter: @JulieMakLAT', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ACM Angus Houston: Bluefin-21 will create a 3D map of the ocean floor \n \n Teams searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane are to deploy a robotic submarine for the first time. \n \n Search chief Angus Houston said the Bluefin-21 drone would be sent down as soon as possible to search for wreckage on the sea floor. \n \n Teams have been using a towed pinger locator to listen for signals from the plane\'s ""black box"" flight recorders. \n \n But no new signals have been heard since 8 April, amid concerns the flight recorders\' batteries have expired. \n \n Flight MH370 went missing on 8 March with 239 people on board.

But I do not want to speculate on that at the moment."" \n \n U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told CNN they have been told that no other cell phones were picked up by the Penang tower. \n \n Pilots are supposed to turn off their cell phones before pushing back from the gate. \n \n ""It would be very rare in my opinion to have someone with a cell phone on in the cockpit,"" safety analyst David Soucie said. ""It\'s never supposed to be on at all. It\'s part of every check list of every airline I am familiar with."" \n \n When the plane first went missing, authorities said millions of cell phone records were searched, looking for evidence that calls had been made from the plane after it took off, but the search turned up nothing. \n \n Underwater search is shortened \n \n Efforts to find the missing plane and the 239 people aboard were focused beneath the choppy surface of the southern Indian Ocean on Monday as Australian authorities sent a U.S. Navy-contracted submersible diving toward the sea floor. \n \n But after completing just six hours of searching for underwater debris, the autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 returned to the surface, according to the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in Perth, Australia. \n \n It should have taken the probe and its operators 24 hours to map the first portion of the search area: 16 hours to map, four hours\' travel time to just above the ocean floor and back, and four hours for analysts to examine the data gathered. \n \n It is unclear how much of the area -- 5 kilometers by 8 kilometers (3.1 miles by 4.9 miles) -- the Bluefin scanned. It could take up to two months to scan the entire search area. \n \n Officials said a built-in safety feature recalled the underwater search vehicle after it exceeded its operating depth of 4,500 meters (14,763 feet). \n \n Capt. Mark Matthews, who heads the U.S. presence in the search effort, said the Bluefin aborted so the crew could refine the mission parameters. Charts indicated the ocean was at most 4,400 meters (14,436 feet) deep, so when the Bluefin went deeper than that, it was returned to the surface. \n \n ""It happened in the very far corner of the area it\'s searching, so they are just shifting the search box a little bit away from that deep water and proceeding with the search,"" he told CNN\'s ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" \n \n The decision to put the Bluefin-21 into the water for the first time in the 38-day search comes nearly a week after listening devices last heard sounds that could be from locator beacons attached to the plane\'s ""black boxes."" \n \n ""We haven\'t had a single detection in six days,"" Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said. ""It\'s time to go underwater."" \n \n The probe is equipped with side-scan sonar -- acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound. Such technology is routinely used to find sunken ships and was crucial in finding Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. \n \n Photos: The search for MH370 Photos: The search for MH370 Two years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, a relative of one of the passengers burns incense in Beijing on March 8, 2016.

""']",3,"– After six days with no fresh pings detected, the chief of the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 says it's time to go underwater. The Bluefin-21 underwater autonomous vehicle will now be deployed to search for wreckage in an area defined by signals picked up last week that are believed to have been from the missing jet's data recorders, reports the BBC. Search chief Angus Houston says the robotic sub will be in a ""reduced and manageable search area on the ocean floor"" and, with the data recorders' batteries now almost certainly dead, efforts to detect pings will cease. On its first 24-hour mission, the Bluefin-21 will search an area of around 15 square miles, producing a high-resolution map of the sea floor, the Los Angeles Times reports. Houston warns, however, that the underwater search will be a ""slow and painstaking process"" with no guarantee of results. The area being searched, he says, is extremely deep—2.8 miles—and is largely unknown terrain ""new to man."" An oil slick detected on the surface of the area last night, meanwhile, is being analyzed and officials believe it didn't come from any of the search vessels, CNN reports."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Ken Dilanian, Peter Alexander. and Courtney Kube \n \n Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and one of his senior advisers, has come under FBI scrutiny in the Russia investigation, multiple U.S. officials told NBC News. \n \n Investigators believe Kushner has significant information relevant to their inquiry, officials said. That does not mean they suspect him of a crime or intend to charge him. \n \n The FBI’s scrutiny of Kushner places the bureau’s sprawling counterintelligence and criminal investigation not only on the doorstep of the White House, but the Trump family circle. The Washington Post first reported last week that a senior White House official close to Trump was a ""person of interest,"" but did not name the person. The term ""person of interest"" has no legal meaning. \n \n The officials said Kushner is in a different category from former Trump aides Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who are formally considered subjects of the investigation. According to the Justice Department\'s U.S. Attorneys\' Manual, ""A \'subject\' of an investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury\'s investigation."" \n \n Records of both Manafort and Flynn have been demanded by grand jury subpoenas, NBC News has reported. \n \n Related: Feds Subpoena Records for $3.5M Mystery Mortgage on Manafort\'s Home \n \n It is not known whether Kushner has received any records requests from federal investigators. \n \n Also unclear is what precisely about Kushner’s activities has drawn the FBI’s interest as it investigates whether Trump associates coordinated with the Russian campaign to interfere in the election. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is now leading the probe as a special counsel. \n \n Kushner met at least once in December with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and he also met last year with a Russian banker, Sergey Gorkov. \n \n Related: Flynn, Manafort Are Key Figures in Russia Probe That Mueller Will Lead \n \n “Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings,"" Kushner\'s lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told NBC News. ""He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry."" \n \n Congressional aides have said they would like to question Kushner about that meeting, and Kushner has said he would voluntarily appear before the Senate intelligence committee as part of its Russia investigation. \n \n Gorkov is chairman of VneshEconomBank, a Russian government-owned institution that has been under U.S. sanctions since July 2014. Gorkov studied at the training school for the FSB, one of Russia’s intelligence services. \n \n Kushner, whose family’s real estate empire is worth $1.8 billion, according to Forbes, wields significant power in the White House. He is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka.', 'The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is calling for the suspension of Jared Kushner’s security clearance while the senior White House adviser is under FBI scrutiny. \n \n “The FBI’s Russia investigation reached Trump’s backyard, and now it’s in his house,” DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson said in a statement Thursday. “Kushner’s security clearance should be suspended until the FBI’s findings are complete.” \n \n NBC News on Thursday reported that Kushner has come under scrutiny in the FBI’s investigation of possible collusion between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. \n \n The FBI’s focus on Kushner does not mean he is suspected of a crime or considered a subject of the bureau’s wider probe of Russian election meddling last year. \n \n Kushner’s attorney on Thursday said that top Trump administration official would cooperate on any probes of his past meetings with Russians. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n “Mr. Kushner previously volunteered with Congress what he knows about these meetings,” Jamie Gorelick said in a statement. “He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry” \n \n The Washington Post on Thursday reported that investigators are instead examining Kushner’s meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and a Russian banking executive late last year.

He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry,"" the statement said. \n \n Meanwhile, the chairman of the House oversight committee asked the FBI to turn over more documents about former Director James Comey\'s interactions with the White House and Justice Department, including materials dating back nearly four years to the Obama administration. \n \n The FBI and the oversight committee — as well as several other congressional panels — are looking into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign. Trump fired Comey May 9 amid questions about the FBI\'s investigation, which is now being overseen by special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director. \n \n NBC News and The Washington Post first reported that the FBI\'s ongoing investigation includes a look at Kushner, which would place the probe inside the White House. \n \n Kushner, a key White House adviser, had meetings late last year with Russia\'s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, and Russian banker Sergey Gorkov. \n \n The Post story cited anonymous ""people familiar with the investigation,"" who said the FBI investigation does not mean that Kushner is suspected of a crime. \n \n Earlier Thursday, House oversight committee chairman Jason Chaffetz told acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe that he wants records of Comey\'s contacts with the White House and Justice Department dating to September 2013, when Comey was sworn in as FBI director under President Barack Obama. \n \n In a letter to McCabe, Chaffetz said he is seeking to review Comey\'s memos and other written materials so he can ""better understand"" Comey\'s communications with the White House and attorney general\'s office. \n \n Chaffetz, R-Utah, previously requested Comey\'s recent memos about his private contacts with Trump. But the bureau told him Thursday it could not yet turn them over because of Mueller\'s probe. \n \n Chaffetz, who said last week he has his ""subpoena pen"" ready to force Comey or the FBI to turn over the documents, told McCabe that ""Congress and the American public have a right and a duty to examine this issue independently of the special counsel\'s investigation."" \n \n He added, in a thinly veiled threat, ""I trust and hope you understand this and make the right decision — to produce these documents to the committee immediately and on a voluntary basis."" \n \n Chaffetz\'s letter comes a month before he is scheduled to leave office after abruptly announcing his resignation earlier this year. He canceled a hearing scheduled Wednesday after Comey declined to testify. \n \n Assistant FBI Director Gregory Brower told Chaffetz on Thursday the agency is evaluating his request and will update him as soon as possible. \n \n Some Republican members of Congress have pressured Chaffetz to step down from the Comey probe, saying it should be led by someone who will remain in Congress. \n \n Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., is considered the front-runner to replace Chaffetz as oversight chair. Gowdy led a special House panel that spent more than two years investigating the deadly 2012 attacks at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.']",5,"– Jared Kushner will be cooperating with any probe of Russian links to his father-in-law's campaign, a lawyer confirmed Thursday after reports that investigators are focusing on the senior White House adviser surfaced. Attorney Jamie Gorelick said Kushner has already offered to tell Congress all about his meetings with Russian officials and he will do the same ""if contacted in connection with any other inquiry."" Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that federal investigators have been looking into Kushner's Russian contacts for months, though he has not yet been contacted by the FBI. In other coverage: Sources tell NBC News that investigators believe Kushner has information that could be very useful to the Russia investigation, though he's not personally suspected of wrongdoing. Kushner met Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Russian banker Sergey Gorkov last year. Democrats are calling for Kushner's White House security clearance to be pulled, the Hill reports. ""The FBI's Russia investigation reached Trump's backyard, and now it's in his house,"" DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson said in a statement. ""Kushner's security clearance should be suspended until the FBI's findings are complete."" Investigators are also looking into possible financial crimes, according to the Telegraph, though the Justice Department isn't providing details. ""I can't confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of investigations or subjects of investigations,"" spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said. While much is still unclear, there will be plenty of people saying ""I told you so"" if corruption allegations involving Kushner surface, according to Aaron Blake at the Washington Post. Trump's hiring of a family member for a senior White House role was strongly criticized, and ""as any expert on corrupt authoritarian regimes throughout history will tell you, those regimes' wrongdoing will often run through family members with official titles,"" he writes. In a separate development linked to the Russia investigation, House Oversight Committee chief Rep. Jason Chaffetz said he wants to review former FBI Director James Comey's contacts with the White House and Justice Department going all the way back to 2013, the AP reports. He told acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe that he wants to ""better understand"" Comey's interactions with the White House. Chaffetz announced his surprise resignation last week, and Republicans are pushing to have him replaced by somebody who will be in office for longer."

"['This collection contains collaborative Election crawls performed by IA.', 'President Obama has just completed the most arduous act of community organizing of his career. Two hundred and nineteen of his neighbors down the street joined together in the House of Representatives to pass historic health care legislation. Speaker Nancy Pelosi made it happen, but Obama worked harder and more intensely than he has on any other issue of his presidency. He made 92 direct pitches to Democratic members of the House, according to a White House tally. Last week he gave three speeches, culminating in an appeal to fellow Democrats more personal and philosophical than any he\'s given since taking office. \n \n This week the legislation goes to the Senate, where it will be difficult for Republicans to derail the bill (though they might be able to delay it). \n \n ""We rose above the weight of our politics. ... We are still a people capable of doing big things,"" said the president. ""I know this wasn\'t an easy vote for a lot of people but it was the right vote."" \n \n No matter what happens next, Obama\'s sucessful effort to reshape the country\'s social safety net is a turning point in his presidency. This is his project. Unlike the bailout of the auto companies or the stimulus package, health care reform was not a response to an emergency. Whether the Obama presidency is a diptych, triptych, or something even more complex, the first hinge will mark the time before health care and the time after health care. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Obama didn\'t just work harder to clear this hurdle. He worked deeper, making his final pitch to provide insurance to 32 million people on moral grounds in a more focused way than he has in the last year of debate. Twice this past week he went to the presidential library for moral ballast. On Friday he quoted Teddy Roosevelt: ""Aggressively fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world affords."" On Saturday he built his speech to House Democrats around a quote from Lincoln that touched on the same sentiment—doing the right thing despite the odds. ""I am not bound to win, but I\'m bound to be true. I\'m not bound to succeed, but I\'m bound to live up to what light I have."" \n \n Presidents like to compare themselves to their successful predecessors. It adds to the nobility of their cause and allows them to bask in their reflected glory. But it was clear that when Obama spoke to House Democrats, he was not just reaching for rhetorical tricks. He spoke in personal terms and at length about their collective moral obligation. \n \n He talked about the impulse that moved them all to get into politics and that made them become Democrats. ""Something inspired you to get involved, and something inspired you to be a Democrat instead of running as a Republican,"" he said. ""Because somewhere deep in your heart you said to yourself, \'I believe in an America in which we don\'t just look out for ourselves, that we don\'t just tell people you\'re on your own.\' "" \n \n The push to pass this bill has not only pushed him to use all of the tools of his office—speeches to the public, town halls with members of Congress, addresses to joint sessions of Congress, Q&A sessions shown over the Internet, Air Force One trips for undecided lawmakers, hours of one-on-one cajoling—but it has also pushed him rhetorically. It\'s one thing to say Republicans aren\'t participating in the health care process. The argument Obama made Saturday went further. As Obama framed it, only Democrats care about those less fortunate. \n \n The president continued his personal pitch, empathizing with lawmakers who had sacrificed so much for their office but often felt empty for the sacrifice. Tallying up all the promises lawmakers have made during their careers, Obama offered this one redeeming act to counter the feelings of emptiness: ""Every single one of you have made that promise not just to your constituents but to yourself. And this is the time to make true on that promise.""', 'Obama\'s Place In History \n \n Let me offer a ludicrously premature opinion: Barack Obama has sealed his reputation as a president of great historical import. We don\'t know what will follow in his presidency, and it\'s quite possible that some future event--a war, a scandal--will define his presidency. But we do know that he has put his imprint on the structure of American government in a way that no Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson has. \n \n The last two generations have no model for such a president. The only two other Democratic presidents of the last four decades are Jimmy Carter, a failure, and Bill Clinton, who enjoyed modest successes but failed in his most significant legislative fight. Obama, who helped pull the country out of a depression and reshaped the health care system, has already accomplished far more than Clinton. (This isn\'t necessarily Clinton\'s fault--he lacked the votes to break a Republican filibuster that Obama has--but the historical convention is to judge a president by what he and the Congress achieve together.) He will never be plausibly compared with Jimmy Carter. \n \n Historians will see this health care bill as a masterfully crafted piece of legislation. Obama and the Democrats managed to bring together most of the stakeholders and every single Senator in their party. The new law untangles the dysfunctionalities of the individual insurance market while fulfilling the political imperative of leaving the employer-provided system in place. Through determined advocacy, and against special interest opposition, they put into place numerous reforms to force efficiency into a wasteful system. They found hundreds of billions of dollars in payment offsets, a monumental task in itself. And they will bring economic and physical security to tens of millions of Americans who would otherwise risk seeing their lives torn apart. Health care experts for decades have bemoaned the impossibility of such reforms--the system is wasteful, but the very waste creates a powerful constituency for the status quo. Finally, the Democrats have begun to untangle the Gordian knot. It\'s a staggering political task and substantive achievement. \n \n The template of a powerful, historically consequential Democratic president is unfamiliar to many of us. Certainly the Republicans have no real idea how to deal with it. Look at Bill Kristol\'s taunting editorial in the Weekly Standard: \n \n After his 1851 coup d’état, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of the real Napoleon, pronounced himself Napoleon III. It was the rise to power of this great-man-wannabe that prompted the famous opening of Karl Marx’s Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis-Bonaparte: “Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.” \n \n And presiding over this three-ring circus of liberal incompetence was President Barack Obama, who stands in relation to the towering and tragic figure of Lyndon Johnson as Napoleon III did to the real Napoleon. Have we had in modern times a president who was so out of his depth? \n \n It occurs to me that Bill Kristol stands in relation to the towering and tragic figure of Irving Kristol as Napoleon III did to the real Napoleon. But I digress. The broader point is that the Republicans have spent a year chortling over the inevitable collapse of Obama, and they seem to cling even more tightly to that fantasy--""Incompetence""? ""Out of his depth""?--as it slips further away. \n \n Obama\'s accomplishments do not, and probably will not, meet those of Johnson, let alone Franklin Roosevelt. It\'s worth noting that he has smaller majorities, and governs in an era when the republican Party is far more ideologically radical and unified in opposition. A measure of that greater discipline and partisan unity can be seen in the fact that Social Security and Medicare both won significant Republican support, and both were far more liberal and government-centric in their design. \n \n We can\'t know what the future holds in store for Obama. It\'s entirely possible that Republicans will gain control of the House in November and block any further domestic progress, unemployment will stay high, and Republicans will win the White House in 2012. Yet he\'s already left his imprint on history. \n \n RELATED \n \n John B. Judis on the real lesson of the health care victory. \n \n Michelle Cottle describes the Republican implosion.']",3,"– Barack Obama earned a historic victory when the House passed health care reform last night. How did he do it and what does it mean? Here’s what people are saying: “Obama didn't just work harder to clear this hurdle. He worked deeper,” writes John Dickerson of Slate. For the first time he made a cause personal, framing it in moral terms, and urging lawmakers to risk sacrificing their jobs to do the right thing. He showed a newfound “combative stubbornness,” writes Peter Nicholas of the LA Times. Republicans thought this would be his “Waterloo,” but Obama proved “that a president who picks a goal, adopts a battle plan and sticks with it” is tough to beat. The president basically schmoozed his way to victory, says Jennifer Bendery on Roll Call. Through one-on-one talks and social events, he flipped even tough votes like Dennis Kucinich. Republicans have delighted in calling Obama ineffective or incompetent, but that’s all over, writes Jonathan Chait of The New Republic; Obama has sealed his place in history. “He will never be plausibly compared with Jimmy Carter.”"
"[""Caffeine is America's favorite drug, bar none. And while we've extolled the culinary and social aspects of coffee over the years, sometimes people don't have time for a leisurely cup of joe and just want a quick fix. \n \n Today Ben Yu, 21, one of Peter Thiel's 20 Under 20 fellows, and his partner Deven Soni, have introduced a patent-pending form of caffeine that you spray directly on your skin. (This is not to be confused with Aeroshots, another novelty energy booster that is a powder you spray in your mouth.) The marketing materials claim that caffeine diffuses through your system more gradually through the skin than through drinking. Plus, at $15 for 40 doses, it's wayyy cheaper than Red Bull. \n \n Yesterday morning, I tried it. \n \n 6:15 am: It's my morning to get up with my toddler daughter. She is super psyched to be alive as usual. I am moving a little more slowly. \n \n 9:20 am: I miss my morning coffee. Cold brew from Brooklyn roasters Oslo with milk and two packets of raw sugar. Instead I take the four-inch-long atomizer and deliver 4 sprays to the inside of my left wrist. The foamy liquid delivers no residue on the skin. I sniff—no aroma whatsoever, let alone a rich, roasty one. Sigh. \n \n 9:27 am: My eyes pop open like Betty Boop's. \n \n 9:43 am: Whoo-hoo! The rush is a little bit disconcerting. Despite the claims, it feels like I drank my coffee very, very quickly. The tiny bottle contains 40 doses, 160 sprays. It's recommended not to take more than 20 sprays in a day, but it would be pretty easy to overdose with such a small bottle, or if you just lose count. \n \n 10:06 am: I offer my office mate at the co-working space a couple of sprays, but he says no way. \n \n 11:04 am: I'm writing my third blog post of the day, feeling no more jittery or distracted than usual. \n \n 2:15 pm: I'm hitting the post-lunchtime slump. The little caffeine canister is sitting right there on the corner of my desk, and the free cans of Coke Zero are all the way downstairs. I take a little squirt to the back of the neck. \n \n 2:17 pm: Whoo!! Heart is beating fast. \n \n 4:49 pm: Well, I got through my day. \n \n I can't say that I'll be converting to Sprayable Energy any time soon. It turns out I like the ritual, and the flavor and aroma, of coffee. And without these atmospherics, I feel too much like a caffeine addict jonesing for a fix. It's also worth remembering that there are growing health and legal concerns arising from products with huge amounts of caffeine. \n \n On the other hand, the $40 billion energy products market might have room for a solution that delivers this kind of jolt this quickly, with an extra spray of novelty to boot. \n \n [Image courtesy of Sprayable Energy]"", 'The people want Sprayable Energy. \n \n Why? Part of the stated appeal is simplicity. No scary chemicals. The product is a just three ingredients: caffeine, water, and a compound that helps it be absorbed by our skin (a derivative of the naturally-occurring amino acid tyrosine). Though Yu and Soni have also sort of obfuscated their premise by calling it a ""secret sauce."" \n \n (Sprayable Energy) \n \n Yu and Soni say their recommended dose—four sprays—should deliver about the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee. \n \n Their Sprayable Energy website also clearly states: ""The product is odorless, colorless, and safe."" The Indiego pitch says, in bold font, ""Never be concerned for your health when using caffeinated products again."" \n \n Who better than the proprietor of a new transdermal stimulant product to tell us that it\'s safe? We don\'t have reason to expect it to be any less safe than other caffeine delivery methods, though it\'s not been tested by the FDA. This sort of product is exempt. In May the FDA announced that it planned to look into our large-scale deployment of caffeine, retroactively. It said at the time, ""In response to a trend in which caffeine is being added to a growing number of products [jelly beans, waffles, gum, syrup], the agency will investigate the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents."" \n \n Image from the Sprayable Energy campaign. If this is relatable, consider an EKG. And start reusing your cups. \n \n So the organization in charge of making sure that everything we consume topically and otherwise is safe for us is, decades into the mass marketing and sale of caffeinated products without regulation, planning to look into their safety. As I wrote at the time, the only time the FDA explicitly approved adding caffeine was beverages (colas) in the 1950s (not long after increased caffeine had replaced the psychoactive component of coca leaves in soda—the latter, essentially cocaine, having been implicated in a spate of rapes). The current FDA stance is that beverages should not contain more than .02 percent caffeine. \n \n The FDA\'s mid-century caffeine approval almost certainly did not anticipate fortified waffles and skin sprays. Michael Taylor, a deputy commissioner at FDA, said in May, ""We believe that some in the food industry are on a dubious, potentially dangerous path. If necessary, and the science indicates that it is warranted, we are prepared to go through the regulatory process to establish clear boundaries and conditions on caffeine use. We are also prepared to consider enforcement action against individual products as appropriate."" \n \n An upside to Sprayable Energy—though I wouldn\'t go as far as Yu and Soni do in their pitch (""Caffeine products currently suck"")—is that coffee can cause stomach ulcers and yellow teeth. And energy drinks can come with a load of extra sugar. Both can add up cost-wise if you\'re using regularly. (These are the aforementioned issues.) For some, a cutaneous route of delivery may turn out to be a relatively healthy way to get caffeine.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The two are trying to launch a product called ""Sprayable Energy,"" that, you guessed it, gives you a jolt of caffeine straight through your skin. While skin is capable of absorbing caffeine, caffeine normally isn't soluble enough to actually be effective. Sprayable Energy adds a ""secret sauce"" (a derivative of the amino acid tyrosine) to correct for that, the Atlantic reports. The spray is comprised of just three ingredients: that derivative, plus caffeine and water.

Just seeing or being told about the signature at the end of the diary would have been enough for him to reach for the phone. \n \n “He was not very literate and the idea that he would have been capable of producing such a sophisticated and credible forgery is not remotely plausible.” \n \n MOST READ IN LIVING GREAT BRITISH BUZZ OFF We rate sex toys from Poundland Bullet to Tango Lipstick to see if discount brands are an anti-climax fresh princess Remember Ashley from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air?

Was he Jack the Ripper? He now has to be a prime suspect, but the disputes over the Ripper\'s identity may well rage for another century at least"". \n \n A limited edition of 25 Years of The Diary of Jack The Ripper: The True Facts by Robert Smith is available from www.mangobooks.co.uk from September 4.', 'I spend probably 40 minutes a day crammed cheek to sweaty jowl with other London commuters—some of them drunks, farters, and shovers—in a swiftly moving cylinder hundreds of feet underground. It’s usually hot, and despite the fact that we are Tetrised in there, all of us are trying desperately to pretend that we are completely alone. Rarely do I give thanks for the experience, but this year marks the 155th anniversary of the London Underground, that efficient marvel of public transport. \n \n On January 9, 1863, the world’s first-ever underground railway train, steam-operated, pulled out of Paddington Station, and rumbled 3.5 miles down the tubular tunnel to Farringdon Station. The line, which was financed by Metropolitan Railway, was an instant success: Approximately 40,000 people lined up for the novelty of riding a train underground. Within six months, 26,000 people were riding the train each day. \n \n By 1884, there were more than 800 trains in operation in what was called the Inner Circle, a circular line that enclosed central London and that is now just the Circle Line. And now, with more than five times that number of trains operating and millions of people safely and swiftly reaching their destinations every day, the London Underground is truly a modern miracle of efficient transport. Here are 18 impressive facts and figures you might not have known about the London Tube. \n \n 1. THE MAJORITY OF THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS NOT UNDERGROUND. \n \n \n \n iStock \n \n The entire London Underground network is approximately 249 miles long, employing more than 4100 trains, and linking 270 stations. But only about 45 percent of those miles are underground. \n \n 2. EACH TRAIN TRAVELS ABOUT 114,500 MILES A YEAR. \n \n Each Tube train travels an average of 114,500 miles a year, or 4.6 times around the world. The longest distance between adjacent stations is approximately 3.9 miles, between Chesham to Chalfont & Latimer. The shortest distance is about 984 feet, between Leicester Square and Covent Garden on the Picadilly Line (and since Covent Garden is usually mobbed, you’re better off getting off at Leicester Square and walking). \n \n 3. MORE THAN 1 BILLION JOURNEYS ARE MADE EACH YEAR. \n \n Each year, about 1.3 billion journeys are made on the London Underground. The busiest station in the network is Waterloo, which sees about 100.3 million passengers per year; the least used is Roding Valley. \n \n 4. HALF A MILLION MICE CALL THE UNDERGROUND HOME. \n \n An estimated 500,000 mice live in the tunnels, but they’re not the only pests—the mosquitoes that live in the Tube are of a different and somewhat more vicious species than their aboveground cousins. Called Culex pipiens molestus, they’re supposedly known for their voracious appetites. \n \n 5. THERE AE SOME GHOSTS REPORTEDLY LIVING DOWN THERE, TOO. \n \n The London Underground is also supposedly home to a group of subterranean Londoners, who, just like the Mole People of New York’s Subway, took to the tunnels and mutated. The Tube is also reportedly home to a host of ghostly apparitions, including the Faceless Woman of Beacontree Station, the Toothy Man of Channelsea Depot, and the Screaming Spectre of Farringdon Station. \n \n 6. THE AVERAGE LONDONER SPENDS 11.5 DAYS OF EACH YEAR ON THE TUBE. \n \n The average Londoner spends an average of about 11.5 days each year on the Underground—5.2 of those days in the Underground’s underground tunnels. (What’s unknown is how many hours of those days are spent stopped underground, waiting for a signal failure to be resolved, another train to move along, or for whatever bit of rubbish that has been thrown on the tracks at the station ahead of you to be cleared.) \n \n 7. THE FASTEST TRAINS TRAVEL AT SPEEDS OF OVER 60 MILES PER HOUR. \n \n The fastest line is the Metropolitan, where trains can reach speeds of more than 60 miles per hour, but the average speed of a London Underground train is only around 20.5 miles per hour. \n \n 8. THE DEEPEST STATION IS NEARLY 200 FEET BELOW STREET LEVEL. \n \n The deepest Underground station is Hampstead, on the Northern Line, which is located nearly 192 feet below street level. There’s an elevator, of course, but also an emergency spiral staircase featuring more than 320 steps, in case of emergency (or a fit of exercise mania). \n \n 9. IN 1969, QUEEN ELIZABETH TOOK CONTROL OF THE VICTORIA LINE. \n \n In 1969, Queen Elizabeth II commemorated the opening of the Victoria Line by driving one of the new trains from Green Park to Oxford Circus. It was her second ride ever on a London Underground train, the first being when she was 13 and accompanied by her sister and governess. Presumably her stint as Tube driver was without incident as eight years later, the Queen was again allowed in the cab of a Picadilly Line train when she presided over the opening of the line’s extension. \n \n 10. THE FIRST ESCALATOR WAS A MISERABLE FAILURE. \n \n The Underground’s first real escalator was built in 1911 at Earl’s Court, but four years before that, a spiral escalator was installed at Holloway Road Station. It didn’t last very long—in fact, it only lasted a day of testing and never actually saw public use. Its remains are held at the London Transport Museum’s Depot, which is only open to the public a few times per year. \n \n 11. THE LONGEST ESCALATOR IS NEARLY 200 FEET LONG. \n \n The longest escalator at any Underground station is the 197-foot-long moving stair at Angel, in Islington, on the Northern line. \n \n 12. PEOPLE HAVE LEFT A LOT OF WEIRD THINGS ON THE TRAINS. \n \n Among the strangest things left on the Underground and collected by the Lost Property Office: A jar of bull semen; outboard motor; three dead bats in a container; a vasectomy kit; a harpoon gun, which may have gone with the 14-foot long boat; a stuffed eagle; breast implants; false teeth and a surprising number of prosthetic limbs; a four-foot tall Mickey Mouse; six full-sized mannequins; and an urn containing a dead man’s ashes, which was reunited with his brother five years after it was lost. \n \n 13. JERRY SPRINGER WAS BORN AT HIGHGATE STATION. \n \n Politician-turned-trash talk show host Jerry Springer was born at Highgate Station on the Northern Line on February 13, 1944, when his mother sought shelter during a Luftwaffe raid during World War II. \n \n 14. MANY PEOPLE USED TUBE STATIONS ARE AIR RAID SHELTERS DURING WORLD WAR II, EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT BANNED THE PRACTICE. \n \n Speaking of air raids: At the start of the London Blitz, Germany’s nightly bombing raids on the British capital in September 1939, the government banned people from using the Tube stations as air raid shelters, claiming that the stations should be reserved only for transport. People got around the ban by simply buying a ticket and refusing to the leave the platform. A month later, the government realized that the ban was unenforceable at best and cruel at worst, and gave the go-ahead for stations to be used as shelters. \n \n By the end of the war, sheltering in the Underground had became so regular that a ticketing scheme was introduced to keep people from panicking at the queues, and more than 22,000 bunk beds were installed in stations across the system to provide places for them to sleep. \n \n 15. ITS ICONIC MAP WAS INSPIRED BY A CIRCUIT BOARD. \n \n \n \n iStock \n \n The London Underground’s iconic map, which bears no relationship to actual topographical or geographical features, was designed in 1933 by Harry Beck. Beck, an engineering draftsman who worked in the London Underground’s signals office, was supposedly inspired by electronic circuit boards, and saw ways of tidying up the lines. But the department rejected the initial proposal, claiming it was too radical, and Beck was paid a paltry less than $15 for his work. Two years and some modifications later, however, the Underground adopted the map and has used it ever since.']",2,"– In 1992, a 9,000-word diary was found in the floorboards of a home in England containing a detailed confession to murders tied to Jack the Ripper, the serial killer who terrorized London for 10 weeks in 1888. It ended thusly: ""I give my name that all know of me, so history do tell, what love can do to a gentleman born. Yours Truly, Jack The Ripper."" It appears to belong to wealthy Liverpool cotton Merchant James Maybrick, who died a year later, but many experts dismissed the tell-all tome as a sophisticated forgery. Now, the Telegraph reports, a team led by writer and film director Bruce Robinson has unearthed timecards that show which electricians were working on Maybrick's home, Battlecrease House, on March 9, 1992, the morning the book was said to have been found. The man who came up with the diary, scrap metal dealer Mike Barrett, claimed to have gotten it through a family friend who died soon thereafter, leading many to believe it was a fake. But Barrett was a colorful character who frequented the Saddle Inn public house in Anfield, where one of the electricians working on Battlecrease House was also a regular. Because Barrett fancied himself a writer, it is believed that the electricians who found the book passed it onto Barrett, who then famously contacted a London literary agent that very day in March claiming he had Jack the Ripper's diary, adds the Sun. Mental Floss notes that many suspects have been proposed over the decades, including a former royal obstetrician. (The Ripper's last known victim remains mysterious.)"
"[""THE SHOCKING and tragic death of the President of Poland, his wife and a large official delegation in an air crash has prompted press speculation as to why Poland still used an ageing Soviet aircraft to carry national leaders, a Tupolev Tu-154. \n \n \n \n As a question, it pales beside the enormity of the loss that Poland has suffered--made all the more painful because the delegation of Polish leaders were on their way to commemorate another of the country's greatest moments of loss, the Katyn massacre of 20,000 Polish reservist officers by Soviet secret police in 1940. \n \n \n \n But if it helps clear up such speculation, your correspondent has part of an answer, after having discussed this very question with a senior Polish official, under happier circumstances. A few years ago, I was invited by the defence ministry to visit a NATO base then watch Polish troops training for a mission in Afghanistan. My small group of journalists were flown from Brussels to Poland and then around the country on one of the smaller planes in the Polish government VIP fleet, a Soviet-built Yak 40. There was no doubting the plane's age, though it appeared immaculately maintained and the Polish air force crew were exceedingly professional. \n \n \n \n Nonetheless, given the strong attachment of today's Poland to modernity and the western world, I asked one of our hosts why the VIP fleet still used aircraft from the Soviet era. The answer was pragmatism. The old planes were noisy and were not fuel efficient, but they were serviceable and tough. \n \n \n \n In the case of the Tu-154, it was dated, noisy and not that comfortable, but it had one great strength, I was told. A three-engined jet, it was significantly faster than the modern, two-engined airliners widely used by other governments for long-distance VIP transport. This difference in speed was such that when European leaders took off from New York, more or less en masse, to return from the United Nations General Assembly, it was noticeable that the Tupolev was always first across the Atlantic and back in European airspace. This speed played a role in keeping the plane in Polish government service. \n \n \n \n This detail hardly matters now at a time of such national sorrow, but if it helps explain why a large, modern and technologically-advanced country like Poland was flying such an old plane, perhaps that is of some small assistance."", ""Investigators seeking the cause of a plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife and a delegation including dozens of high-level officials on Saturday are likely to focus on both the Tupolev 154 jetliner and the pilots' actions. \n \n The Russian-made plane, which was 20 years old, had been overhauled in December at a Russian aviation facility and had flown relatively few hours. \n \n The TU-154, which crashed outside Smolensk, Russia, was on its second attempt to land amid heavy fog, Russian officials said. Investigators will seek to understand why the crew tried bring the plane down in such unfavorable ...""]",2,"– As Poland wrestles with the death of President Lech Kaczysnki and 96 others in today's plane crash, attention is turning to the pilots' actions and the Soviet-era plane involved: The pilots ignored orders not to try to land because of heavy fog, reports AP. The plane involved is a 20-year-old Soviet-era Tupelo 154 that had been overhauled in December. Wall Street Journal blogger Marcin Sobczyk notes the planes were nicknamed ""flying coffins"" in Poland. So why are Polish leaders using such old planes? An Economist blogger who flew in one notes that the Tu-154 ""was dated, noisy and not that comfortable, but it had one great strength, I was told. A three-engined jet, it was significantly faster than the modern, two-engined airliners widely used by other governments for long-distance VIP transport. ...

He also said that he didn't kiss the woman and that they were walking to the dance floor when McDowell attacked them. \n \n McDowell is currently facing misdemeanor battery charges. \n \n In a statement to CBS12, McDowell explained her side of the story, which read in part: \n \n Now I’ll tell my truth. I was told, by Darby Johns, that he would be attending a friend’s wedding and would be going alone. The day of the wedding, I was told by a shocked/dumbfounded friend, who knew that Darby and I were together, that she had seen Darby and Crystal Munoz getting too close to be “just friends.” After hearing this, I decided I needed to see the situation and the actions that were occurring for myself. So, I showed up to the wedding. In the beginning, I wore a black wig, so that nobody would recognize me. I just wanted to find out what was going on, unnoticed, and leave. My intention was to SEE what was happening, and if I saw him betraying me, it would have been a way for me to know and understand that our relationship was over. \n \n To me, lying to and cheating on someone you love is the utmost betrayal. Like I stated earlier, I was going to sit down, see if what I heard was true, and then LEAVE. I sat down at a table alone and spotted them. It was quite effortless to spot him, since Crystal was sitting on his lap. I watched them with their arms around each other, laughing, drinking, and even kissing. When they got up and held hands to walk to the dance floor is when my emotions took over. I picked up a drink, walked to where they were, and poured the drink, intended for Darby, on them. He was the one that had deceived me. However, Crystal thought the drink being poured was meant for her. I never aimed anything towards her. \n \n After this incident, I walked to the bathroom, where I bawled my eyes out because of what I had just witnessed. While sitting in a bathroom stall crying, I was interrupted by 4 girls yelling and banging on my stall door. I ignored them at first, because I was so disturbed, but one of the girls crawled under my stall door and demanded to know who I was and why I was there. I opened the stall door, tried to get around the girl on the ground, and I said, “I am here because Darby and Crystal were together, and Darby and I are in a relationship.” They continued to shout at me and I tried to leave, but I was punched in the face, drug to the ground, and even strangled. Might I add, I was in a car accident just a little over a year ago, where I received an emergency spinal fusion. I have 2 rods and 7 screws in my back, so imagine being tackled to the ground and the stress my spine received. The girls were eventually pulled off me. I stayed in the bathroom to clean up, and then I was going to leave. \n \n I am aware that going to a wedding uninvited is wrong. I am aware that pouring a drink on someone is also wrong. I just wanted to see if Darby was really cheating, so that I could know it was forever over between us. It was always about him, never Crystal. I never intended for there to be a scene. After the drink incident, if the girls had not of attacked me, there would never have been such a chaotic scene. I am very apologetic towards the bride and groom, since this happened at their wedding. Like I said, I never intended for it to have gotten so out of control.""]",3,"– Bridesmaids who party together, fight together. That was apparently the unspoken code at a wedding last Sunday in Palm Coast, Fla., where the New York Post reports an uninvited interloper caused a scene with a man she claimed was her boyfriend. Per WKMG, deputies say 20-year-old Shelby McDowell snuck into the Hammock Beach Resort to keep tabs on Darby Johns, who was attending a wedding there as an invited guest and who McDowell says is her romantic partner. Once there, McDowell said she saw Johns making out with a woman on the dance floor. That woman told cops McDowell rushed over to where she and Johns were, tossed a drink on the pair, then punched her face; Johns says they hadn't even made it to the dance floor yet when McDowell came onto the scene, and he denies kissing the other woman. After allegedly assaulting Johns' companion, witnesses say McDowell then ran to a resort bathroom—and that's when the wedding party apparently decided to get involved. McDowell says a bunch of bridesmaids yanked her out of a bathroom stall by her feet and started hitting her, but the resort manager told police that when he arrived on the scene to break up the brawl, McDowell was on top of the woman who'd been with Johns and was punching her. To make matters more complicated, at least for McDowell: Johns says she's not his girlfriend. McDowell was booked at the Flagler County Jail and faces misdemeanor battery charges, per WPEC.

"['AFP/Getty Images NBA Finals MVP LeBron James of the Miami Heat holds the championship trophy after defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. \n \n MIAMI—When speaking about his oft-criticized and overanalyzed star, LeBron James, Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has a line: You can\'t win unless you win. \n \n LeBron James won in every conceivable way Thursday as his Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder, 121-106, in Game 5 of the NBA Finals to win James\'s first NBA title. Jared Diamond has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Getty Images. \n \n James won in every conceivable way Thursday as his Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder, 121-106, in Game 5 of the NBA Finals to win James\'s first NBA title, erasing nine years of doubts and disappointment. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Getty Images LeBron James celebrated late in the fourth quarter. \n \n The man dubbed ""The King"" in high school finally had his coronation, and while the game will go down in history as James\'s vindication party, it will not be remembered as particularly dramatic. The Heat led by 24 points after three quarters and were never threatened. Despite the fact that this was a mere formality—the Heat had a commanding 3-1 lead in the series and frankly, the Heat were expected to win the title due to their talent—the mood among the team, especially James, was giddiness and joy. Drenched in champagne, he could not stop smiling. In the packed, alcohol-soaked locker room, he became separated from his Finals MVP trophy and immediately started hollering that he needed to hold it again. It is apparently good to be King. \n \n For the Heat, this is the reward for an impossibly wacky two years that began in the summer of 2010, when it became possibly the most disliked team in sports after James ditched the Cleveland Cavaliers to team up with Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade to form a megateam in South Florida. In a twist, Thursday\'s win didn\'t look like the superstar circus the team usually looks like: Sharpshooter Mike Miller, a role player with a bad back, made seven 3-pointers to score 23. Bosh had 24, and Wade added 20. \n \n Podcast \n \n The players, wearing white championship T-shirts, spoke of the evolution of an often-clumsy team that struggled to mesh and sometimes played out like a bad novel. After one game last year, Spoelstra revealed players were crying; in another, Spoelstra and James had what looked to be an angry collision. Miller, in fact, characterized the team by saying ""Everyone\'s dealing with something"" as if it were a soap opera, and oftentimes it was. Wade said the process of becoming a workable if colossal entity was finished this season when he took what could be considered a secondary role. \n \n ""I know I\'m playing with the best player in the world and that doesn\'t take anything away from me at all,"" Wade said. ""It was hard for me to do it, and no one would understand, but it was easy for me to do it for this team."" \n \n That didn\'t come easily last year when the Heat made the Finals but lost to the Dallas Mavericks in one of the biggest flops in recent NBA history. Wade said he saw the team\'s stars ""not wanting to step on each other"" while James saw what he had to improve on—namely, everything. \n \n ""[Losing last year] was the best thing that ever happened to me in my career,"" James said. ""Because basically, I got back to the basics, it humbled me, and I knew what it was going to take and I was hoping to have to change as a basketball player and change as a person to get what I wanted."" \n \n It wasn\'t all smiles—James sidestepped a question about what he\'d say to Cleveland fans tonight, two years after leaving the team during a television special called ""The Decision."" When asked another question about the shortened season, he answered simply that none of it mattered, he was an NBA champion. \n \n James notched a triple-double in a superb 44 minutes, with 26 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds to set a steady pace for a drubbing. \n \n Oklahoma City was led by Kevin Durant, who had 32 points. \n \n ""I didn\'t want to admit it during the series, but those guys are really good,"" said Durant. \n \n James, meanwhile, said the same about the team he\'d just vanquished and hinted at a sequel: ""This won\'t be the last time we see them in Finals."" \n \n Write to Kevin Clark at kevin.clark@wsj.com', ""LeBron James, Miami Heat win NBA championship, rout Oklahoma City Thunder 121-106 in Game 5 King James' gets triple-double, wins Finals MVP and leads Miami to NBA title two years after televised special 'The Decision' broke hearts of hometown \n \n HEAT 121, THUNDER 106 \n \n \n \n MIAMI — LeBron James danced the last few precious seconds away, soaking up the moment and waiting to take a confetti shower. The one-time child prodigy, with a smile you could see from Cleveland, was a kid once more. \n \n \n \n And finally a King. \n \n \n \n PHOTOS: LEBRON, HEAT WIN NBA TITLE \n \n \n \n “It’s about damn time,” James said when it was over. “It’s about damn time.” \n \n \n \n A few weeks shy of the two-year anniversary of his infamous made-for-television special, “The Decision,” James delivered on his promise to bring an NBA championship to Miami. \n \n \n \n LUPICA: LEBRON'S HEAT WILL TORMENT KNICKS LIKE JORDAN'S BULLS \n \n \n \n Only time will tell if he ever lives up to “five, six, seven” titles he once predicted, but at least James and the Miami Heat have something to build on. \n \n \n \n Title No. 1 for James was clinched on Thursday night as the Miami Heat overpowered the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder, 121-106, in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. James, who uttered the phrase, “I’m going to take my talents to South Beach” when he announced he was leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers after seven seasons to sign with Miami, punctuated his first championship by recording a triple-double. \n \n \n \n LAWRENCE: KING JAMES SILENCES CRITICS WITH RING \n \n \n \n “This right here is the happiest day of my life,” James said from the podium after embracing his mother, Gloria. “It’s a dream come true.” \n \n \n \n The world’s best all-around player also pulled off a rare double by being named NBA Finals MVP in the same year when he was MVP of the regular season. \n \n \n \n It was a fitting encore to the “LBJ Redemption Tour,” which started when he admitted that he should have handled his exit from his home state of Ohio with more class. James also publicly acknowledged that he failed miserably as the Heat lost the NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks in six games last season. \n \n \n \n “I was a selfish player,” James said. “I was a selfish person.” \n \n \n \n The hurt from that performance served as motivation for James to return this season as a better, more mature player. He was dominant during Miami’s playoff run, which began with victories over the Knicks, Pacers and Celtics. \n \n \n \n Overall, he scored 30 or more points in 13 of 23 playoff games, including two games against the Thunder. He was averaging 29 points in four Finals games, but with the Heat in control for a majority of Game 5, James didn’t need his A-game. And yet, he still ended the season with 26 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LeBron James hugs partner-in-crime Dwyane Wade after the duo help the Miami blowout the Thunder.

He was then mobbed by his teammates and coaches when he got to the bench. \n \n \n \n Chris Bosh, who left the Toronto Raptors as a free agent two summers ago to join James and Dwyane Wade, added 24 points while Wade scored 20. \n \n \n \n “This is why we came here,” Bosh said. \n \n \n \n “We came here to win a championship.” \n \n \n \n The Heat also got a huge performance from Mike Miller in what could have been his final game. The veteran shooting guard is suffering from a serious back injury and he may be forced to retire. \n \n \n \n If so, Miller, a class act, went out in grand style. He scored 23 points and made 7-of-8 three-point shots. Point guard Mario Chalmers, the hero of Game 4, added 10 points and Shane Battier had 11. \n \n \n \n It was a disappointing finish for Oklahoma City, which reached the Finals by beating three quality opponents: the Mavs, Lakers and Spurs. But after Game 1 of the Finals, the Thunder lost four straight and at times played like a young team in its first Finals. Oklahoma City had only one three-game losing streak during the regular season. \n \n \n \n \n \n LeBron James - aka 'King James' - is finally on top of the NBA.

The Thunder trailed over the final 42 minutes while Miami went up by 27 in the fourth quarter. \n \n \n \n Through it all, Heat president Pat Riley sat emotionless for much of the night in his customary seat across from the Miami bench. Riley’s decision to resign as Knicks coach following the 1994-95 season has paid off handsomely for the Heat. Miami has its second title in six years, which gives the franchise as many trophies as the Knicks, who began play in 1946-47 and last won in 1973. The Miami Heat entered the league in 1988-89. \n \n \n \n “I hope to see OKC again,” Riley said from the podium. “I think we will.” \n \n \n \n James and the Heat may just be getting started. At 27, James is in the prime of his career and after losing in two previous Finals appearances, he appears to be more comfortable in this setting. James’ teams went 2-9 in his first 11 NBA Finals games. He has now won four straight and the throne is his. \n \n \n \n It’s good to be the King.""]",2,"– LeBron James was king of the court last night as the forward finally made good on his promise to bring an NBA championship to Miami. The Heat suffocated the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-106 in Game 5. LeBron was the star, chalking up a triple-double in 44 minutes, with 26 points, 13 assists, and 11 rebounds. The Heat led by 24 points after three quarters, and never looked back, notes the Wall Street Journal. ""It’s about damn time,"" James said during the trophy presentation, calling it ""the happiest day in my life"" and ""a dream come true."" James averaged 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists in the series, and was named the most valuable player by a unanimous vote. Chris Bosh, who left the Toronto Raptors as a free agent two summers ago to join LeBron and Dwyane Wade, added 24 points to last night's game while Wade scored 20. Mike Miller, suffering from a serious back injury that could end his career, scored 23 points and nailed 7 of 8 three-pointers, reports the New York Daily News. James' disappointing history as the antihero of the ESPN special The Decision, when he made his painful announcement he was leaving Ohio for Miami, his flawed role in last year's finals, and his inability to deliver a championship to his Cleveland hometown was blown away in Game 5. Now, ""the greatest NBA player"" without a championship ring ""will soon have one,"" notes the New York Times."
"['The Internal Revenue Service is demanding a whopping $7 billion or more in back taxes from the world’s most profitable hedge fund, whose boss’s wealth and cyber savvy helped Donald Trump pole-vault into the White House. \n \n Suddenly, the government’s seven-year pursuit of Renaissance Technologies LLC is blanketed in political intrigue, now that the hedge fund’s reclusive, anti-establishment co-chief executive, Robert Mercer, has morphed into a political force who might be owed a big presidential favor. \n \n With Trump in the Oval Office, Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, who has become his public voice, seem armed with political firepower every which way you look – and that’s even though presidential adviser Stephen Bannon, their former senior executive and political strategist, appears to have recently lost influence. \n \n Since the IRS found in 2010 that a complicated banking method used by Renaissance and about 10 other hedge funds was a tax-avoidance scheme, Mercer has gotten increasingly active in politics. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, he doled out more than $22 million to outside conservative groups seeking to influence last year’s elections, while advocating the abolition of the IRS and much of the federal government. \n \n The Mercer Family Foundation, run by Rebekah Mercer, also has donated millions of dollars to conservative nonprofit groups that have called for the firing of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, an Obama administration holdover whose five-year term expires in November. \n \n One of them, the Heritage Foundation, received $1.5 million from the Mercer foundation from 2013 through 2015, according to its most recent public tax filings. \n \n Bob has always been very good at leveraging his money. . . . Bob’s been very dissatisfied with U.S. politics for many years. . . . I remember him being very outspoken about Hillary Clinton. Renaissance co-founder Nick Patterson, who recruited Mercer to the hedge fund in 1993 \n \n IRS leader Koskinen has said publicly that he intends to finish his term. On his watch, the agency hasn’t been cowed by the Mercers. \n \n The IRS recently released a little-noticed advisory stating that its top targets in future business audits will include so-called “basket options,” the instruments that Renaissance and some other hedge funds have used to convert short-term capital gains to long-term profits that have lower tax rates. \n \n But Renaissance, with assets estimated at $97 billion on Dec. 31, 2016, has shown no signs of buckling to the IRS’s demands. \n \n Nor has there been a hint as to whether Trump, a real estate developer who has refused to make his tax returns public, will intercede. The White House declined to respond to questions about the matter. \n \n Richard Painter, chief White House ethics adviser under President George W. Bush, said the optics surrounding the Mercers’ political connections and the IRS case “are terrible.” \n \n “The guy’s got a big case in front of the IRS,” said Painter, now a University of Minnesota law professor who is also vice chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “He’s trying to put someone in there who’s going to drop the case. Is the president of the United States going to succumb to that or is he not?” \n \n “Are we going to have a commissioner of the IRS who aggressively enforces the law and takes good cases to Tax Court or (somebody who) just throws away tax cases so billionaires don’t have to pay their taxes and the rest of us can pay more taxes?” \n \n The case against Renaissance was initiated before Koskinen became commissioner. \n \n It’s illegal for the IRS to discuss ongoing tax cases, and the agency declines to comment about Renaissance. But in 2014, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a blistering report detailing Renaissance’s use of so-called “basket options” trades by its employees-only Medallion Fund to slash taxes on $34 billion in profits. The panel estimated that Renaissance’s back tax bill dating to the earliest IRS audit would be at least $6.8 billion. \n \n Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for the Mercers, declined to comment on the case. \n \n He pointed McClatchy to a Renaissance statement issued in 2014 in response to the Senate findings. Renaissance said then that its tax calculations were “appropriate under current law” and that it had “cooperated fully” with the IRS inquiry. \n \n Robert Martin, a lawyer in the IRS’s chief counsel’s office who co-authored the agency’s legal notices on the issue in 2010 and 2014, said the law covering reporting of the options profits had held up for more than 75 years. \n \n Trump has the legal authority to replace Koskinen and the IRS’s chief counsel, the other agency position requiring Senate confirmation. The latter post is occupied by an acting chief counsel. \n \n John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University who monitors the behavior of Wall Street firms, said the Mercers might win Koskinen’s ouster, but he doubts they could undermine the case. \n \n “I don’t know they’re going to get their candidate in,” he said, “and I’m not sure many candidates are going to try to reverse the staff on something that’s already deeply advanced in either litigation or negotiation.” \n \n Dennis Ventry, an expert in tax law policy from the University of California at Davis School of Law, said he was unaware of any instance in which a president had intervened to stop a tax audit or prosecution. So far, he said, Trump “has been remarkably restrained regarding the IRS.” \n \n The guy’s got a big case in front of the IRS. He’s trying to put someone in there who’s going to drop the case. Is the president of the United States going to succumb to that or is he not? Richard Painter, chief White House ethics adviser under President George W. Bush \n \n A former IBM computer scientist, Mercer has forged a web of relationships reaching high into the new administration. \n \n At the top is Bannon, a former senior executive of Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm in which Mercer owns the largest stake. The firm, a U.S. subsidiary of a British company, is credited with playing a key role in Trump’s victory by providing his campaign with electronic dossiers shedding light on the views of 220 million Americans. \n \n Mercer funded Bannon to produce hard-edged political films and a book attacking Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent in the presidential race. Mercer also invested millions of dollars to become majority owner of far-right Breitbart News with Bannon at the helm. The Mercers and Bannon helped to fuel conservatives’ anger over the IRS’s 2013 investigations challenging the tax-exempt status of right-leaning nonprofit groups, and Mercer funded a number of efforts calling for Koskinen’s impeachment. \n \n On March 29, at least 30 conservative leaders, including a Heritage Foundation representative, converged on the White House for an off-the-record meeting with Trump aides. The groups pressed a range of agendas, especially urging Koskinen’s firing, said one attendee, President Tom Fitton of the nonprofit group Judicial Watch. \n \n In a phone interview, Fitton said “the conservative movement is united in its belief there need to be changes at the IRS,” but he voiced frustration “that the Trump administration seems to be of two minds on whether or not to replace” Koskinen before his term expires. \n \n Fitton declined to identify other attendees, and the Trump White House has abandoned a longtime practice of publicly releasing visitor logs. \n \n The meeting was organized by White House aide Paul Teller, who worked with Rebekah Mercer on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s failed Republican presidential campaign – an effort that Robert Mercer backed with $13.5 million in donations to an independent, pro-Cruz super PAC freed of the usual contribution limits. Mercer gave millions of dollars more to the committee after Cruz bowed out and the super PAC threw its financial allegiance to Trump. \n \n Other groups that have joined the anti-IRS and anti-Koskinen choruses also got money from the Mercer foundation – $600,000 to the Cato Institute in 2014 and 2015 and $250,000 to Citizens for Self-Governance in 2014. \n \n Perhaps the biggest Mercer foundation beneficiary has been the Citizens United Foundation, which received $3.8 million from 2011 through 2015. The foundation’s advocacy arm, Citizens United, wants Koskinen to be impeached. It also spearheaded attacks on Clinton last year over her use of a personal email account to conduct official business during eight years as secretary of state. David Bossie, who is president of both Citizens United entities, and Rebekah Mercer collaborated on the super PAC that backed Trump and later as members of Trump’s transition team. \n \n “Bob (Mercer) has always been very good at leveraging his money” in both business and politics, said Nick Patterson, a Renaissance co-founder and former intelligence code-breaker who recruited Mercer to the hedge fund in 1993. “Bob’s been very dissatisfied with U.S. politics for many years.” \n \n Spokespeople for the Heritage Foundation, Cato, Citizens for Self-Governance and Citizens United did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Robert Mercer became co-CEO at Renaissance, or RenTech, in November 2009 as the federal government was cracking down on abuses that had contributed to the nation’s worst financial crisis since the Depression. \n \n As a high-volume, high-frequency trader, RenTech’s role in the crisis attracted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the IRS. Federal agents were alarmed by what they found. \n \n In 2010, the IRS issued a public memorandum warning hedge funds and banks about using “basket options,” structures in which banks loaned funds for the traders to purchase derivatives, which they held in “baskets.” It didn’t mention RenTech by name. \n \n The IRS memo said that hedge funds – not their partner banks – controlled the underlying assets and thus should pay taxes at a higher capital gains rate. \n \n Some hedge funds and banks stopped using basket options, but RenTech persisted. \n \n Then, in July 2014, Democratic Chairman Carl Levin of the Senate Investigations Subcommittee and its ranking Republican, Arizona Sen. John McCain, issued the report accusing Renaissance of a giant tax dodge on hundreds of millions of options trades dating to 1999. \n \n The panel said basket-trading also had enabled RenTech to dramatically increase its leverage, meaning it could borrow up to 10 times more money against its securities portfolio. \n \n Following the Senate investigation, the IRS issued a notice in 2015 that left no doubt basket-option contracts were taxable as ordinary income. \n \n Without identifying the affected party, IRS attorney Martin confirmed in a phone interview that one ongoing IRS enforcement case stems from basket trades. He said such options cases came down to ensuring that financial instruments were defined for what they really were. \n \n “If you are going to call it a derivative . . . it has to function like a derivative,” he said. “And if it functions like a brokerage account, that’s how it has to be treated.” \n \n The Renaissance case is not yet in tax court. \n \n In the years since the case began, the father-daughter Mercer team has set an agenda that amounts to a full-fledged assault on the established order. \n \n Besides the IRS, targets have included former President Barack Obama, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Department of Justice, various Democratic and moderate Republican members of Congress, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and burdensome regulations and agencies that hinder Mercer’s energy investments. \n \n Mercer has called the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a mistake and has voiced disdain for other federal measures to protect the rights of African-Americans and other minorities. \n \n The Mercers’ foundation gave nearly $11 million from 2011 to 2014 to the Media Research Center, an advocacy group whose “sole mission,” according to its website, “is to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media.” \n \n In a rare public statement weeks before Trump’s upset victory, the Mercers said they believe that “America is finally fed up and disgusted with its political elite.” \n \n “Trump is channeling this disgust,” they said, “and those among the political elite who quake before the boom-box of media blather do not appreciate the apocalyptic choice that America faces.” \n \n In 2010, the same year the IRS issued its memo, the Supreme Court handed down a landmark ruling lifting restraints on how much money wealthy donors such as the Mercers may spend to influence election outcomes. \n \n RenTech soon tripled its lobbying expenditures. Last year, it paid $300,000 to a Washington lobbyist and tax strategist, James Miller, a former high-ranking attorney in the IRS’s office of chief counsel. Miller’s public disclosures say his lobbying topics included taxes on derivatives. \n \n And by 2014 the Mercer Family Foundation had distributed $70 million in donations, mainly to conservative nonprofit groups. \n \n By 2016, Renaissance’s founder and chairman, Jim Simons, was one of the Democratic Party’s top backers, and Mercer was a leading Republican donor, making RenTech a leading player in national politics. \n \n Some of Mercer’s projects sought to unseat his Republican adversaries, such as McCain, who became the target of negative ad campaigns during a primary race. \n \n Meanwhile, Rebekah Mercer accumulated so much clout she has been credited with influencing Trump’s choices of several top appointees, including Bannon, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, resigned in February after revelations that he had misled the White House about post-election discussions with Russia’s ambassador. \n \n In January, Rebekah Mercer attended a private meeting in which she had “substantative communications” with Jay Clayton, Trump’s likely nominee to chair the SEC, Clayton later revealed in response to questions from the Senate Banking Committee in advance of his confirmation hearings. The SEC regulates hedge funds. \n \n The Mercers’ struggle didn’t end with Trump’s election. \n \n Bannon, the former Mercer political strategist who now speaks for the White House, seemed to capsulize it in a speech to conservative activists in February. \n \n The goal, he said, amounts to nothing less than unfettered American capitalism and the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”', 'Last month, when President Donald Trump toured a Boeing aircraft plant in North Charleston, South Carolina, he saw a familiar face in the crowd that greeted him: Patrick Caddell, a former Democratic political operative and pollster who, for forty-five years, has been prodding insurgent Presidential candidates to attack the Washington establishment. Caddell, who lives in Charleston, is perhaps best known for helping Jimmy Carter win the 1976 Presidential race. He is also remembered for having collaborated with his friend Warren Beatty on the 1998 satire “Bulworth.” In that film, a kamikaze candidate abandons the usual talking points and excoriates both the major political parties and the media; voters love his unconventionality, and he becomes improbably popular. If the plot sounds familiar, there’s a reason: in recent years, Caddell has offered political advice to Trump. He has not worked directly for the President, but at least as far back as 2013 he has been a contractor for one of Trump’s biggest financial backers: Robert Mercer, a reclusive Long Island hedge-fund manager, who has become a major force behind the Trump Presidency. During the past decade, Mercer, who is seventy, has funded an array of political projects that helped pave the way for Trump’s rise. Among these efforts was public-opinion research, conducted by Caddell, showing that political conditions in America were increasingly ripe for an outsider candidate to take the White House. Caddell told me that Mercer “is a libertarian—he despises the Republican establishment,” and added, “He thinks that the leaders are corrupt crooks, and that they’ve ruined the country.” Trump greeted Caddell warmly in North Charleston, and after giving a speech he conferred privately with him, in an area reserved for V.I.P.s and for White House officials, including Stephen Bannon, the President’s top strategist, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Caddell is well known to this inner circle. He first met Trump in the eighties. (“People said he was just a clown,” Caddell said. “But I’ve learned that you should always pay attention to successful ‘clowns.’ ”) Caddell shared the research he did for Mercer with Trump and others in the campaign, including Bannon, with whom he has partnered on numerous projects. The White House declined to divulge what Trump and Caddell discussed in North Charleston, as did Caddell. But that afternoon Trump issued perhaps the most incendiary statement of his Presidency: a tweet calling the news media “the enemy of the American people.” The proclamation alarmed liberals and conservatives alike. William McRaven, the retired Navy admiral who commanded the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, called Trump’s statement a “threat to democracy.” The President is known for tweeting impulsively, but in this case his words weren’t spontaneous: they clearly echoed the thinking of Caddell, Bannon, and Mercer. In 2012, Caddell gave a speech at a conference sponsored by Accuracy in Media, a conservative watchdog group, in which he called the media “the enemy of the American people.” That declaration was promoted by Breitbart News, a platform for the pro-Trump alt-right, of which Bannon was the executive chairman, before joining the Trump Administration. One of the main stakeholders in Breitbart News is Mercer. Mercer is the co-C.E.O. of Renaissance Technologies, which is among the most profitable hedge funds in the country. A brilliant computer scientist, he helped transform the financial industry through the innovative use of trading algorithms. But he has never given an interview explaining his political views. Although Mercer has recently become an object of media speculation, Trevor Potter, the president of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, who formerly served as the chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said, “I have no idea what his political views are—they’re unknown, not just to the public but also to most people who’ve been active in politics for the past thirty years.” Potter, a Republican, sees Mercer as emblematic of a major shift in American politics that has occurred since 2010, when the Supreme Court made a controversial ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That ruling, and several subsequent ones, removed virtually all limits on how much money corporations and nonprofit groups can spend on federal elections, and how much individuals can give to political-action committees. Since then, power has tilted away from the two main political parties and toward a tiny group of rich mega-donors. Private money has long played a big role in American elections. When there were limits on how much a single donor could give, however, it was much harder for an individual to have a decisive impact. Now, Potter said, “a single billionaire can write an eight-figure check and put not just their thumb but their whole hand on the scale—and we often have no idea who they are.” He continued, “Suddenly, a random billionaire can change politics and public policy—to sweep everything else off the table—even if they don’t speak publicly, and even if there’s almost no public awareness of his or her views.” Through a spokesman, Mercer declined to discuss his role in launching Trump. People who know him say that he is painfully awkward socially, and rarely speaks. “He can barely look you in the eye when he talks,” an acquaintance said. “It’s probably helpful to be highly introverted when getting lost in code, but in politics you have to talk to people, in order to find out how the real world works.” In 2010, when the Wall Street Journal wrote about Mercer assuming a top role at Renaissance, he issued a terse statement: “I’m happy going through my life without saying anything to anybody.” According to the paper, he once told a colleague that he preferred the company of cats to humans. Several people who have worked with Mercer believe that, despite his oddities, he has had surprising success in aligning the Republican Party, and consequently America, with his personal beliefs, and is now uniquely positioned to exert influence over the Trump Administration. In February, David Magerman, a senior employee at Renaissance, spoke out about what he regards as Mercer’s worrisome influence. Magerman, a Democrat who is a strong supporter of Jewish causes, took particular issue with Mercer’s empowerment of the alt-right, which has included anti-Semitic and white-supremacist voices. Magerman shared his concerns with Mercer, and the conversation escalated into an argument. Magerman told colleagues about it, and, according to an account in the Wall Street Journal, Mercer called Magerman and said, “I hear you’re going around saying I’m a white supremacist. That’s ridiculous.” Magerman insisted to Mercer that he hadn’t used those words, but added, “If what you’re doing is harming the country, then you have to stop.” After the Journal story appeared, Magerman, who has worked at Renaissance for twenty years, was suspended for thirty days. Undaunted, he published an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer, accusing Mercer of “effectively buying shares in the candidate.” He warned, “Robert Mercer now owns a sizeable share of the United States Presidency.” Nick Patterson, a former senior Renaissance employee who is now a computational biologist at the Broad Institute, agrees that Mercer’s influence has been huge. “Bob has used his money very effectively,” he said. “He’s not the first person in history to use money in politics, but in my view Trump wouldn’t be President if not for Bob. It doesn’t get much more effective than that.” Patterson said that his relationship with Mercer has always been collegial. In 1993, Patterson, at that time a Renaissance executive, recruited Mercer from I.B.M., and they worked together for the next eight years. But Patterson doesn’t share Mercer’s libertarian views, or what he regards as his susceptibility to conspiracy theories about Bill and Hillary Clinton. During Bill Clinton’s Presidency, Patterson recalled, Mercer insisted at a staff luncheon that Clinton had participated in a secret drug-running scheme with the C.I.A. The plot supposedly operated out of an airport in Mena, Arkansas. “Bob told me he believed that the Clintons were involved in murders connected to it,” Patterson said. Two other sources told me that, in recent years, they had heard Mercer claim that the Clintons have had opponents murdered. The Mena story is one of several dark fantasies put forth in the nineties by The American Spectator, an archconservative magazine. According to Patterson, Mercer read the publication at the time. David Brock, a former Spectator writer who is now a liberal activist, told me that the alleged Mena conspiracy was based on a single dubious source, and was easily disproved by flight records. “It’s extremely telling that Mercer would believe that,” Brock said. “It says something about his conspiratorial frame of mind, and the fringe circle he was in. We at the Spectator called them Clinton Crazies.” Patterson also recalled Mercer arguing that, during the Gulf War, the U.S. should simply have taken Iraq’s oil, “since it was there.” Trump, too, has said that the U.S. should have “kept the oil.” Expropriating another country’s natural resources is a violation of international law. Another onetime senior employee at Renaissance recalls hearing Mercer downplay the dangers posed by nuclear war. Mercer, speaking of the atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, argued that, outside of the immediate blast zones, the radiation actually made Japanese citizens healthier. The National Academy of Sciences has found no evidence to support this notion. Nevertheless, according to the onetime employee, Mercer, who is a proponent of nuclear power, “was very excited about the idea, and felt that it meant nuclear accidents weren’t such a big deal.” Mercer strongly supported the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be Trump’s Attorney General. Many civil-rights groups opposed the nomination, pointing out that Sessions has in the past expressed racist views. Mercer, for his part, has argued that the Civil Rights Act, in 1964, was a major mistake. According to the onetime Renaissance employee, Mercer has asserted repeatedly that African-Americans were better off economically before the civil-rights movement. (Few scholars agree.) He has also said that the problem of racism in America is exaggerated. The source said that, not long ago, he heard Mercer proclaim that there are no white racists in America today, only black racists. (Mercer, meanwhile, has supported a super PAC, Black Americans for a Better Future, whose goal is to “get more Blacks involved in the Republican Party.”) “Most people at Renaissance didn’t challenge him” about politics, Patterson said. But Patterson clashed with him over climate change; Mercer said that concerns about it were overblown. After Patterson shared with him a scientific paper on the subject, Mercer and his brother, Randall, who also worked at the hedge fund, sent him a paper by a scientist named Arthur Robinson, who is a biochemist, not a climate expert. “It looked like a scientific paper, but it was completely loaded with selective and biased information,” Patterson recalled. The paper argued that, if climate change were real, future generations would “enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life.” Robinson owns a sheep ranch in Cave Junction, Oregon, and on the property he runs a laboratory that he calls the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. Mercer helps subsidize Robinson’s various projects, which include an effort to forestall aging. Patterson sent Mercer a note calling Robinson’s arguments “completely false.” He never heard back. “I think if you studied Bob’s views of what the ideal state would look like, you’d find that, basically, he wants a system where the state just gets out of the way,” Patterson said. “Climate change poses a problem for that world view, because markets can’t solve it on their own.” Magerman told the Wall Street Journal that Mercer’s political opinions “show contempt for the social safety net that he doesn’t need, but many Americans do.” He also said that Mercer wants the U.S. government to be “shrunk down to the size of a pinhead.” Several former colleagues of Mercer’s said that his views are akin to Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Magerman told me, “Bob believes that human beings have no inherent value other than how much money they make. A cat has value, he’s said, because it provides pleasure to humans. But if someone is on welfare they have negative value. If he earns a thousand times more than a schoolteacher, then he’s a thousand times more valuable.” Magerman added, “He thinks society is upside down—that government helps the weak people get strong, and makes the strong people weak by taking their money away, through taxes.” He said that this mind-set was typical of “instant billionaires” in finance, who “have no stake in society,” unlike the industrialists of the past, who “built real things.” Another former high-level Renaissance employee said, “Bob thinks the less government the better. He’s happy if people don’t trust the government. And if the President’s a bozo? He’s fine with that. He wants it to all fall down.” The 2016 Presidential election posed a challenge for someone with Mercer’s ideology. Multiple sources described him as animated mainly by hatred of Hillary Clinton. But Mercer also distrusted the Republican leadership. After the candidate he initially supported, Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, dropped out of the race, Mercer sought a disruptive figure who could upend both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Patterson told me that Mercer seems to have applied “a very Renaissance Technologies way of thinking” to politics: “He probably estimated the probability of Trump winning, and when it wasn’t very high he said to himself, ‘O.K., what has to happen in order for this twenty-per-cent thing to occur?’ It’s like playing a card game when you haven’t got a very good hand.” Mercer, as it happens, is a superb poker player, and his political gamble appears to have paid off. Institutional Investor has called it “Robert Mercer’s Trade of the Century.” \n \n In the 2016 campaign, Mercer gave $22.5 million in disclosed donations to Republican candidates and to political-action committees. Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster who worked for the Trump campaign, said that Mercer had “catapulted to the top of the heap of right-of-center power brokers.” It’s worth noting that several other wealthy financiers, including Democrats such as Thomas Steyer and Donald Sussman, gave even more money to campaigns. (One of the top Democratic donors was James Simons, the retired founder of Renaissance Technologies.) Nevertheless, Mercer’s political efforts stand apart. Adopting the strategy of Charles and David Koch, the billionaire libertarians, Mercer enlarged his impact exponentially by combining short-term campaign spending with long-term ideological investments. He poured millions of dollars into Breitbart News, and—in what David Magerman has called “an extreme example of modern entrepreneurial philanthropy”—made donations to dozens of politically tinged organizations. Like many wealthy families, the Mercers have a private foundation. At first, the Mercer Family Foundation, which was established in 2004, had an endowment of only half a million dollars, and most of its grants went to medical research and conventional charities. But by 2008, under the supervision of Mercer’s ardently conservative daughter, Rebekah, the foundation began giving millions of dollars to interconnected nonprofit groups, several of which played crucial roles in propagating attacks on Hillary Clinton. By 2015, the most recent year for which federal tax records are available, the foundation had grown into a $24.5-million operation that gave large sums to ultraconservative organizations. On top of this nonprofit spending, Mercer invested in private businesses. He put ten million dollars into Breitbart News, which was conceived as a conservative counterweight to the Huffington Post. The Web site freely mixes right-wing political commentary with juvenile rants and racist innuendo; under Bannon’s direction, the editors introduced a rubric called Black Crime. The site played a key role in undermining Hillary Clinton; by tracking which negative stories about her got the most clicks and “likes,” the editors helped identify which story lines and phrases were the most potent weapons against her. Breitbart News has been a remarkable success: according to ComScore, a company that measures online traffic, the site attracted 19.2 million unique visitors in October. Mercer also invested some five million dollars in Cambridge Analytica, a firm that mines online data to reach and influence potential voters. The company has said that it uses secret psychological methods to pinpoint which messages are the most persuasive to individual online viewers. The firm, which is the American affiliate of Strategic Communication Laboratories, in London, has worked for candidates whom Mercer has backed, including Trump. It also reportedly worked on the Brexit campaign, in the United Kingdom. Alexander Nix, the C.E.O. of the firm, says that it has created “profiles”—consisting of several thousand data points—for two hundred and twenty million Americans. In promotional materials, S.C.L. has claimed to know how to use such data to wage both psychological and political warfare. “Persuading somebody to vote a certain way,” Nix has said publicly, “is really very similar to persuading 14- to 25-year-old boys in Indonesia to not join Al Qaeda.” Some critics suggest that, at this point, Cambridge Analytica’s self-promotion exceeds its effectiveness. But Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University, in North Carolina, recently published a paper, on Medium, calling Cambridge Analytica a “propaganda machine.” As important as Mercer’s business investments is his hiring of advisers. Years before he started supporting Trump, he began funding several conservative activists, including Steve Bannon; as far back as 2012, Bannon was the Mercers’ de-facto political adviser. Some people who have observed the Mercers’ political evolution worry that Bannon has become a Svengali to the whole family, exploiting its political inexperience and tapping its fortune to further his own ambitions. It was Bannon who urged the Mercers to invest in a data-analytics firm. He also encouraged the investment in Breitbart News, which was made through Gravitas Maximus, L.L.C., a front group that once had the same Long Island address as Renaissance Technologies. In an interview, Bannon praised the Mercers’ strategic approach: “The Mercers laid the groundwork for the Trump revolution. Irrefutably, when you look at donors during the past four years, they have had the single biggest impact of anybody, including the Kochs.” Last summer, Bannon and some other activists whom the Mercers have supported—including David Bossie, who initiated the Citizens United lawsuit—came together to rescue Trump’s wobbly campaign. Sam Nunberg, an early Trump adviser who watched Mercer’s group take over, said, “Mercer was smart. He invested in the right people.” Bannon and Rebekah Mercer have become particularly close political partners. Last month, when Bannon denounced “the corporatist, globalist media” at the Conservative Political Action Conference, in his first public appearance since entering the White House, Rebekah Mercer was part of his entourage. Bannon supports some initiatives, such as a major infrastructure program, that are anathema to libertarians such as Robert Mercer. But the Wall Street Journal has described Bannon joking and swearing on the deck of the Mercers’ yacht, the Sea Owl, as if he were a member of the family. Bannon assured me that the Mercers, despite all their luxuries, are “the most middle-class people you will ever meet.” Robert and Diana Mercer brought up their three daughters in a modest home near I.B.M.’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center, in Westchester County. The girls attended public schools, and Robert and Diana worried about paying three college tuitions. According to Donna D’Andraia, a family friend, Diana was a PTA member and a “tiger mom” who “made sure that the girls did all the right things—they were in the honor society, and stayed out of trouble.” D’Andraia recalled Diana saying that Robert was brilliant, but D’Andraia found it hard to tell, because “he was very quiet—he didn’t talk to anybody.” The eldest Mercer daughter, Jennifer, or Jenji, attended Stanford. Rebekah, the middle daughter, enrolled at Cornell and then transferred to Stanford. Majoring in biology and math, she graduated in 1996; a few years later, she got an M.A., in operations research. The youngest daughter, Heather Sue, “was the spitfire,” D’Andraia recalled. When Heather Sue was a junior in high school, she tried out to be a place kicker on the football team. She made it, and, after enrolling at Duke University, she joined its varsity squad. When the Duke coach refused to treat her as the equal of her male teammates, she sued the school for gender discrimination, and won two million dollars in damages. Ron Santavicca, Heather Sue’s high-school coach, described the Mercers, who still invite him to their Christmas parties, as “the salt of the earth.” He added, “The whole family is very determined. When they have a mission, they go after it.” In 1993, when Nick Patterson mailed Robert Mercer a job offer from Renaissance, Mercer threw it in the trash: he’d never heard of the hedge fund. At the time, Mercer was part of a team pioneering the use of computers to translate languages. I.B.M. considered the project a bit of a luxury, and didn’t see its potential, though the work laid the foundation for Google Translate and Apple’s Siri. But Mercer and his main partner, Peter Brown, found the project exciting, and had the satisfaction of showing up experts in the field, who had dismissed their statistical approach to translating languages as impractical. Instead of trying to teach a computer linguistic rules, Mercer and Brown downloaded enormous quantities of dual-language documents—including Canadian parliamentary records—and created code that analyzed the data and detected patterns, enabling predictions of probable translations. According to a former I.B.M. colleague, Mercer was obsessive, and at one point took six months off to type into a computer every entry in a Spanish-English dictionary. Sebastian Mallaby, in his 2010 book on the hedge-fund industry, “More Money Than God,” reports that Mercer’s boss at I.B.M. once jokingly called him an “automaton.” In 2014, Mercer accepted a lifetime-achievement award from the Association for Computational Linguistics. In a speech at the ceremony, Mercer, who grew up in New Mexico, said that he had a “jaundiced view” of government. While in college, he had worked on a military base in Albuquerque, and he had showed his superiors how to run certain computer programs a hundred times faster; instead of saving time and money, the bureaucrats ran a hundred times more equations. He concluded that the goal of government officials was “not so much to get answers as to consume the computer budget.” Mercer’s colleagues say that he views the government as arrogant and inefficient, and believes that individuals need to be self-sufficient, and should not receive aid from the state. Yet, when I.B.M. failed to offer adequate support for Mercer and Brown’s translation project, they secured additional funding from DARPA, the secretive Pentagon program. Despite Mercer’s disdain for “big government,” this funding was essential to his early success. Meanwhile, Patterson kept asking Mercer and Brown to join Renaissance. He thought that their technique of extracting patterns from huge amounts of data could be applied to the pile of numbers generated daily by the global trade in stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies. The patterns could generate predictive financial models that would give traders a decisive edge. In the spring of 1993, Mercer experienced two devastating losses: his mother was killed, in a car crash, and his father, a biologist, died six weeks later. With life’s precariousness made painfully clear, and with tuition bills mounting, he decided to leave I.B.M. for a higher-paying job at Renaissance. Brown made the leap, too. Renaissance was founded by James Simons, a legendary mathematician, in 1982. Simons had run the math department at Stony Brook University, on Long Island, and the hedge fund took a uniquely academic approach to high finance. Andrew Lo, a finance professor at M.I.T.’s Sloan School of Management, has described it as “the commercial version of the Manhattan Project.” Intensely secretive and filled with people with Ph.D.s, it has been sensationally profitable. Its Medallion Fund, which is open only to the firm’s three hundred or so employees, has averaged returns of almost eighty per cent a year, before fees. Bloomberg News has called the Medallion Fund “perhaps the world’s greatest moneymaking machine.” In “More Money Than God,” Mallaby, who interviewed Mercer, describes his temperament as that of an “icy cold poker player”; Mercer told him that he could not recall ever having had a nightmare. But Mercer warms up when talking about computers. In the 2014 speech, he recalled the first time he used one, at a science camp, and likened the experience to falling in love. He also spoke of the government lab in New Mexico. “I loved the solitude of the computer lab late at night,” he said. “I loved the air-conditioned smell of the place. I loved the sound of the disks whirring and the printers clacking.” The speech lasted forty minutes—“more than I typically talk in a month,” he noted. Patterson told me that when Mercer arrived at Renaissance the firm’s equities division was lagging behind other areas, such as futures trading. Mercer and Brown applied their algorithms to equities trading. “It took several years,” Patterson recalled, but the equities group eventually accounted for the largest share of the Medallion Fund’s profits. Mercer and Brown’s code took into account nearly every conceivable predictor of market swings; their secret formula became so valuable that, when a pair of Russian mathematicians at the firm tried to take the recipe elsewhere, the company initiated legal action against them. Renaissance’s profits were further enhanced by a controversial tax maneuver, which became the subject of a 2014 Senate inquiry. According to Senate investigators, Renaissance had presented countless short-term trades as long-term ones, improperly avoiding some $6.8 billion in taxes. The Senate didn’t allege criminality, but it concluded that Renaissance had committed “abuses.” The I.R.S. demanded payment. (Renaissance defended its practices, and the matter remains contested, leaving a very sensitive material issue pending before the Trump Administration.) The Medallion Fund made Renaissance employees among the wealthiest people in the country. Forbes estimates that Simons, who has the biggest share, is worth eighteen billion dollars. In 2009, Simons stepped aside, to focus on philanthropy, and named Mercer and Brown co-C.E.O.s. Institutional Investor’s Alpha estimates that, in 2015, Mercer earned a hundred and thirty-five million dollars at Renaissance. \n \n Mercer’s fortune has allowed him and his family to indulge their wildest material fantasies. He and Diana moved into a waterfront estate in Head of the Harbor, a seaside community on Long Island, and called the property Owl’s Nest. Mercer, a gun enthusiast, built a private pistol range there. (He is also a part owner of Centre Firearms, a company that claims to have the country’s largest private cache of machine guns, as well as a weapon that Arnold Schwarzenegger wielded in “The Terminator.”) At Owl’s Nest, Mercer has installed a $2.7-million model-train set in his basement; trains chug through a miniature landscape half the size of a basketball court. The toy train attracted unwanted tabloid headlines, such as “Boo-hoo over 2m Choo-choo,” after Mercer sued the manufacturer for overcharging him. (The case was settled.) Mercer retains a domestic staff that includes a butler and a physician; both accompany him whenever he travels. But this, too, has sparked bad publicity. In 2013, three members of the household staff sued to recover back wages, claiming that Mercer had failed to pay overtime, as promised, and that he had deducted pay as punishment for poor work. One infraction that Mercer cited as a “demerit” was a failure to replace shampoo bottles that were two-thirds empty. This suit, too, was settled. Mercer has bought several spectacular yachts, including the Sea Owl, which is two hundred and three feet long. A 2013 photo shows the gates of the Tower Bridge, in London, raised high to allow it to proceed up the Thames. The Sea Owl has a crew of eighteen, and features a hand-carved “tree” that twists through four levels of decks. Designed, in part, as a place where the extended Mercer family can gather, the yacht has many fanciful and didactic touches for the Mercer grandchildren, such as frescoes that allude to the discoveries of Darwin and Newton. There’s a self-playing Steinway, a spa pool, and an elevator. Mercer has given major credit to his family for the yacht’s special details, telling Boat International that they are “endowed with both exceptionally good taste and exceptionally strong opinions.” The Mercer daughters are indeed forceful. When a Manhattan bakery that the sisters loved, Ruby et Violette, threatened to close, depriving the Mercers of their favorite cookies, they bought it. In a Fox News interview, Heather Sue recalled telling the others, “We are going to buy a bakery!” The Mercers still own the business, although it is now online-only. After graduating from Duke, Heather Sue began competing in high-stakes poker tournaments; she is admired on the circuit for her cool manner. When Mercer insisted that Heather Sue take a security guard with her, Santavicca said, “they became friends, then they became whatever, and now they’re married, with two beautiful daughters.” Jenji has a law degree from Georgetown, but she has pursued an interest in horses instead. In 2008, the Mercers bought a horse farm in Wellington, Florida, for $5.9 million. Jenji and Diana regularly attend the Winter Equestrian Festival, in Palm Beach. They are investors in an equestrian center in North Carolina, and have announced plans to open one in Colorado. Diana is also listed as the owner of Equinimity, a horse stable in Florida. According to the stable’s Web site, it specializes in Equine Facilitated Learning, a system that teaches “non-verbal leadership and interpersonal communication skills through non-predatory horse-inspired wisdom.” Rebekah worked for a few years at Renaissance after graduating from Stanford. A former colleague recalls her as smart but haughty. In 2003, she married a Frenchman, Sylvain Mirochnikoff, who is a managing director of Morgan Stanley. They had four children and bought a twenty-eight-million-dollar property—six apartments joined together—at Trump Place, on the Upper West Side. Now forty-three, she is divorcing Mirochnikoff. She homeschools the children, but in recent years she has become consumed by politics. “She is the First Lady of the alt-right,” Christopher Ruddy, the owner of the conservative outlet Newsmax Media, said. “She’s respected in conservative circles, and clearly Trump has embraced her in a big way.” Amity Shlaes, the conservative writer and the chair of the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, where Rebekah Mercer is a trustee, told me, “In the dull crowds of policy, the Mercers are enchanting firecrackers.” She likened the Mercer sisters to the Schuylers—the high-spirited, witty sisters made famous by the musical “Hamilton.” Shlaes went on, “The Mercers have strong values, they’re kind of funny, and they’re really bright. Their brains are almost too strong.” Rebekah, she noted, supports several think tanks, but grows tired of talk; she “is into action.” \n \n After the Citizens United decision, in 2010, the Mercers were among the first people to take advantage of the opportunity to spend more money on politics. In Oregon, they quietly gave money to a super PAC—an independent campaign-related group that could now take unlimited donations. In New York, reporters discovered that Robert Mercer was the sole donor behind a million-dollar advertising campaign attacking what it described as a plan to build a “Ground Zero Mosque” in Manhattan. The proposed building was neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. The ads, which were meant to boost a Conservative Party candidate for governor, were condemned as Islamophobic. “I love a hearty soup.” In Oregon, the Mercers gave six hundred and forty thousand dollars to a group that attacked Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, with a barrage of negative ads during the final weeks of his 2010 reëlection campaign. This effort also failed—it didn’t help when DeFazio announced that a New York hedge-fund manager and his daughter were meddling in Oregon politics. Press accounts speculated that Robert Mercer may have targeted DeFazio because DeFazio had proposed a tax on a type of high-volume stock trade that Renaissance frequently made. But several associates of Mercer’s say that the truth is stranger. DeFazio’s Republican opponent was Arthur Robinson—the biochemist, sheep rancher, and climate-change denialist. The Mercers became his devoted supporters after reading Access to Energy, an offbeat scientific newsletter that he writes. The family has given at least $1.6 million in donations to Robinson’s Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. Some of the money was used to buy freezers in which Robinson is storing some fourteen thousand samples of human urine. Robinson has said that, by studying the urine, he will find new ways of extending the human life span. Robinson holds a degree in chemistry from Caltech, but his work is not respected in most scientific circles. (The Oregon senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, has called Robinson an “extremist kook.”) Robinson appears to be the source of Robert Mercer’s sanguine view of nuclear radiation: in 1986, Robinson co-authored a book suggesting that the vast majority of Americans would survive “an all-out atomic attack on the United States.” Robinson’s institute dismisses climate change as a “false religion.” A petition that he organized in 1998 to oppose the Kyoto Protocol, claiming to represent thirty thousand scientists skeptical of global warming, has been criticized as deceptive. The National Academy of Sciences has warned that the petition never appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, though it is printed in “a format that is nearly identical to that of scientific articles.” The petition, however, still circulates online: in the past year, it was the most shared item about climate change on Facebook. Robinson, who calls himself a “Jesus-plus-nothing-else” Christian, has become a hero to the religious right for homeschooling his six children. Robert and Rebekah Mercer have praised a curriculum that Robinson sells. (An advertisement for it casts doubt on evolution: “No demonstration has ever been made of the process of ‘spontaneous origin of life.’ ”) Robinson has said that the “socialist” agenda of public schools is “evil” and represents “a form of child abuse.” \n \n Even though 2010 was a successful election year for Republicans, the candidates that the Mercers had supported in Oregon and New York both lost decisively. Their investments had achieved nothing. Wealthy political donors sometimes make easy marks for campaign operatives. Patrick Caddell, the former pollster, told me, “These people who get so rich by running businesses get so taken in when it comes to politics. They’re just sheep. The consultants suck it out of them. A lot of them are surrounded by palace guards, but that’s not true of the Mercers.” By 2011, the Mercers had joined forces with Charles and David Koch, who own Koch Industries, and who have run a powerful political machine for decades. The Mercers attended the Kochs’ semiannual seminars, which provide a structure for right-wing millionaires looking for effective ways to channel their cash. The Mercers admired the savviness of the Kochs’ plan, which called for attendees to pool their contributions in a fund run by Koch operatives. The fund would strategically deploy the money in races across the country, although, at the time, the Kochs’ chief aim was to defeat Barack Obama in 2012. The Kochs will not reveal the identities of their donors, or the size of contributions, but the Mercers reportedly began giving at least a million dollars a year to the Kochs’ fund. Eventually, they contributed more than twenty-five million. The Mercers also joined the Council for National Policy, which the Times has described as a “little-known club of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the country.” The Mercers have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars. The group swears participants to secrecy. But a leaked 2014 roster revealed that it included many people who promoted anti-Clinton conspiracy stories, including Joseph Farah, the editor of WorldNetDaily. The group also brought the Mercers into the orbit of two people who have become key figures in the Trump White House: Kellyanne Conway, who was on the group’s executive committee, and Steve Bannon. In 2011, the Mercers met Andrew Breitbart, the founder of the fiery news outlet that bears his name, at a conference organized by the Club for Growth, a conservative group. They were so impressed by him that they became interested in investing in his operation. Breitbart, a gleefully offensive provocateur, was the temperamental opposite of Robert Mercer. (In 2010, Breitbart told this magazine, “I like to call someone a raving cunt every now and then, when it’s appropriate, for effect.”) Nevertheless, the Mercers were attracted to Breitbart’s vision of “taking back the culture” by building a media enterprise that could wage information warfare against the mainstream press, empowering what Breitbart called “the silenced majority.” Breitbart soon introduced the Mercers to Steve Bannon. For a while, Breitbart News operated out of office space that Bannon owned in Santa Monica. A Harvard Business School graduate, Bannon had worked at Goldman Sachs, but he eventually left the world of finance and began making political films. His ambition, apparently, was to become the Michael Moore of the right. In the aughts, he directed polemical documentaries, among them “Fire from the Heartland” and “District of Corruption.” A former associate of Bannon’s in California recalls him as a strategic thinker who was adept at manipulating the media. A voracious reader, he was quick and charming, but, according to the former associate, he had a chip on his shoulder about class. He often spoke of having grown up in a blue-collar Irish Catholic family in Richmond, Virginia, and of having served as a naval officer when he was young. Bannon seemed to feel excluded from the social world of Wall Street peers who had attended prep schools. He had left Goldman Sachs, in 1990, without making partner, and, though he was well off, he had missed out on the gigantic profits that partners had made when the company went public, in 1999. In 2011, Bannon drafted a business plan for the Mercers that called for them to invest ten million dollars in Breitbart News, in exchange for a large stake. At the time, the Breitbart site was little more than a collection of blogs. The Mercers signed the deal that June, and one of its provisions placed Bannon on the company’s board. Nine months later, Andrew Breitbart died, at forty-three, of a heart attack, and Bannon became the site’s executive chairman, overseeing its content. The Mercers, meanwhile, became Bannon’s principal patrons. The Washington Post recently published a house-rental lease that Bannon signed in 2013, on which he said that his salary at Breitbart News was seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Under Bannon’s leadership, the Web site expanded dramatically, adding a fleet of full-time writers. It became a new force on the right, boosting extreme insurgents against the G.O.P. establishment, such as David Brat, who, in 2014, took the seat of Eric Cantor, the Virginia congressman. But it also provided a public forum for previously shunned white-nationalist, sexist, and racist voices. One pundit hired by Bannon was Milo Yiannopoulos, who specialized in puerile insults. (He recently resigned from the site, after a video of him lewdly defending pederasty went viral.) In 2014, Bannon began hosting a radio show that often featured Patrick Caddell, who effectively had been banished by Democratic Party leaders after years of tempestuous campaigns and fallings-out. On the air, Caddell floated dark theories about Hillary Clinton, and often sounded a lot like Bannon, describing “economic nationalism” as the driving force in American politics. Under Barack Obama, he said, America had turned into a “banana republic.” “Now that we’ve fallen in love, I have a confession. I’m not a giraffe—I’m fifty-eight weasels in a trenchcoat.” By 2016, Breitbart News claims, it had the most shared political content on Facebook, giving the Mercers a platform that no other conservative donors could match. Rebekah Mercer is highly engaged with Breitbart’s content. An insider there said, “She reads every story, and calls when there are grammatical errors or typos.” Though she doesn’t dictate a political line to the editors, she often points out areas of coverage that she thinks require more attention. Her views about the Washington establishment, including the Republican leadership, are scathing. “She was at the avant-garde of shuttering both political parties,” the insider at Breitbart said. “She went a long way toward the redefinition of American politics.” The Mercers’ investment in Breitbart enabled Bannon to promote anti-establishment politicians whom the mainstream media dismissed, including Trump. In 2011, David Bossie, the head of the conservative group Citizens United, introduced Trump to Bannon; at the time, Trump was thinking about running against Obama. Bannon and Trump met at Trump Tower and discussed a possible campaign. Trump decided against the idea, but the two kept in touch, and Bannon gave Trump admiring coverage. Bannon noticed that, when Trump spoke to crowds, people were electrified. Bannon began to think that Trump might be “the one” who could shake up American politics. “Breitbart gave Trump a big role,” Sam Nunberg, the aide who worked on the early stages of Trump’s campaign, has said. “They gave us an outlet. No one else would. It allowed us to define our narrative and communicate our message. It really started with the birther thing”—Trump’s false claim that Obama was not born an American citizen—“and then immigration, and Iran. Trump was developing his message.” By 2013, Nunberg said, Trump, like others on Breitbart, was “hitting the establishment” by slamming the Republican leadership in Congress, including Paul Ryan. Nunberg added, “It wasn’t like Charlie Rose was asking us on.” \n \n The Mercer Family Foundation kept expanding its political investments. Between 2011 and 2014, it gave nearly eleven million dollars to the Media Research Center, an advocacy group whose “sole mission,” according to its Web site, “is to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media.” The group’s founder, L. Brent Bozell III, is best known for his successful campaign to get CBS sanctioned for showing Janet Jackson’s bared breast during the 2004 Super Bowl broadcast. The Mercers have been among the M.R.C.’s biggest donors, and their money has allowed the group to revamp its news site, and it now claims to reach more than two hundred million Americans a week. In 2012, the Mercer Family Foundation donated two million dollars to Citizens United, which had trafficked in Clinton hatred for years. During the Clinton Administration, David Bossie, the group’s leader, was a Republican congressional aide, and he was forced to resign after releasing misleading material about a Clinton associate. In 2008, Citizens United released a vitriolic film, “Hillary: The Movie.” Two years ago, after the group received an additional five hundred and fifty thousand dollars from the Mercers’ foundation, it filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding access to Hillary Clinton’s State Department e-mails. When the e-mails were released, her Presidential campaign became mired in negative news stories. Bannon has often collaborated with Bossie, producing half a dozen films with him. In 2012, Bossie suggested a new joint project: a movie that urged Democrats and independents to abandon Obama in the Presidential election. The film’s approach was influenced by polling work that Patrick Caddell had shared with Bannon. The data suggested that attacking Obama was counterproductive; it was more effective to express “disappointment” in him, by contrasting him with earlier Presidents. Caddell and Bannon made an unholy alliance, but they had things in common: both men were Irish Catholic sons of the South, scourges to their respective parties, and prone to apocalyptic pronouncements. “We hit it off right away,” Caddell told me. “We’re both revolutionaries.” Bannon was excited by Caddell’s polling research, and he persuaded Citizens United to hire Caddell to convene focus groups of disillusioned Obama supporters. Many of these voters became the central figures of “The Hope & the Change,” an anti-Obama film that Bannon and Citizens United released during the 2012 Democratic National Convention. After Caddell saw the film, he pointed out to Bannon that its opening imitated that of “Triumph of the Will,” the 1935 ode to Hitler, made by the Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl. Bannon laughed and said, “You’re the only one that caught it!” In both films, a plane flies over a blighted land, as ominous music swells; then clouds in the sky part, auguring a new era. The disappointed voters in the film “seared into me,” Bannon said, the fact that middle-class Americans badly wanted change, and could be lured away from the Democratic Party if they felt that they had been conned. In 2012, Citizens United’s foundation paid Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consultancy group founded by Bannon, three hundred thousand dollars for what it described to the I.R.S. as “fund-raising” services. Bossie told me that the tax filing must have been made in error: the payment was actually for Bannon’s “film development” work. Charitable groups are barred from spending tax-deductible contributions on partisan politics, yet, as Breitbart News noted at the time, “The Hope & the Change” was a “partisan” film “targeting Democrats” during an election year. Even so, the Mercers took a hefty tax deduction for their two-million-dollar donation to Citizens United. Bossie told me that “the Mercers are very interested in films.” Indeed, Rebekah Mercer is on the board of the Moving Picture Institute, a conservative group devoted to countering Hollywood liberalism with original online entertainment. Among its recent projects was a cartoon, “Everyone Coughs,” which spread the rumor that Hillary Clinton was mortally ill. The film ended by depicting an animated Clinton literally coughing herself to death.']",2,"– Two key facts about billionaire Robert Mercer: He is, in the words of a recent New Yorker profile, the ""reclusive hedge-fund tycoon behind the Trump presidency."" Second, the IRS is going after his Renaissance Technologies fund for nearly $7 billion in back taxes. All of which sets up a dicey situation for President Trump, as a story at McClatchy News Service explains. Mercer wants IRS chief John Koskinen booted from office, and he's pushing Trump to fire him before his five-year term expires in November. The president has not tipped his hand on whether he'll do that, but it makes for ""bad optics,"" per the chief ethics adviser in the George W. Bush White House. ""The guy’s got a big case in front of the IRS,"" says Richard Painter. ""He’s trying to put someone in there who’s going to drop the case. Is the president of the United States going to succumb to that?"" Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is a major political player on the right as well, ramped up political contributions to conservative groups after the IRS began investigating his fund's use of a complicated banking method known as ""basket options"" in 2010 to cut its tax bill, reports McClatchy. The method involves converting short-term gains on trades into long-term gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. The IRS does not comment on ongoing cases, but a Senate panel accused the fund of short-changing the agency of at least $6.8 billion. The company has maintained that it did nothing illegal. One thing that could work in the Mercers' favor: They have long ties to top Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Still, a Columbia professor says that even if the Mercers succeed in getting Koskinen fired, it's doubtful that would upend a years-long IRS case."
"['BALTIMORE (WJZ) — A Baltimore attorney defending a man accused of rape is now out of jail after authorities say they caught him trying to bribe the victim and a witness in the case. \n \n Christos Vasiliades faces a litany of charges, including obstruction of justice and witness intimidation. \n \n “This is terrible. This is as bad as it gets. You’ve got an officer of the court, who is supposed to uphold the law, really attempting to induce a witness not to testify,” says Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh. \n \n Vasiliades’ lawyer released the following statement: \n \n “The State has the enormous burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Unless and until the State proves each and every allegation to a near certitude, Mr. Vasiliades is innocent.” \n \n The investigation into Vasiliades began back in April, when he is accused of contacting the victim his client, Mario Aguilar-Delossantoso, is accused of raping, along with a witness in the case. \n \n During that meeting, he reportedly warned the victim and witness of the increased risk of deportation if they were to testify in court. He also offered to pay them is they didn’t show up to court and dropped the charges. \n \n Frosh says the local attorney tried to take advantage of a climate of fear in Baltimore’s immigrant population. Many who are afraid to report crimes. \n \n “We’ve heard rumblings that these kinds of actions go on, but we haven’t been able to prove it. In this case, we have a taped conversation,” Frosh says. \n \n The victim contacted police, and agreed to wear a recording device when they met up with Vasiliades again. \n \n They met with Vasiliades again on May 18, and during that meeting, he ordered everyone to keep their cell phones in the lobby, and didn’t allow them to bring phones into the office. \n \n During that meeting, authorities say they caught Vasiliades on tape offering the victim and the witness $3,000 each if they didn’t show up to testify, and if the case got “thrown out.” \n \n On the recording court documents say Vasiliades tells the victim’s husband “you know how things are with Trump’s laws now; someone goes to court, and boom, they get taken away.” \n \n Vasiliades had a plan that on the court date, the victim and witness should wait outside the courthouse, with a man who would have the cash. When the case was “thrown out” after the didn’t appear to testify, Vasiliades would give the other man a thumbs up, and he would then give them the money. \n \n He also reportedly told the victim and witness that instead of testifying, they should take the money, then “find [Aguilar-Delossantoso] and wear him out,” and “if we were back home where I’m from, from Greece… we would go **** him up, that’s it, if you want to do that, that’s fine.” \n \n The indictment shows he also said, “$3,000, and then find him and kick his ass,” and, “I did my job, I did very good, and I can go home and go to sleep, OK, and then you get something, and then you find him outside, brother, and you **** him up, that’s it.” \n \n He also reportedly reiterated the increased chance of deportation if they were to testify. \n \n “Cases like this that really take us two steps backward are such a shame,” says Elizabeth Alex of CASA of Maryland. \n \n Alex says the organization has spent years trying to eliminate fear and encourage immigrant victims to report crimes. \n \n She hopes this isn’t a setback. \n \n “There is such a big and supportive environment here in Baltimore for these victims when they do come out, but its about getting the message to them that it’s not your fault and there’s people here to help,” Casa says. \n \n Frosh says if convicted, Vasiliades is facing a lot of jail time for most of the charges and could also lose his license to practice law. \n \n Vasiliades pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n \n Follow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook', 'A Baltimore defense attorney was arraigned Wednesday on charges of obstruction of justice and witness intimidation for allegedly trying to dissuade a rape victim from testifying against his client by telling her she risked deportation by the Trump administration. \n \n In a recorded conversation, Christos Vasiliades, 38, and another man charged in the case, Edgar Ivan Rodriguez, told the alleged victim\'s husband about the ""current environment for immigrants in this country"" and offered $3,000 cash if she did not show up to court, which would force prosecutors to drop the case, the indictment alleges. \n \n ""You know how things are with Trump\'s laws now; someone goes to court, and boom, they get taken away,"" Rodriguez told the victim\'s husband in the recorded conversation, according to an indictment by the Maryland attorney general\'s office. \n \n Vasiliades also offered an alternative solution: Just beat up his client. \n \n ""If we were back home where I\'m from, from Greece ... we would go (expletive) him up, that\'s it, if you want to do that, that\'s fine,"" Vasiliades was recorded saying, according to court documents. ""He\'s an (expletive), I think you should find him and kick his (expletive), personally."" \n \n Vasiliades was arrested Tuesday afternoon in the hallway of the Courthouse East building, as the trial of his client, Mario Aguilar-Delosantos, was set to start, according to the sheriff\'s office and court records. \n \n Vasiliades returned to that courthouse Wednesday afternoon — wearing a yellow jumpsuit and hands cuffed behind his back. Prosecutors agreed to release him and Rodriguez under pre-trial supervision. \n \n Rodriguez, who identified himself as Vasiliades\' interpreter, also was charged with obstruction of justice and witness intimidation, according to court records. \n \n Both pleaded not guilty. \n \n Billy Murphy, Vasiliades\' attorney, and Joseph Murtha, Rodriguez\'s attorney, left the courthouse without commenting. \n \n The charges against Aguilar-Delosantos come amid heightened concerns for immigrants as the Department of Justice steps up immigration enforcement. Arrests by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement were up 40 percent in the first 100 days of the Trump administration. \n \n ""If you\'re an immigrant, you live in a climate of fear at this point, and these folks were trying to capitalize on that,"" Attorney General Brian Frosh told The Baltimore Sun. \n \n The Baltimore state\'s attorney\'s office issued a memo to prosecutors recently, advising them to consider the ""potential consequences to the victim, witnesses, and the defendant"" in minor, nonviolent crimes. \n \n City prosecutors were handling the rape case, and asked the attorney general\'s office to get involved due to a possible conflict, Frosh said. \n \n The state\'s attorney\'s office declined to comment on the case but said it ""has and will continue to partner and combine our efforts with the attorney general\'s office, not only in protecting immigrant populations but also in the prosecution of these individuals."" \n \n Aguilar-Delosantos, of the unit block of South Broadway in Fells Point, is charged with second-degree rape, third- and fourth-degree sex offenses, and second-degree assault. The incident dates to March 25, 2016, and he has been free on $250,000 bond. \n \n As a result of his attorney\'s arrest, his trial date has been pushed back to August. \n \n The attorney general\'s office said in court papers that Rodriguez was present for and participated in the meetings in which Vasiliades attempted to dissuade the alleged victim and her husband from testifying in court. \n \n The indictment alleges Vasiliades contacted the victim\'s husband in April and said the case ""had become \'more complicated\'"" and that Vasiliades wanted to meet to discuss the case. \n \n At that meeting, the victim\'s husband said Vasiliades and Rodriguez warned of the potential risk for the couple if they testified in court. They ""explained that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would likely be present in the courtroom for their client … and cited new federal laws and policies and maintained there is a high risk that"" they would be deported if they testified in court, according to the indictment. \n \n Vasiliades said his client was ""very sorry and could offer compensation if they did not come to court and testify against him."" \n \n ""Vasiliades and Rodriguez indicated that the monetary compensation would help ensure that [they] would not get deported,"" the indictment says. \n \n On May 15, the victim\'s husband placed a phone call to Vasiliades at the direction of law enforcement and said he wanted to meet to discuss the offer. They agreed to meet three days later, and the victim\'s husband wore a recording device provided by law enforcement. \n \n Vasiliades made everyone place their cell phones on a desk in the lobby of the building where the meeting took place, then led them into an office, according to the indictment. Vasiliades and Rodriguez said ICE was ""looking at this case"" regarding their client, and cited recent immigration statistics. \n \n ""They\'re going to ask, \'You have your documents?\'"" Rodriguez was recorded saying, according to the indictment. \n \n Vasilades offered to give the victim $3,000, the indictment alleges. He said Rodriguez would wait outside the courthouse holding the cash. Once the case was dropped, Vasiliades said he\'d walk outside and give a thumbs up to Rodriguez, who would then deliver the cash, the indictment said. \n \n Then Vasiliades suggested assaulting his client. ""Find him and wear him out,"" he said, according to the indictment. \n \n Vasiliades has been an attorney since 2011, working for Murtha\'s firm. In one of his online biographies, he was described as an ""aggressive trial attorney dedicated to client service."" \n \n He is related to the Vasiliades family that owns the Sip & Bite diner in Canton.

Law enforcement and advocates across the country have expressed concern that the undocumented are not reporting crimes because they fear being deported under new policies. \n \n Vasiliades — who boasts of a ""stellar reputation"" on his website — could not be reached for immediate comment on the allegation he used those policies to threatened a crime victim. He was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday afternoon. \n \n He was representing Mario Aguilar-Delossantos in a rape case when he called the victim\'s husband in April and said things had become ""complicated"" and asked to meet. \n \n That night, he and an associate serving as a Spanish interpreter sat down with the couple at a restaurant and warned them that immigration agents would be in the courtroom for their client and that they could be deported, too, prosecutors charged. \n \n The couple reported the incident to law enforcement and authorities were listening in when the husband called Vasiliades a few weeks later and said he wanted to meet to talk more about the offer. \n \n “ I think you should find him and kick his ass, personally.” \n \n The next day, the group gathered again in an office, and this time the husband was wearing a wire when the attorney warned that his client would finger the victim as someone who is in the country illegally. \n \n ""My guy\'s going to be like, \'I\'m here, but she is too!\'"" the lawyer said, according to the indictment. ""They\'re going to ask, \'You have your documents?\' Then everybody\'s f-----."" \n \n He said that on the trial date, the couple should wait outside the courthouse, where the attorney\'s associate, Edgar Rodriguez, would be holding the cash, authorities alleged. If the case was thrown out because the victim didn\'t show up, the lawyer would emerge and give a thumb\'s up so they could collect the money, the indictment said. \n \n Vasiliades said that ""back home"" in Greece, the matter would have been handled with street justice. ""I think you should find him and kick his ass, personally,"" the attorney allegedly told the husband. \n \n He also cautioned the couple not to say anything about his proposal on the phone, and collected their cellphones during the meeting. However, he apparently failed to checked to see if they were wearing recording devices.']",3,"– A now-deleted website for Christos Vasiliades described him as an ""aggressive"" Baltimore attorney ""dedicated to client service."" Authorities say he's so dedicated, in fact, that he tried to bribe an alleged rape victim so she wouldn't testify against his client, suggested that she beat him up instead, and threatened her with deportation, reports the Baltimore Sun. Vasiliades, 38, was arrested in court Tuesday after the husband of the alleged victim told authorities about an offer he'd made the couple during an April meeting. During a second meeting on May 18, during which the victim's husband wore a wire, Vasiliades allegedly said his client was ""very sorry"" and would pay $3,000 if the couple failed to show up to his trial for assault, rape, and other sex offenses. Referring to his client, Vasiliades said that in his home country of Greece, ""we would go [expletive] him up,"" according to an indictment. ""I think you should find him and kick his ass, personally,"" he reportedly added, per NBC News. Vasiliades also told the couple there was a ""high risk"" they would be deported if they appeared in court because immigration officials would be present, authorities say. ""You know how things are with Trump's laws now; someone goes to court, and boom, they get taken away,"" he allegedly said. ""This is terrible. This is as bad as it gets,"" Maryland AG Brian Frosh tells CBS Baltimore, adding to the Sun that ""if you're an immigrant, you live in a climate of fear at this point, and these folks were trying to capitalize on that."" Vasiliades and his interpreter were arraigned Wednesday on charges of obstruction of justice and witness intimidation. Both pleaded not guilty."
"['With financial help from his father and other partners, Mr. Balin opened the Matrix in 1965, designing the stage to accommodate a six-member band. Jefferson Airplane was the first band to play there, and it went on to perform frequently at the club, both on its own and as a backup band for visiting bluesmen. It was the first psychedelic San Francisco band to sign to a major label, RCA, and it released its debut album, “Jefferson Airplane Takes Off,” in 1966. \n \n Grace Slick replaced Ms. Anderson, and Spencer Dryden took over the drums from Skip Spence before the release of the second Jefferson Airplane album, “Surrealistic Pillow,” in 1967, the year of the Summer of Love. “White Rabbit” and “Somebody To Love” — two songs Ms. Slick brought to the band — became Top 10 hits. (Mr. Kantner and Ms. Anderson died in 2016, Mr. Dryden in 2005 and Mr. Spence in 1999.) \n \n For Mr. Balin, Jefferson Airplane was focused on live performance, not commercial formula. “We got to a place where the music was playing us, we weren’t playing it,” he told Relix magazine in 1993. “That’s where you want to get to. And from the first note you hit, no matter where you are, even in the biggest hall in the world, from the first note of the first song, you know at that moment you are there or you’re not.” \n \n Mr. Balin stayed with Jefferson Airplane through three more studio albums that have endured as psychedelic touchstones: “After Bathing at Baxter’s,” “Crown of Creation” and “Volunteers,” for which he and Mr. Kantner wrote the title track. Yet the escalating tension within the band, along with his sorrow at the death of a friend, Janis Joplin, in 1970, led to his departure from Jefferson Airplane in 1971. \n \n Mr. Kantner invited Mr. Balin to complete a song that became “Caroline” on Jefferson Starship’s 1974 album, “Dragon Fly,” with Mr. Balin on lead vocals. He joined the band as a full member in 1975 and was its frontman for pop successes including “Miracles,” “Count on Me,” “Runaway” and “With Your Love” before leaving in 1978.', 'Marty Balin, a co-founder of Jefferson Airplane and a member of its later incarnation Jefferson Starship, whose high and soulful voice defined many of both groups’ songs, died Thursday, his rep confirmed. He was 76; the cause of death was not announced. \n \n His wife, Susan Joy Balin, was “by his side,” according to the announcement. \n \n Although Balin had his greatest impact as one of the architects of the musical counterculture during his 1965-71 tenure in Jefferson Airplane, he had his greatest commercial success when he rejoined the remnants of that group a few years later in Jefferson Starship, as the sole lead singer on both of that band’s singles to reach the top 10, “Miracles” in 1975 and “Count on Me” in 1978. \n \n He was a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, having been inducted with other members of the Airplane in 1996. It was 20 years later that the band received the Recording Academy’s lifetime achievement award, with Patti Smith writing in the Grammy Awards’ program book about her appreciation for “the soaring combination of Grace Slick’s acerbic wit and fearless charisma and the romantic purity of Marty Balin.” \n \n Born Martyn Jerel Buchwald, Balin was a young folksinger in San Francisco when he formed a band with fellow folkie Paul Kantner, who specialized in 12-string guitar. The pair teamed up with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady, drummer Skip Spence and singer Signe Anderson as the Jefferson Airplane and released their debut album, “Jefferson Airplane Takes Off,” in 1966. Anderson and Spence soon left the band and were replaced by Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden, respectively, and the group’s 1967 album “Surrealistic Pillow” — featuring the Slick-sung hits “White Rabbit” and “Somebody to Love,” along with several songs co-written by Balin — vaulted the group into superstardom. The harmonies between Slick, Balin and Kantner became a signature of the group’s sound. \n \n Balin was a galvanizing member of both the band and the San Francisco scene, and in 1965 helped launch a club in the city called the Matrix that hosted many groups of the era, ranging from the Airplane, the Doors and Janis Joplin to the Velvet Underground. He sold his interest in the club after the Airplane’s star began to rise. \n \n Jefferson Airplane issued several more albums into the early 1970s and played at both Woodstock and Altamont (where he was famously knocked out by a Hell’s Angel after trying to intervene amid the violence). \n \n The group splintered in the early 1970s but several members, including Slick and Kantner, reunited as Jefferson Starship in the mid-‘70s, and Balin was persuaded to reunite with his former partners during the recording of their debut album. His high tenor voice became a centerpiece of the group’s sound via hits like “Miracles” and “With Your Love.” That group splintered as well before reuniting without Balin several years later as a pure pop outfit under the abbreviated name Starship. \n \n Balin went solo and enjoyed a top 10 hit of his own in 1981 with the song “Hearts.” In 1989, he joined up with a short-lived Airplane reunion tour and returned four years later to Jefferson Starship, finally leaving for good in 2008. His final solo album, “The Greatest Love,” was released in early 2016. \n \n He underwent open-heart surgery in 2016 and later sued New York’s Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital for medical malpractice, claiming multiple injuries from the operations. Balin’s illness rendered him unable to attend the Grammys when the Airplane was awarded lifetime achievement honors, but he released a statement at the time, saying, “”I am grateful for the beautiful musical journey my life continues to take. To all my fellow Jefferson Airplane Band members, through its various metamorphoses, I thank you for a dream come true.” \n \n In a statement, Susan and Balin’s family issued a statement that noted how Balin “also enjoyed painting all his life. He painted vibrant, large-scale portraits of many of the most influential musicians and good friends Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Jerry Garcia, to name a few.” \n \n “Marty was the one who started the San Francisco scene,” says Bill Thompson, Balin’s roommate back in the mid-’60s and former manager of both Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship. \n \n “Back in those days Marty was quite the businessman,” said Paul Kantner, who passed away in 2016. “He was the leader of the band on that level. He was the one who pushed us to do all the business stuff, orchestrating, thinking ahead, looking for managers and club opportunities. He was very good at it.” \n \n Balin is survived by Susan, daughters Jennifer Edwards and Delaney Balin, and stepdaughters Rebekah Geier and Moriah Geier. \n \n “Marty and I shared the deepest of love — he often called it Nirvana — and it was,” Susan Balin said in a statement. “But really, we were all touched by his love. His presence will be within my entire being forever.”', 'Jefferson Airplane vocalist-guitarist Marty Balin, who co-founded the San Francisco psychedelic rock band in 1965 and played a crucial role in the creation of all their 1960s albums, including Surrealistic Pillow and Volunteers, died Thursday at the age of 76. Balin’s rep confirmed the musician’s death to Rolling Stone, though the cause of death is currently unknown. \n \n “RIP Marty Balin, fellow bandmate and music traveler passed last night,” Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady said in a statement. “A great songwriter and singer who loved life and music. We shared some wonderful times together. We will all miss you!!!!” \n \n “Marty and I were young together in a time that defined our lives,” Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen wrote on his blog. “Had it not been for him, my life would have taken an alternate path I cannot imagine. He and Paul Kantner came together and like plutonium halves in a reactor started a chain reaction that still affects many of us today. It was a moment of powerful synchronicity. I was part of it to be sure, but I was not a prime mover. Marty always reached for the stars and he took us along with him.” \n \n Born Martyn Jerel Buchwald, Balin was a struggling folk guitarist on the San Francisco scene when he formed a band with Paul Kantner after meeting the 12-string guitarist at a hootenanny. They met up with Kaukonen, Casady, drummer Skip Spence and singer Signe Toly Anderson, and cut their 1966 debut LP, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off. They developed a strong following around the budding San Francisco rock scene, but became nationwide superstars in 1967 when Anderson left the group and was replaced by Grace Slick. \n \n Balin co-wrote five songs on their breakthrough LP, Surrealistic Pillow, including “Comin’ Back to Me” and album opener “She Has Funny Cars,” and his tenor voice became a key component of their signature sound. He played with the group at all of its most famous gigs, including the 1967 Human Be-In in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, the Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock and Altamont. At the latter gig, Balin was brutally beaten by the Hells Angels after he dived into the audience to help an audience member in distress. “I woke up with all these boot marks all over my body,” he told Relix in 1993. “I just walked out there. I remember Jorma saying, ‘Hey, you’re a crazy son of a bitch.’ ” \n \n A little over a year later, Balin quit the group. “I thought everybody [was] kind of an asshole,” he said earlier this year. “It was a period of cocaine then.…Everybody took cocaine. And people I would work with, they would yell at you and it got intense. The Airplane was on that kind of trip. You know, I personally just drank alcohol. But some of the chemicals made people crazy and very selfish, and it just wasn’t any fun to be around for me. So I bailed.” \n \n Balin spent a few years managing rock bands in San Francisco, but he was pulled back into the group’s orbit by Kantner in 1974, though by that point Casady and Kaukonen had defected and the remaining members were billing themselves as Jefferson Starship. The offshoot band was incredibly successful and scored more hits than the original Airplane, including the Balin-penned “Miracles,” from Red Octopus, hitting Number Three in 1975. But by 1978, Balin grew tired of touring, especially since Slick’s alcohol issues caused many uneven performances, and he left the group for a solo career. In 1989, he participated in the short-lived Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and returned four years later to Jefferson Starship, finally leaving for good in 2008. \n \n In 2016, Balin underwent open-heart surgery at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He later sued for medical malpractice, claiming negligence caused him a myriad of injuries, including a paralyzed vocal cord, bedsores, kidney damage, and the loss of his left thumb and half his tongue.', ""Published on Sep 2, 2008 \n \n From the LP Surrealistic Pillow \n \n \n \n The summer had inhaled and held its breath too long \n \n The winter looked the same, as if it never had gone \n \n And through an open window where no curtain hung \n \n I saw you, I saw you, comin' back to me \n \n \n \n One begins to read between the pages of a look \n \n The shape of sleepy music, and suddenly you're hooked \n \n Through the rain upon the trees, that kisses on the run \n \n I saw you, I saw you, comin' back to me \n \n \n \n You came to stay and live my way \n \n Scatter my love like leaves in the wind \n \n You always say you won't go away \n \n But I know what it always has been, it always has been \n \n \n \n A transparent dream beneath an occasional sigh \n \n Most of the time I just let it go by \n \n Now I wish it hadn't begun \n \n I saw you, yes I saw you, comin' back to me \n \n \n \n Strolling the hills overlooking the shore \n \n I realize I've been here before \n \n The shadow in the mist could have been anyone \n \n I saw you, I saw you, comin' back to me \n \n \n \n Small things like reasons are put in a jar \n \n Whatever happened to wishes wished on a star? \n \n Was it just something that I made up for fun? \n \n I saw you, I saw you, comin' back to me""]",4,"– A major figure in the emergence of psychedelic rock in the 1960s has died. Marty Balin, who co-founded Jefferson Airplane and played on and off with its later iteration, Jefferson Starship, died en route to the hospital in Tampa, Florida, at age 76, reports the New York Times. The cause of death wasn't immediately known. The Times calls Balin a ""prime mover in the flowering of psychedelic rock in mid-1960s San Francisco,"" not only through the band he co-founded in 1965 but through a nightclub he owned called the Matrix. Rolling Stone has a detailed obituary on Balin's interesting career, noting that he was a struggling folk guitarist when he met another guitarist named Paul Kantner and decided to form a band. Other original Airplane members were guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady, drummer Skip Spence, and singer Signe Toly Anderson, but the band didn't truly take off until Anderson left and was replaced by Grace Slick in 1967, notes Rolling Stone. Balin wrote or co-wrote many of the songs, and his ""high and soulful"" voice became a signature sound for the group, per Variety. (Here is ""Comin' Back to Me."") But he was also a savvy businessman, as this old quote from the late Kanter shows: “He was the leader of the band on that level. He was the one who pushed us to do all the business stuff, orchestrating, thinking ahead, looking for managers and club opportunities. He was very good at it.”"

""State leaders in power keep forcing people to opposite corners to prepare for a fight instead of coming together to get things done."" \n \n Davis has said that her experience going from being a single teen mother living in a trailer to a successful Harvard-trained attorney in the Texas Senate informed her political views. She said Texas needed to be ""a lot less lone and a lot more star."" \n \n ""Until the families who are burning the candle at both ends can finally make ends meet, we will keep going. Until the amazing health care advances being pioneered in this state reach everyone who needs them, we will keep going,"" she said to about 1,500 people at the Wiley G. Thomas Coliseum. \n \n Davis then blasted ""the current leadership"" in Austin for creating a partisan atmosphere and appealing to the right wing of the Republican party. \n \n ""Texans deserve better than failed leaders who dole out favors to friends and cronies behind closed doors,"" she said. ""It\'s time for a governor who believes that you don\'t have to buy a place in Texas\' future. It\'s time for a governor who believes that the future of Texas belongs to all of us."" \n \n Republican Gov. Rick Perry has chosen not to seek re-election next year. The front-runner for the GOP nomination is Attorney General Greg Abbott, who said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday that Davis is too liberal for Texas. \n \n Davis rose to national prominence in June for her nearly 13-hour filibuster against new abortion restrictions in Texas, but she didn\'t mention the subject Thursday. Instead, she talked about her 2011 filibuster to block passage of the state budget after the Republican majority cut $5 billion for public schools. \n \n Davis\' opponents plan to use her support for abortion rights to rally conservative Christian voters next fall. About 40 anti-abortion demonstrators marched outside the venue where Davis was speaking Thursday, and Texas Right to Life plans to begin airing an ad over the weekend that calls her an ""abortion zealot."" \n \n Abbott called her filibuster ""inconsequential"" and sought to tie her to President Barack Obama. \n \n ""Obama\'s political operation is the muscle behind Wendy Davis\' political operation,"" Abbott said. ""She is an extremist with regards to imposing the kind of spending and regulation that\'s reckless for government."" \n \n If her defense of abortion rights angered the right, it inspired Democrats who urged her to run for governor in 2014 and reinvigorate a party that hasn\'t won statewide office since 1994. Her speech in the Legislature also added to her donor list, both in Texas and across the country. \n \n ""I thought the filibuster was inspiring and it seems like she really cares about people,"" said Amanda Fisher, a 24-year-old from Dallas.

She\'s especially going to inspire women,"" Gearhart said. ""And there\'s a lot of us."" \n \n Davis must raise money quickly to compete with Abbott, He has already raised $25 million to her more than $1 million. \n \n Experts say Davis and the political action committees supporting her will need to spend about $40 million to make it a competitive campaign in Texas, where Democrats have not won more than 42 percent of the vote in the last three elections. \n \n But national Democratic support and changing state demographics give Davis a chance to end the party\'s 20-year losing streak in Texas, Democratic consultants say. \n \n Davis\' personal story _ from a trailer park to Texas Christian University to the Harvard Law School _ has captured the imagination of many of her supporters. \n \n She was a successful attorney when she decided to enter politics by challenging a veteran Republican state senator in Tarrant County in 2008. She narrowly won that race and a tough re-election bid in 2012, when most voters in her district cast ballots for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporter Paul J.

In her short tenure on the national scene, she has elicited an almost Pavlovian response from anti-woman blowhards. \n \n First, Fox News commentator Erick Erickson called Davis “Abortion Barbie.” Then, a twitter poster, @jefflegal, expressed his support for a gubernatorial bid by the Republican Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott by dismissing Davis as “Retard Barbie”—a rather artless insult that might not have gotten much attention, had the attorney general not tweeted back, “Jeff, thanks for your support.” And just last month, Abbott’s top political advisor, Dave Carney, stepped into the Davis-bashing fray again by tweeting an article from a conservative Texas blog that promised in its headline to explain “why Wendy Davis is too Stupid to be Governor.” \n \n There’s every reason to expect that, as a misogyny magnet, Davis, whom The New York Times has described as an Austin “fashion icon,” will be the gift that keeps on giving all through the upcoming campaign season. Her hair, her clothes, her pink sneakers; the fact that she’s unmarried; the fact that abortion is the issue that brought her to national prominence—all these things sexualize her to a degree that’s unusual for female politicians (as it any accident that Sarah Palin was always dripping with kids?) and they open her up to a very specific, and very ugly, form of woman-hate. \n \n The more hits Davis takes, the better is will be for the Democrats. It was, after all, a consistent pattern of gender-based disrespect that helped land Democrats their 2012 election victories in the U.S. Senate and the presidency. A long pile-up of Republican insults to women’s dignity, particularly in the area of reproductive rights, led President Obama to win the women’s vote by a 12-point margin. Women don’t always vote as a unified block; they’re by no means unanimous in their support for abortion rights, or for any of the pro-family social policies that tend, unhelpfully, to be classed together as “women’s issues.” But they have, in recent years, tended to come together in a common understanding when the “yuck factor” in politics – the macho posturing, the questionable remarks that cut away at women’s hard-won public dignity – just gets to be too much. \n \n Abbott, sensitized by outrage that followed his Twitter thank-you, has tried to backpedal, tweeting his supporters to “Stay positive. ” The admonition, however @Barbie-worthy, hasn’t done much to mollify his critics. The Republican party’s effort to rebrand itself to women doesn’t seem to be working out too well, either. A new United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection poll just this week found that 33 percent of the women surveyed felt that the party had drifted even further away from them since the 2012 election. Only 14 percent of women—and just 11 percent of women younger than 50—said that Republicans had moved closer in perspective to them. \n \n Message: we Barbies are no dummies. You can’t change a legacy of policies that insult and hurt women through the power of positive thinking.', 'Politics \n \n The summer’s Democratic hero, Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis — whose 13-hour filibuster against a Texas abortion-restricting bill catapulted her into the national spotlight — is set to be featured in the September issue of Vogue. \n \n The gushy profile, published online Thursday, details Davis’ personal story from a single teen mom to political star. \n \n “Looking back, I don’t know if I could do it again. But somehow you just have the energy to do what you have to do,�? she told Vogue of being a single mom and attending community college classes in the morning while she worked as a paralegal. “And the great thing was, after a year, I realized that college wasn’t only for other people.�? \n \n Davis’ hair struggles (she admitted to having “super-supercurly hair�?), clothing (“She loves to put on something nice, dresses by Chloé and Victoria Beckham, and Miu Miu heels or Louboutins�?), home life (she lives in a “Spanish-style town house�?) and speculation about a potential run for Texas governor are also prominently featured. \n \n In the profile, Davis revealed that she was not always interested in politics, finding such conversations boring when out with her second husband Jeff Davis, a lawyer and the youngest person to be elected to the Fort Worth city council. \n \n “I remember we’d go into restaurants and everyone wanted to talk politics, and I thought, God, this is soooo boring,�? she said. \n \n From bored with politics to Harvard law, law career to city council seat, and State Senate to household name, the profile delves into her potential run for governor. \n \n “I feel confident that the next campaign will sort itself out in due time,�? Davis wrote Vogue in an email after Republican Gov. Rick Perry announced he would not seek reelection. “For now my priorities remain the same—focusing on the work at hand and fighting to make Texas a great place for all families.�? \n \n The word “abortion�? — the practice she fought to protect after 20-weeks of pregnancy in her multi-hour filibuster — does not appear a single time in the nearly 3,000 word essay. The word “antiabortion�? appears three times. \n \n Since the Perry announcement, Davis has remained coy about her future plans. At the National Press Club last week, Davis said Texas needed a change, but would not reveal if she will run. \n \n “I can say with absolute certainty that I will run for one of two offices: Either my state Senate seat or the governor,�? she said at the Press Club. \n \n This week, a lawyer and lobbyist Robert Miller published a report claiming that “credible sources�? have told him Davis will run for governor in 2014. \n \n Davis posed in the Texas Capitol for her Vogue spread, titled “Stand and Deliver: After Her 12-Hour Filibuster, How Far Will Texas Senator Wendy Davis Run.�? \n \n Follow Caroline on Twitter']",3,"– Wendy Davis officially announced her candidacy for governor of Texas yesterday, and Judith Warner thinks she's exactly what Democrats need—and not just because of her filibuster-generated fame.

"['Today Marks a Significant Milestone in Our History \n \n Today FURIOUS 7 will reach $1 billion in worldwide box office grosses. This is the first time in Universal’s 103-year history that we have had a film achieve this level of success in its first run.

It is the only franchise of its kind to reach a total of MORE THAN $3.39 billion and counting. \n \n On behalf of all of us, I am incredibly proud of the motion picture team at Universal, the cast and filmmakers of the FAST & FURIOUS for all they have done to take our original idea and evolve it into a huge, global, blockbuster franchise. When our friend and colleague Paul Walker tragically passed away in the middle of production, our team, led by Jeff Shell and Donna Langley, and the filmmakers along with the cast and crew did what they do best: They focused on family first; then talked to the fans; then got to work on making a great film that we can all be proud of. We were all saddened and honored to be a part of Paul’s final career performance and to celebrate his defining role in our lives.', ""Universal’s “Furious 7” will cross $1 billion at the worldwide box office Friday, becoming the studio’s first film to reach that milestone in its initial release. \n \n “Furious 7” has grossed $735.2 million overseas in 17 days and $273.7 million in North America after 15 days — making it the fastest movie to reach $1 billion. “The Avengers,” “Avatar” and “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” had all crossed $1 billion in 19 days. Universal said the seven films in the franchise have totaled $3.392 billion in worldwide grosses. \n \n “Furious 7” is directed by James Wan and stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Jason Statham and Ludacris. \n \n It is the 20th film to take in $1 billion, with “Avatar” leading the list at $2.79 billion, followed by “Titanic” at $2.19 billion. Paramount’s “Transformers: Age of Extinction” had been most recent addition to the list last year with a $1.09 billion worldwide gross, which leaves it in 10th place. \n \n “We’re incredibly proud to watch ‘Fast & Furious’ take its place as the only original live-action franchise to reach these kinds of results at the box office,” said Nick Carpou, U’s head of domestic distribution. “Our cast, filmmakers and all of our Universal and ‘Fast’ family deserve credit for working so hard to make ‘Furious 7’ a huge success, and we look forward to continuing to watch the film grow over the next few weeks.” \n \n Related Universal's International Chief Duncan Clark on Bond, Grinch, Dolittle, Pokemon 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' Hits $39.3 Million Internationally \n \n “What started as a small film about the street racing sub-culture of East Los Angeles has become a global phenomenon, with ‘Furious 7’ shattering records in so many territories around the globe,” said Duncan Clark, president of international distribution. \n \n Universal said “Furious 7” chalked up the record for second-biggest worldwide opening weekend at $397.2 million behind only “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.” It was the studio’s highest-grossing domestic launch at $147.2 million and international opening at $250 million. \n \n “Furious 7” also set records as the highest opening weekend in 29 territories and has become Universal’s highest-grossing film in 26 territories. Its $63.5 million opening day in China set a record, demolishing the previous record of $36 million for “Transformers 4.” \n \n Ron Meyer, vice chairman of studio parent NBCUniversal, sent out a congratulatory note to the staff. \n \n “At Universal we have had franchises with strong results at the box office, including ‘Jurassic Park,’ ‘Despicable Me’ and the ‘Bourne’ series, and although we take great pride in these accomplishments, what distinguishes ‘Fast and Furious’ is that it is an original live action concept with an entirely diverse cast,” Meyer noted. “It is the only franchise of its kind to reach a total of more than $3.39 billion and counting.” \n \n Meyer also noted the unique circumstances created by star Paul Walker’s death in late 2013. \n \n “When our friend and colleague Paul Walker tragically passed away in the middle of production, our team, led by Jeff Shell and Donna Langley, and the filmmakers, along with the cast and crew, did what they do best: They focused on family first; then talked to the fans; then got to work on making a great film that we can all be proud of,” he said. “We were all saddened and honored to be a part of Paul’s final career performance and to celebrate his defining role in our lives.” \n \n UPDATE, 10:11 p.m. — Variety’s first story said that “Furious 7” is the first Universal film to go past $1 billion. It is actually the first Universal film to do so in its initial release. The studio’s “Jurassic Park” reached $1.044 billion after the 3D re-release in 2013."", 'Despite being in American theaters for less than a month, Furious 7 just grossed a billion dollars at the box office. For those keeping track at home, that is faster than any movie has ever hit the billion-dollar mark, according to Variety. It’s an impressive feat, but it should come as no surprise that a film all about speed has raced to the top of the box office and into the record books. \n \n The James Wan-directed film, which stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker, Ludacris, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, and Tyrese Gibson, hit the billion-dollar milestone in just 17 days. That coup let the film just squeak past the previous box office record jointly held by The Avengers, Avatar, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, which all crossed the billion-dollar mark in 19 days. \n \n “At Universal we have had franchises with strong results at the box office, including Jurassic Park, Despicable Me and the Bourne series, and although we take great pride in these accomplishments, what distinguishes Fast and Furious is that it is an original live action concept with an entirely diverse cast,” said Ron Meyer, vice chairman of studio parent NBCUniversal, in a congratulatory note. “It is the only franchise of its kind to reach a total of more than $3.39 billion and counting.” Furious 7 is the first film from Universal Studios to gross $1 billion. (Jurassic Park also crossed the threshold, but only after it was re-released in 3-D in 2013.) Thanks to the success of the “thrilling, ridiculous, and, yes, sad” film, the rumored Furious 8 is probably a go. (Hear that, Helen Mirren?) \n \n Furious 7 is the 20th film ever to reach the $1 billion benchmark and the first since last year’s Transformers: Age of Extinction. While Furious 7 may be roaring now, it still has a way to go if it wants to challenge Avatar for the title of all-time worldwide box office record holder. James Cameron’s special effects-laden sci-fi spectacular made a whopping $2.79 billion at the box office, which even a Na’vi wouldn’t sneeze at. Cameron also holds the record for second place in box office hauls for Titanic, which took in $2.19 billion (and the hearts of all who watched). \n \n Do you have what it takes? \n \n Test your knowledge of the Seven Kingdoms with Vanity Fair ’s Game of Unknowns. \n \n Make your predictions']",3,"– The elite club of movies that have grossed at least $1 billion worldwide gained a new member yesterday. Furious 7 became the 20th film to have ever passed the threshold, per BoxOfficeMojo's stats. And as Variety reports, it did so pretty fast and furiously: in a record 17 days. Though Universal has put out such successes as Jurassic Park and the Bourne series, it's the first film in the studio's 103-year history to make the list, notes Ron Meyer, the vice chairman of studio parent NBCUniversal, in a congrats letter. That list is topped by Avatar and its $2.79 billion take. All told, the Furious franchise has raked in $3.39 billion. Vanity Fair's response to the news? ""The rumored Furious 8 is probably a go.""

"['(CNN) -- The winter storm system that walloped the Midwest moved east Friday night, bringing with it not just snow but powerful winds -- all of which made travel perilous and last-minute Christmas shopping more complicated across several states. \n \n Earlier this week, blizzard-like conditions left many locales white less than a week before the holiday. Many communities in central Iowa, for instance, got about a foot of snow, and the city of Madison, Wisconsin, got 15.2 inches Wednesday and Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. \n \n This much snow generally isn\'t expected as the system moves east, hitting Ohio, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. But that doesn\'t mean there haven\'t been -- and won\'t still be -- plenty of headaches. \n \n Snow is hardly foreign to these areas. But the addition of strong winds, especially in mountainous areas and along the Great Lakes, makes staying on snow-slickened roads even harder. \n \n ""It\'s scary,"" Esther Boyer told CNN affiliate WDTN, soon after her car slid into a ditch Friday in western Ohio. ""I guess I was just driving too fast, and you should slow down a lot sooner."" \n \n The lone blizzard warning, in effect Friday night through 6 p.m. Saturday, was for parts of northern West Virginia and north-central Maryland. The National Weather Service predicts 8 to 12 inches of snow and sustained winds of up to 35 mph, with gusts blowing up to 60 mph. \n \n ""Strong winds will cause blowing and drifting of snow with blizzard conditions expected at times with visibilities of one quarter mile or less (and) wind chill temperatures in the single digits ... also possible,"" the agency\'s forecast said. ""Downed trees and power lines could result from the strongest gusts on Saturday."" \n \n More populated areas -- many of which, such as Buffalo, Cleveland and Erie, Pennsylvania, were seeing snow around 9 p.m. Friday -- are also expected to be hit hard. \n \n The latter two cities are among those facing a winter storm warning through 7 p.m. Saturday. The weather service\'s forecast calls for 5 to 7 inches of snow, with 10 inches possible in spots, plus regular winds approaching 30 mph and up to 45-mph gusts by Lake Erie. \n \n A similar warning applies to western Pennsylvania, where 5 to 9 inches of light to moderate snow -- some of it ""heavier, lake-enhanced snow"" -- and gusts as strong as 40 mph are expected. \n \n Even more snow, between 10 to 18 inches, is forecast farther south in Pennsylvania and in northern Maryland, with 50-mph gusts possible. \n \n ""A winter storm warning means that snow will make travel dangerous,"" the weather service said. ""If you must venture out at all, use extreme caution."" \n \n These advisories follow severe weather farther west that caused major problems earlier this week. \n \n While the city itself was largely spared of snow, Chicago\'s two airports -- O\'Hare and Midway -- were clogged with travelers due to flight cancellations. \n \n Blinding snow is blamed for a 30-car pileup on Interstate 35 near Fort Dodge, Iowa, that killed two people, said Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright. It was one of close to 100 weather-related accidents reported around the state by Thursday morning, according to Bright. \n \n CNN\'s Stefan Simons, Jim Kavanagh, Jareen Imam, Laura Smith-Spark, Carma Hassan and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.', 'Travelers facing canceled flights and closed roads were hoping to finally head to their holiday destinations as a widespread snowstorm that dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the Midwest moved across the Great Lakes toward Canada. \n \n CORRECTS NUMBER DEAD TO TWO INSTEAD OF THREE, AND LOCATION OF ACCIDENT TO INTERSTATE 35 INSTEAD OF INTERSTATE 80 - This photo provided by the Iowa State Patrol shows the scene of a 25-vehicle pileup that...

It was blamed for deaths in at least five states, with parts of Iowa and Wisconsin hit with more than a foot of snow. \n \n While some people went to work on digging themselves out even as the storm continued Thursday, others had less control: They were stuck waiting for word of new flight times. \n \n Most of the canceled flights were in Chicago, where aviation officials said more than 350 flights were called off at O\'Hare International Airport and more than 150 at Midway International Airport. \n \n Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. \n \n Erin Henderson is among the people hoping to get out of O\'Hare Friday morning. The 20-year-old college student was trying to return home to Kansas City after five months of studying abroad in Italy when she arrived in Chicago early Thursday evening to learn the last leg of her flight had been canceled. \n \n Exhausted and teary-eyed, Henderson said she planned to get some sleep in a nearby hotel before trying to catch a flight to St Louis early Friday. She said her father planned to drive across Missouri to get her. \n \n ""It was the closest I can get,"" Henderson said. \n \n In Madison, Wis., more than 19 inches of snow fell, prompting the University of Wisconsin at Madison to cancel Thursday\'s finals. Senior Elle Knutson, 21, said she spent most of the day in her apartment chatting with friends on the Internet and staring out her window at the snow. \n \n ""At first it was kind of nice, but I\'m going a little stir-crazy,"" Knutson said Thursday night. \n \n The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa, through Albert Lea, Minn. Iowa and Wisconsin activated National Guard troops to help rescue stranded drivers. \n \n In Iowa, two people were killed and seven injured in a 25-vehicle pileup. Drivers were blinded by blowing snow and didn\'t see vehicles that had slowed or stopped on Interstate 35 about 60 miles north of Des Moines, state police said. A chain reaction of crashes involving semitrailers and passenger cars closed down a section of the highway. \n \n Three other states also had traffic deaths that were blamed on the storm. There were at least two deaths in each Nebraska and Wisconsin, and one in Kansas. \n \n In southeastern Utah, a woman who tried to walk for help after her car became stuck in snow died Tuesday night. \n \n On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs in Alabama. \n \n The flight cancellations were getting a lot of attention because the storm came just a few days before Christmas. But Daniel Baker, CEO of flight tracking service FlightAware.com, called it ""a relatively minor event in the overall scheme of things."" \n \n By comparison, airlines canceled more than 13,000 flights over a two-day period during a February 2011 snowstorm that hit the Midwest.

Restoring normal road traffic in the region could take longer. (Dec. 21) AP \n \n Blizzard warnings were in effect in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, according to the National Weather Service. The Weather Channel reported that parts of 17 states are under winter weather advisories -- as far west as Washington state and as far east as Maine. \n \n The storm brought much-needed precipitation for drought-plagued regions but was bad news for holiday travelers. Most of the nation\'s big airlines responded to the storm\'s threat by enacting flexible rebooking policies for passengers scheduled to fly into the storm\'s path. \n \n The storm led airlines to cancel about 1,000 flights ahead of the Christmas holiday — relatively few compared to past big storms, though the number was climbing. \n \n More than 600 flights were canceled at Chicago\'s two airports, O\'Hare and Midway. O\'Hare is a major hub for both United and American, meaning the disruption could ripple out and affect fliers at other airports. \n \n MORE: Storm snarls flights in Chicago, Midwest \n \n Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. \n \n United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. \n \n American Airlines cancelled flights scheduled to depart after 8 p.m. CT on Thursday. \n \n The snowstorm walloped Iowa, where almost a foot of snow has fallen in Des Moines. State police said a 25-vehicle pileup killed at least two people, and across Iowa 30,900 customers were without power Thursday, including more than 25,000 in the Des Moines area. \n \n The storm dropped as much as 13 inches of snow on portions of central Iowa, paralyzed travel, knocked out power to scores of people and closed schools, government offices and businesses across the state. \n \n ""It\'s just awful out there,"" Capt. Mike Winter of the Iowa State Patrol said. ""People need to just stay home."" \n \n The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa through Albert Lea, Minnesota. \n \n Most major roads across Iowa remained closed either by official order or impassible due to snow and ice buildup late Thursday. \n \n The Iowa State Patrol said at least 88 crashes occurred on highways and interstate systems Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon. There were also at least 164 emergency calls from the public and 161 motorist assists. \n \n On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs Alabama. \n \n In southeastern Wisconsin, where a blizzard warning was in effect, sheriff\'s officials said slick conditions led to at least two fatalities late Wednesday when a driver lost control of his car in Rock County, about 90 miles northwest of Chicago. \n \n The weather service was forecasting ""thundersnow"" in Milwaukee and the surrounding areas, where snow could fall at the rate of 2-3 inches an hour. \n \n Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency, which put the state emergency government, National Guard, State Patrol and other agencies on high alert. \n \n At least two people in Nebraska died in crashes blamed on poor driving conditions, the State Patrol said. In many areas, drivers were being told to stay off the roads because of whiteout conditions. Most of I-80 in the state was closed. Nebraska\'s biggest school districts canceled classes, as did many districts across the region. \n \n In Utah, Washington County sheriff\'s detective Nate Abbott says the woman and a man were driving when their car got stuck in rural Washington County on Tuesday night during the storm that hit the Rocky Mountain region. \n \n He says the pair started walking for help, but the woman couldn\'t go any farther and sought shelter while the man continued on. Search-and-rescue teams later found her body. \n \n Although the Plains and Midwest could do without the travel headaches, precipitation should be welcome. \n \n More than 93% of the high Plains region and 54% of the Midwest are enduring drought conditions, according to Thursday\'s U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal website that tracks drought. \n \n Out west, the leading edge of a powerful storm system arrived in Washington, Oregon and Northern California. Rain is expected across Northern California from late Thursday through the weekend, with heavy snow possible in the Sierra Nevada range as the system moves east. \n \n Four to seven feet of snow is forecast to fall above 7,000 feet, prompting the U.S. Forest Service to issue an avalanche warning for Mount Shasta. \n \n Contributing: Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY; Michael Winter, USA TODAY; the Associated Press; The Des Moines Register \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/RHTLA8']",3,"– Seven people died across four states as a winter storm continued to tear through the Midwest, dumping more than a foot of snow on sections of Iowa and Wisconsin.

Weather warnings are in effect in 17 states spanning the lower 48, from Washington to Maine. But the National Weather Service says the Midwest storm should ""finally begin to wind down"" today; it's headed over the Great Lakes and into Canada. Meanwhile, some 1,000 flights have been canceled—actually a lower number than in previous storms, USA Today notes. About 600 of those were at Chicago's two airports, which could affect travelers elsewhere. Some 20,000 people have lost power in Iowa, particularly around Des Moines, CNN reports. The storm did bring some good news for students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which saw 19 inches of snow: Yesterday's final exams were cancelled."
"[""Tokyo condemns ‘absolutely unacceptable’ provocation, as Pyongyang reacts to imposition of new UN sanctions following missile tests \n \n We will sink Japan and turn US to 'ashes and darkness', says North Korea \n \n North Korea has threatened to sink Japan and said the US should be “beaten to death like a rabid dog” after the two countries spearheaded fresh UN security council sanctions in response to the regime’s recent nuclear test. \n \n The Korea Asia-Pacific peace committee, which oversees North Korea’s relations with the outside world, described the UN security council, which passed a new round of sanctions on Monday, as a “tool of evil” in the pay of Washington, and called for it to be broken up. \n \n 'Quite backwards': Chinese tourists gawk at impoverished North Koreans Read more \n \n It is the first time that Pyongyang has issued an explicit threat to Japan since it fired a medium-range ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido at the end of last month, triggering emergency sirens and mass text alerts. \n \n “The four islands of the [Japanese] archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche,” the committee said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. Juche is the ideology of self-reliance pioneered by Kim Il-sung, the country’s founder and grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un. \n \n “Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,” the committee added. \n \n The 15-member security council voted unanimously in support of a US-drafted resolution condemning the missile test and imposing measures that include a ban on North Korean textile imports and restrictions on oil exports to the country. \n \n \n \n In response, the committee said the US should be “beaten to death like a rabid dog” for the “heinous sanctions resolution”. \n \n “Let’s reduce the US mainland into ashes and darkness. Let’s vent our spite with mobilisation of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now,” it said. \n \n Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, described the statement as “extremely provocative and egregious”. \n \n He added: “It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable.” \n \n A new report has claimed that the detonation on 3 September of what North Korea claimed was a hydrogen bomb involved a device with an estimated yield of 250 kilotons – making it far more powerful than initially thought. \n \n The US-based 38 North website noted that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation had revised upwards the seismic power created by the test from magnitude 5.8 to 6.1. \n \n How has North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme progressed this year? Read more \n \n It added: “This revision is significant because, rather than providing an equivalent yield of about 120 kilotons derived from the lower magnitude estimates, the application of standard formula with appropriate constants shows that the yield can now be estimated to have been roughly 250 kilotons (one quarter megaton). \n \n “Regardless of whether this most recent test was an operational warhead for an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] or simply a device, the yield of the test clearly shows North Korean progress in increasing the yields of their nuclear weapons.” \n \n After weeks of heightened tensions and threats emanating from Pyongyang and Washington, there are signs that US and other officials may be attempting to engage the regime diplomatically. \n \n Play Video 2:10 UN Security Council steps up sanctions against N Korea – video \n \n Japan’s public broadcaster NHK claimed on Thursday that US and North Korean officials had met “secretly” on the sidelines of a security forum in Switzerland earlier this month. \n \n The report did not offer details, but said that Choe Kang-il, deputy director general for North American affairs at the North Korean foreign ministry, and Evans Revere, a former senior official at the state department, had raised North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. \n \n While Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has refused to consider negotiations unless Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons programme, an MP has claimed that support is rising inside the governing Liberal Democratic party for possible engagement with the regime. \n \n Antonio Inoki, a former professional wrestler, said he had spoken to several unnamed LDP MPs who supported sending a delegation of Japanese parliamentarians to Pyongyang in an attempt to defuse tensions. \n \n In the court of Kim Jong-un: a ruthless, bellicose despot, but not mad Read more \n \n “We are seeing a situation where [Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un] is raising his fist, and the situation is escalating,” said Inoki, who met North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Su-yong, and other officials during a trip to Pyongyang last week. “It’s important to see who can be the first to lower his fist and reduce tensions.” \n \n The 74-year-old, who has visited North Korea 32 times, said LDP lawmakers had become more receptive to the idea of dialogue. “The political wind has changed direction,” he said, adding that North Korean officials were receptive to the idea. “I made a proposal and was told they would be happy to receive such a delegation.” \n \n In another gesture apparently aimed at lowering the diplomatic temperature, South Korea’s government is considering an $8m (£6m) aid package for North Korea. \n \n Seoul suspended aid to North Korea, provided via UN agencies, after the regime conducted nuclear and missile tests in 2016. But under a proposal that could be approved next week, the South would provide $4.5m to a World Food Programme project to help infants and pregnant women, and $3.5m to Unicef, according to Yonhap news agency. \n \n “The government’s basic stance is that humanitarian assistance to those who are vulnerable in North Korea should be continued regardless of political considerations,” Yonhap quoted a unification ministry official in Seoul as saying. \n \n “Seoul plans to decide the details of the aid and its timing after taking into account the inter-Korean situation,” he added."", 'TOKYO (AP) — Japan\'s top government spokesman said Thursday that a North Korean threat to sink Japan with a nuclear bomb is ""extremely provocative and outrageous."" \n \n A statement from an organization called the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee attacked the United States for leading a push for stronger U.N. sanctions against North Korea, and railed against Japan for backing the U.S. campaign. \n \n ""The four islands of the (Japanese) archipelago should be sunken into the sea"" by a nuclear bomb, the statement reads in part. It was distributed by the Korean Central News Agency, the state news service. \n \n North Korea often issues bellicose threats that it doesn\'t actually carry out. But Japan\'s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, responding to a reporter\'s question about the North Korean dispatch, said the statement ""significantly escalates tension in the region and is absolutely unacceptable."" \n \n The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions Monday after North Korea carried out its sixth and strongest nuclear test on Sept. 3. Although the latest sanctions are not as tough as what the U.S. had sought, they are expected to have a significant impact.']",2,"– North Korea has made more of the kind of blood-curdling threats that the world found easier to shrug off before Pyongyang stepped up its nuclear program. The ""Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee,"" North Korea's state agency for dealing with the outside world, issued a statement Thursday calling for the islands of Japan to be ""sunken into the sea"" with nuclear bombs and for the US mainland to be reduced to ""ashes and darkness,"" the Guardian reports. ""Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,"" said the committee's statement, which also called for the US to be ""beaten to death like a rabid dog"" and denounced the United Nations Security Council as a ""tool of evil."" The committee called for the breakup of the Security Council, which imposed its toughest-ever sanctions on North Korea earlier this week. It called the council a ""money-bribed"" group that does whatever the US asks it to. Before the sanctions vote, which passed the 15-member council unanimously, Pyongyang warned that the US would face the ""greatest pain"" in its history. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Pyongyang's threat to sink the country is ""extremely provocative and outrageous,"" the AP reports. The statement ""significantly escalates tension in the region and is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said Thursday. (The world may have underestimated Pyongyang's latest nuclear test.)"
"['Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the 55-year-old younger brother of the Sultan, is seeking to persuade a judge in Manhattan that pictures of the four statues should not be shown to a jury that will consider his lawsuit against former legal advisers. \n \n He has also said the jury should not be told that he had several wives and mistresses, because “polygamy is offensive to many Americans”. \n \n The statues were once kept on the prince’s 28-acre estate on Long Island, New York. Mark Cymrot, a lawyer for one of the defendants in the lawsuit, said: “They make me blush. They’re very explicit”. \n \n The prince’s lawsuit, separate from the long-running legal dispute with his brother, accuses the advisers of mishandling his wealth and cheating him out of $7 million (£4.3 million). \n \n His lawyers said in court papers that Faith Zaman, who is being sued with her husband Thomas Derbyshire, obtained the photos of the statues “in order to embarrass” him. \n \n They also argued that details of love life should be excluded. “Prince Jefri was entitled to have multiple wives and families, and he did so,” the court papers said. “Under Islamic law and practice this was legitimate and proper. \n \n “However, polygamy is offensive to many Americans, and trial testimony about Prince Jefri’s personal life may be prejudicial to him.” The legal dispute between the sultan and the prince centres on the younger brother’s alleged embezzlement of $15 billion (£9 billion) after being put in charge of much of the oil-rich kingdom’s wealth. \n \n It has been dragged through courts in London, Malaysia and the Cayman Islands over the past decade. \n \n In 2007 the Privy Council – the final court of appeal for Brunei, a former British protectorate – ruled in support of a 2000 judgment ordering the prince to give his assets to his brother and live on a “monthly allowance” of $300,000 (£185,000). \n \n The assets included billions of pounds, hundreds of international properties including New York’s Palace Hotel, thousands of cars, artworks by Picasso and Renoir and a 180-foot yacht called Tits. \n \n Mr Cymrot said the defendants “stole nothing”. He added: “Jefri is trying to blame them for his own conduct in connection with his dispute with the sultan.”', 'Gag order issued in sex statue trial of Prince Jefri Bolkiah \n \n Two of the life-size sex statues belonging to Prince Jefri Bolkiah. \n \n Related News Articles \n \n Prince wants X-rated sex trophies out of court case \n \n After photos of Prince Jefri Bolkiah\'s collection of life-size sex statues appeared in the Daily News on Thursday, a Manhattan judge issued a gag order to everyone involved in the real estate trial. \n \n ""I\'m directing everybody to stop talking to the press,"" said Justice Ira Gammerman.

Jefri Bolkiah—who used to keep the statues on his 28-acre Long Island estate—is trying to persuade a judge that the statues and his polygamous lifestyle shouldn't be mentioned in his lawsuit against financial advisers whom he accuses of mismanaging his money, the Telegraph reports. ""Polygamy is offensive to many Americans, and trial testimony about Prince Jefri’s personal life may be prejudicial to him,"" his lawyers told the judge. The prince, the younger brother of the Sultan of Brunei, gave up much of his wealth to settle a lawsuit from the sultan accusing him of embezzling $15 billion.

He said Francis wanted to pray together with Benedict, so the two used a different kneeler in the pews and prayed side-by-side. \n \n Francis also brought a gift to Benedict, an icon of the Madonna, and told him that it\'s known as the ""Madonna of Humility."" \n \n ""I thought of you,"" Francis told Benedict. ""You gave us so many signs of humility and gentleness in your pontificate."" Benedict replied: ""Grazie, grazie."" \n \n Benedict wore the simple white cassock of the papacy, with a quilted white jacket over it to guard against the chill, but minus the sash and cape worn by Francis. Walking with a cane, he looked frail compared to the robust 76-year-old Argentine. \n \n Outside the villa, the main piazza of Castel Gandolfo was packed with well-wishers bearing photos of both popes and chanting ""Francesco! Francesco!"" But the Vatican made clear they probably wouldn\'t see anything. \n \n The Vatican downplayed the remarkable reunion in keeping with Benedict\'s desire to remain ""hidden from the world"" and not interfere with his successor\'s papacy. There was no live coverage by Vatican television, and only a short video and still photos were released after the fact. \n \n The Vatican spokesman said the two spoke privately for 40-45 minutes, followed by lunch with the two papal secretaries, but no details were released. \n \n All of which led to enormous speculation about what these two popes might have said to one another after making history together: Benedict\'s surprise resignation paved the way for the first pope from Latin America, the first Jesuit, and the first to call himself Francis after the 13th century friar who devoted himself to the poor, nature and working for peace. \n \n That the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was second only to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in the 2005 conclave that elected Ratzinger pope has only added to the popular imagination about how these two popes of such different style, background and priorities might get along. \n \n Perhaps over their primo, or pasta course during Saturday\'s lunch, they discussed the big issues facing the church: the rise of secularism in the world, the drop in priestly vocations in Europe, the competition that the Catholic Church faces in Latin America and Africa from evangelical Pentecostal movements. \n \n During their secondo, or second course of meat or fish, they might have gone over more pressing issues about Francis\' new job: Benedict left a host of unfinished business on Francis\' plate, including the outcome of a top-secret investigation into the leaks of papal documents last year that exposed corruption and mismanagement in the Vatican administration. Francis might have wanted to sound Benedict out on his ideas for management changes in the Holy See administration, a priority given the complete dysfunctional government he has inherited. \n \n Over coffee, they might have discussed future of Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, Benedict\'s trusted aide who has had the difficult task of escorting his old pope into retirement and then returning to the Vatican to serve his successor in the initial rites of the office. \n \n Gaenswein, who wept as he and Benedict made their final goodbyes to staff in the papal apartment on Feb. 28, has appeared visibly upset and withdrawn at times as he has been by Francis\' side. The Vatican has said Francis\' primary secretary will be Monsignor Alfred Xuereb, who had been the No. 2 secretary under Benedict. \n \n Both Xuereb and Gaenswein were present for lunch. Start to finish, the meeting lasted about 2 1/2 hours, with Benedict escorting Francis back to the helipad for the ride back to the Vatican. \n \n Benedict\'s resignation _ and his choices about his future _ have raised the not-insignificant question of how the Catholic Church will deal with the novel situation of having one reigning and one retired pope living side-by-side, each of them called ""pope,"" each of them wearing papal white and even sharing the same aide in Gaenswein. \n \n Before Benedict announced his decision to be known as ""emeritus pope,"" one of the Vatican\'s leading canon lawyers, the Jesuit Rev. Gianfranco Ghirlanda, penned an article suggesting that such a title would be inappropriate for Benedict since in renouncing the papacy he had ""lost all the power of primacy"" conferred on him by his election as pope. \n \n The alternate title _ which Vatican officials had suggested would be likely be chosen _ was that of ""emeritus bishop of Rome,"" since bishops routinely retire and are known as ""emeritus bishops."" \n \n But Benedict opted instead for ""emeritus pope,"" ""Your Holiness"" and also chose to keep wearing the white cassock of the papacy, leading to questions about both his own influence on the future pontiff and whether Catholics more favorable to his traditional style might try to undermine his successor\'s authority and agenda by keeping their allegiance to the old pope. \n \n Clearly aware of that potential, Benedict in his very last meeting with his cardinals on Feb. 28 pledged his ""unconditional reverence and obedience"" to the then-unknown future pope, who was nevertheless in the room. \n \n Lombardi said he understood Benedict repeated that pledge of obedience to Francis on Saturday. Asked how the popes addressed one another, Lombardi demurred, saying he didn\'t think they addressed one another as ""Your Holiness"" or ""Pope,"" saying the exchange was too familiar and warm for such titles. \n \n After a few months in Castel Gandolfo, Benedict is to return to the Vatican to live in a converted monastery in the Vatican gardens, just a short walk from St. Peter\'s Basilica and the shrine devoted to the Madonna where Francis went to pray on one of his first walks as pope. \n \n Despite Benedict\'s expressed intent to fade away, Francis on virtually every occasion afforded him has made clear he has no intention of letting his ""venerable predecessor"" disappear from memory: Francis called Benedict right after his election, urged prayers for him in his first papal Masses, and called the former Joseph Ratzinger to congratulate him on the feast of St. Joseph on March 19. \n \n The Vatican has similarly made clear that the ex-pope hasn\'t completely lost interest in the matters of the church, following on television Francis\'s inaugural appearance on the balcony of St. Peter\'s Basilica after his election, when he charmed the crowd with a simple ""Brothers and sisters, good evening."" \n \n The two men couldn\'t be more different in style and background: The Argentine-born Francis has made headlines with his simple gestures _ no papal regalia, simple black shoes, paying his own hotel bill _ and basic message that a pope\'s job is to protect the poor. \n \n As archbishop of Buenos Aires, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio worked in the slums, celebrating Masses for prostitutes and drug addicts. He plans to celebrate Holy Thursday Mass this week at a juvenile detention center, where he will wash the feet of 12 inmates in a show of humility echoing that of Jesus. \n \n The German-born Benedict is an academic, one of the world\'s leading theologians who spent more than 30 years in the frescoed halls of the Vatican where he was its chief doctrinal watchdog and then its pope. His primary concern was to remind Christians in Europe of their faith and bring back a more traditional Catholic identity, and with it many of the brocaded trappings of the papacy. His Holy Thursday Masses included the traditional foot-washing, but it involved clerics at the St. John Lateran basilica. \n \n While there is a difference in style, there is a ""radical"" convergence between the two men in terms of their spirituality, according to Civilta Cattolica, the Italian Jesuit magazine whose articles are approved by the Vatican before publication. \n \n ""They are two figures of the highest spirituality, whose relationship with life is completely anchored in God,"" the magazine wrote. ""This radicalness is shown in Pope Benedict\'s shy and kind bearing, and in Pope Francis it is revealed by his immediate sweetness and spontaneity."" \n \n ___ \n \n Nicole Winfield reported from Vatican City. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield', 'Media caption The BBC\'s Alan Johnson: ""We will never know the details of their talks"" \n \n Newly elected Pope Francis has met his predecessor for lunch, the first time such a meeting has been possible for more than 600 years. \n \n Pope Francis was flown by helicopter to Castel Gandolfo for the private lunch with Pope Emeritus Benedict. \n \n Benedict has lived at the lakeside castle south of Rome since last month, when he became the first pope in six centuries to resign, citing ill health. \n \n Cardinal Jorge Maria Bergoglio was elected to succeed him on 13 March. \n \n No known precedent \n \n There was no official communique on the results of the Pope\'s brief lunchtime visit to Castel Gandolfo, says the BBC\'s David Willey in Rome. \n \n Analysis There had been intense speculation about how Vatican protocol would deal with the first face to face meeting since the election of Pope Francis between the new Pope and the retired Pope. It was a carefully calculated mixture of formality and informality. Emeritus Pope Benedict embraced his luncheon guest on Pope Francis\' arrival at the helipad at the papal summer villa at Castel Gandolfo, which has become Benedict\'s temporary home. Benedict, who stepped down from the papacy at the end of February, wore a white padded jacket and looked rather frail in comparison to 76-year-old Pope Francis, nine years his junior. The two white-clad clerics then prayed together in the villa\'s private chapel where Pope Francis insisted on kneeling side by side with his predecessor, rather than using the padded papal kneeler prepared for him. ""No! we are brothers, we pray together!"" Francis told Benedict in a gesture of humility. \n \n On the agenda, some delicate handover details, including a top secret document prepared by the former pope on last year\'s scandal involving leaked documents, our correspondent adds. \n \n The new head of the Catholic Church is usually elected after the death of his predecessor, and there is no public record of any previous meeting between an incumbent pope and a former pope. \n \n In 1294, former hermit Celestine V resigned after five months as pope. Boniface VIII was elected days later, and had his predecessor imprisoned. Celestine was dead within a year. \n \n In contrast, Pope Francis has spoken warmly of his predecessor. \n \n One of his first acts as Pope was to call Benedict at Castel Gandolfo, where the former pontiff had been following proceedings on television. \n \n The pope emeritus is expected to stay on at the papal summer residence until new accommodation being prepared for him inside the walls of Vatican City is ready at the end of April. \n \n For his part, Pope Francis will begin the Church\'s most important liturgical season on Sunday with a Palm Sunday Mass in St Peter\'s Square. \n \n He will then lead six more liturgies during the week, culminating with the Easter Sunday Mass and Urbi et Orbi blessing. \n \n New style \n \n The new Pope chose the name Francis in honour of St Francis of Assisi - the 13th Century Italian saint who spurned a life of luxury to work with the poor. \n \n He has called for the Roman Catholic Church to be closer to ordinary people, especially the poor and disadvantaged. \n \n Castel Gandolfo retreat Picturesque lakeside ""castle town"" in the Alban hills, 15 miles (24km) south-east of Rome \n \n Dates back to the 17th Century; its gardens occupy the site of a residence of the Roman Emperor Domitian \n \n Benedict is staying at the palace while a permanent residence is readied inside the Vatican City walls \n \n He has a staff of two secretaries and four women helpers, and is guarded by Vatican police officers \n \n And, only 10 days into his pontificate, he has made some subtle but significant changes in the lifestyle of the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, says our correspondent. \n \n He dresses very simply, preferring to wear plain black shoes under a simple white habit rather than the red leather loafers and ermine-trimmed cape worn by his predecessor. \n \n The first Latin American Pope spurned a special car to take a bus with his cardinals after he was elected, and insisted on returning to his Rome hotel the next day to pay his own bill. \n \n And Pope Francis places himself on the same level as his guests, rather than greeting them from a throne on an elevated platform, which is seen as a powerful gesture after centuries of Vatican pomp. \n \n The former archbishop of Buenos Aires has also started inviting guests to his early morning Mass - including Vatican gardeners, street sweepers, kitchen staff and maids working at the hotel where he is currently staying.']",2,"– It's a Catholic first: A sitting pope met with his predecessor today. Pope Francis traveled to Castel Gandalfo outside Rome to visit with Pope emeritus Benedict, reports the BBC. The AP says both men paid deference to other other. When they entered a chapel, for instance, Benedict directed Francis to the front row, but Francis insisted they pray side-by-side. ""We are brothers,"" he said. The two met privately for 45 minutes, then had lunch. The Vatican didn't release any details about their discussion."
"[""Gov. Scott Walker will become the final top-tier candidate to join the GOP battle for the White House when he announces his bid from Wisconsin on Monday. \n \n Walker enters the race as the favorite to win Iowa’s caucuses and with high polling numbers and plenty of grassroots enthusiasm. \n \n He is a natural fit for the Iowa contest as a social and fiscal conservative from an adjacent state. And his appeal came into sharp focus when he captivated an Iowa audience in January with the tale of his battle against Wisconsin’s labor unions. \n \n But there are plenty of doubts, too, when it comes to whether Walker can be the GOP nominee. \n \n He faces a charisma question and is seen by some critics as a vanilla candidate from the Midwest who lacks the “wow” factor — the same liability that capsized the GOP candidacy of former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty in 2012. \n \n While competing with more exuberant rivals such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Donald Trump, Walker must show he can appeal to wide swathes of voters. \n \n He also must show he is ready for prime-time after stumbling earlier this year in national interviews over foreign policy, at one point comparing his battles with Wisconsin’s unions to how he’d take on Islamic terrorists. \n \n “This is the major leagues and the intensity is only going to get ramped up everyday,” says GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak. “He has to prove he can perform at a high level over the long haul.” \n \n A win in Iowa is the first crucial test, but it won’t guarantee his nomination. The last two winners of the Iowa GOP caucuses — former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in 2008 and former Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.) in 2012 — have faded in the primary contests that followed. \n \n “He’s clearly the frontrunner and there’s a lot of interest in him here,” said Craig Robinson, the former political director for the Iowa Republican Party. “But he still has a lot of work to do.” \n \n Following his presidential announcement at the Waukesha County Expo Center, Walker will spend one day each in Nevada, South Carolina and New Hampshire, before beginning an all-out blitz in Iowa that includes 11 stops over three days. \n \n He’ll be traveling the state in a Winnebago – the motor-homes manufacturer is based in Iowa – and he’s charted a course that will eventually take him to all 99 of the state’s counties. \n \n The Washington Post reports that following Walker’s initial Iowa blitz, he’ll begin campaigning in states with primaries and caucuses in early March, including Georgia, Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina. \n \n Walker trails Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in polls in New Hampshire, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) — who Walker has said would be a good vice presidential candidate on his ticket — is believed to be setting up a firewall in South Carolina. \n \n That raises the importance for Walker in winning Iowa and then bottling that momentum. \n \n “He has to win or show well in Iowa,” said GOP strategist Ford O’Connell. “If he doesn’t, he’s in real trouble.” \n \n \n \n Republicans laud Walker as a candidate with cross-party appeal, saying he has the potential to draw on Tea Party conservatives, social conservatives and establishment-minded Republicans. \n \n His fight against public sector unions has been front and center in his campaign. \n \n “It’s got to be the cornerstone of his pitch,” said O’Connell. “It’s got to be his bloody rallying cry that the liberals came after him three times with everything they had and he never wavered. “ \n \n Still, Republicans warn Walker against leaning too heavily on that one achievement. \n \n \n \n “It’s not enough,” said Robinson. “You can’t run solely on your biography, and so far, he’s been almost solely focused on that.” \n \n \n \n Republicans say he will need to find traction in other aspects of his record, particularly if he’s to go head-to-head with Bush. \n \n On the stump, where observers say Walker is getting better and better, he’s begun to broaden his argument. \n \n At the Republican Party’s Lincoln Day Dinner in suburban Detroit in May, Walker sought to highlight reforms he’s championed as governor. \n \n Walker said he cut taxes in Wisconsin by $2 billion, cut back on regulations, turned a $3.6 billion budget deficit into a half-billion dollar surplus, fully funded the state’s pension system and reduced unemployment from 9.2 percent to 4.6 percent, while achieving one of the highest labor participation rates in the country at 68 percent. \n \n \n \n “We transformed everything,” Walker declared. \n \n He has boasted about defunding Planned Parenthood in the state, signed concealed carry laws and enacted stricter voter ID laws. \n \n He also has re-upped his fight with labor unions, signing right-to-work legislation that bans the requirement that private-sector workers pay labor dues. \n \n Still, Walker’s record will come under fresh scrutiny. \n \n \n \n Republicans say he’ll need to be prepared to respond to criticism that he has flip-flopped on immigration reform and ethanol subsidies, while tacking to the right on abortion and same-sex marriage in an effort to appeal to social conservatives. \n \n Walker will also need to put forth concrete policy proposals, Republicans say, to match Rubio and other senators who are viewed as stronger on foreign policy. \n \n “He’s going to get pushed on this in the debates, and he’ll have to be confident and clear on his positions,” said Mackowiak. \n \n Bush and Rubio will loom over the primaries as Walker’s top competition, and his campaign appears to be readying for a protracted fight. \n \n After Iowa, Republicans say he’ll either be a frontrunner with a huge victory under his belt or a diminished former high-flyer struggling to hold on. \n \n \n \n “He’s starting off with a lot of chips on the table in Iowa,” said Mackowiak. \n \n Read more from The Hill: \n \n Walker announces: 'I'm running for president'"", 'Wisconsin Gov.

Instead, things here in Madison have been in turmoil for months — a complication for a governor building his presidential candidacy around his ability to get things done. Walker has spent much of the year feuding not only with Democrats — a fight he relishes — but also with fellow Republicans over proposals such as the Bucks’ arena. \n \n GOP lawmakers who usually work with him in lock step are questioning his budget priorities. Walker’s popularity also has fallen statewide, even as he pulls to the front of the crowded GOP presidential field nationally. Democrats, meanwhile, accuse Walker of using the budget and other issues to bolster his national résumé ahead of his 2016 run. \n \n “It was put together by the governor to help his presidential prospects with the most far-right-wing group of his party, and it reflects those values perfectly,” state Rep. Andy Jorgensen, a Democrat, said at a news conference last week. “I suspect that’s why he’s leading in Iowa. He’s at the top of the polls there . . . but in Wisconsin, meanwhile, he’s at 41 percent approval.” \n \n Walker introduced his two-year budget — dubbed “Our Freedom and Prosperity proposal” — in a speech in early February that sounded more like an audition for president than a fiscal road map. He promised to “help restore that American Dream right here in Wisconsin” by continuing to lower property taxes, freeze college tuition, consolidate economic development operations and reduce the size of the state government. \n \n For months, Walker confidently said he would not launch his presidential campaign until completing the budget, which he expected to do in June. Instead, lawmakers spent most of the month deadlocked. \n \n There wasn’t enough cash to pay for everything they wanted to do, partly the result of increasing costs, $2 billion in tax breaks since Walker took office and a stalled economy. And with Walker exerting less influence, other Republicans have been jockeying for power and leverage. For a month, Republican leaders canceled all public budget meetings and instead met behind closed doors. Meanwhile, Walker loosened the timing of his presidential announcement, saying it is not unusual for the budget process to drag on for so long. \n \n In an ad titled, ""Scott Walker for America,"" the Republican governor from Wisconsin said he\'s hoping to ""make our country great again."" (Scott Walker) \n \n The budget finally passed last week — saving Walker from embarrassment but giving him only a few days to review it and veto individual provisions before he signed it Sunday. \n \n Lawmakers presented Walker with red-meat legislation that he can brag about on the GOP campaign trail: right-to-work legislation, expansion of school-voucher use, repeal of a 48-hour waiting period for those looking to purchase guns, mandatory drug testing for food-stamp recipients and a ban on all abortions after 20 weeks. \n \n At the same time, Walker also had to retreat on a series of key issues, including abandoning plans to consolidate economic development operations and restructuring the University of Wisconsin system. \n \n The Bucks’ arena in particular put Walker at odds with fellow Republicans and local conservative radio hosts. Last year, longtime owner and former Democratic senator Herb Kohl sold the Bucks to New York hedge fund managers Marc Lasry, a major Democratic fundraiser, and Wesley Edens. The new owners agreed to keep the team in Wisconsin — but only if they got a new arena by 2017. \n \n Walker proposed in January that taxpayers split the cost of a new $500 million arena with the former and new owners. In the past, taxpayers helped pay for building complexes for the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team and the Green Bay Packers football team. But those teams are much more popular than the Bucks — Walker admitted that he had not been to a game in years — and Republicans questioned the major expense during a tough budget period. \n \n As time passed, the project became less and less popular. In early June, Walker tried an alternative argument: It would be cheaper in the long run to build the arena and keep the basketball team, along with the income taxes that the state collects from players, than to lose the Bucks to another state. \n \n “The price of doing nothing is not zero,” Walker said at a news conference, standing behind a sign reading: “Cheaper to keep them.” \n \n The sales pitch did not work. Several Republicans, especially those from rural areas far from Milwaukee, said they couldn’t support the project. Walker then tried to gather support from urban Democrats whom he largely had ignored for the past few years. Most Democrats have declined to take a stance, instead asking why the state has money for a new arena as it is slashing funding for schools. \n \n Finally, to get the budget through before Walker’s 2016 announcement, Republican legislative leaders decided to take the Bucks’ arena out of the budget and deal with it later. \n \n Another major stumbling block in the budget was transportation funding. Walker had proposed using $1.3 billion in loans to pay for highway projects, which several Republicans called financially irresponsible. Some suggested increasing car registration fees to generate some cash, but Walker refused to do that. \n \n “At some point, your credit card is maxed out, and you can’t do any more,” state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) said in a TV interview in early June. “When Governor Walker proposed $1.3 billion in borrowing — I just think that is irresponsible. . . . I would prefer to pay as we go. That’s a conservative position.” \n \n Lawmakers eventually agreed to a lower level of borrowing and to delay a number of projects. \n \n Late on the night of July 2, on the eve of the Independence Day weekend and two days into the new fiscal year, lawmakers were able to advance the budget out of committee. But then came a new controversy — an amendment gutting the state’s open-records law that had been slipped into the budget. \n \n The proposed change would have made Wisconsin’s law one of the most restrictive in the country, no longer allowing journalists, activists and others to request to see lawmakers’ e-mails and legislative drafting notes. Such a change, retroactive to July 1, also would have further protected Walker as he enters the presidential race and finds his record under greater scrutiny. \n \n For days, no one would take credit for the proposal. Then on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R) outed the governor’s office for having helped draft it. \n \n Walker said in a radio interview Friday that although his office offered suggestions on the topic, the proposal “didn’t come from us.” \n \n The final complication came Wednesday evening, when the state Assembly was taking up the budget, as a bomb threat cleared the state capitol for several hours. \n \n Once the threat was cleared, lawmakers returned to their chamber to debate for several more hours, to pass the budget and then to send it to the governor. On Friday morning, Walker was asked on Sykes’s radio show to assess the budget that lawmakers rushed to get to him before his announcement. \n \n “All in all,” he said, “it’s pretty good.”']",2,"– Make room, GOPers: Scott Walker is running for president. ""I'm in. I'm running for president because Americans deserve a leader who will fight and win for them,"" he tweeted (this time for real) today. But for the Wisconsin governor—who dropped a ""barn-burner of a speech"" on February's CPAC and boasted he can take on ISIS—there are, as the Hill puts it, both ""high expectations and doubts."" What could boost his run: his record in Wisconsin on cutting taxes and unemployment, his strong stance against organized labor, and the potential to win Iowa's caucuses based on ""high polling numbers and plenty of grassroots enthusiasm,"" per the Hill. He's not a shoe-in, though. ""He's clearly the frontrunner and there’s a lot of interest in him here,” a former Iowa Republican Party official tells the paper. ""But he still has a lot of work to do."" Part of that work will involve breaking away from what the Hill calls his image ""as a vanilla candidate from the Midwest who lacks the 'wow' factor"" to compete with more engaging candidates. Other issues: The Hill notes that critics will go after his foreign policy weaknesses, as well as lob accusations that he's ""flip-flopped"" on immigration. He'll also have to defend fiscal problems back in Wisconsin, adds Washington Post, including an embarrassingly late budget and financing for a new stadium for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks—a deal that's been called a ""hot mess."" Finally, Walker may need to break from what some see as a one-platform campaign focused on unions. ""You can't run solely on your biography, and so far, he’s been almost solely focused on that,"" the ex-IRP official tells the Hill. (Then there's Walker's lack of a college degree.)"

"['FLINT, Mich. — It was the Fourth of July, a warm summer night in 2014, but Tim Monahan was shivering in a thick blanket as he watched fireworks from his front yard here. By the next afternoon his temperature had shot to 104.6, and doctors at the hospital he had checked into puzzled over what was wrong. \n \n Two days later, they had an answer: Legionnaires’ disease, a virulent form of pneumonia caused by a type of bacteria that can multiply in water systems. Mr. Monahan, now 58, was given antibiotics and eventually recovered, but his case turned out to be at the leading edge of a Legionnaires’ outbreak that sickened at least 87 people in the Flint region, killing nine of them, from June 2014 through October 2015. \n \n State officials still say they cannot conclusively link the outbreak to Flint’s contaminated water supply, partly because sputum cultures were not collected from patients. But the possibility of a link was raised in internal government emails as early as October 2014, and state officials did not inform the public of the outbreak until last month. \n \n The Legionnaires’ cases started popping up as Flint residents were complaining about the foul-smelling, discolored water flowing into their homes after the city switched to a new water source, the Flint River, in April 2014. Soon they were reporting rashes and stomach ailments, and whistle-blowers eventually pointed to alarming levels of lead in the water supply and in children’s blood.', 'Buy Photo Genesee County health official Jim Henry was among those calling for the Flint system to be tested as a Legionella source. He said the county lacked the expertise to do so. (Photo: Karen Bouffard / The Detroit News)Buy Photo \n \n Flint — Sixteen months after it was identified as a likely source of a deadly Legionnaires’ outbreak, Flint’s water supply still hasn’t been tested for the Legionella bacteria. \n \n None of five government agencies aware of the outbreak in Genesee County investigated the water system for Legionella despite concerns raised by the county’s Health Department over the water as early as October 2014. That was six months after the city left Detroit’s system and began drawing its water from the Flint River. \n \n Experts say the lack of a water evaluation made it impossible to know if the city’s new water source contributed to the respiratory disease outbreak that sickened 87 people between May 2014 and November 2015, killing nine. And to date, no source for the bacteria has been determined. \n \n In March 2015, the state Department of Environmental Quality considered taking samples from Flint’s water system to be tested for Legionella at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ laboratory. But neither agency followed through. \n \n That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency also suggested city water should be tested for Legionella during an EPA meeting about the outbreak and expressed that opinion to the DEQ in an email reviewed by The Detroit News. Again, no testing was done. \n \n Experts, including Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech professor whose research uncovered the problem of lead contamination in Flint water, argue the municipal water should have been tested for Legionella because the outbreak could be tied to changes in the water system. Genesee County Environmental Health Supervisor Jim Henry also called for such testing. Experts say had the source of the Legionella been confirmed as the water system, targeted chlorine treatments could have been applied to kill the bacteria. \n \n “MDEQ should have done such testing, especially after they were alerted to Legionella problems by the Genesee County Health Department,” Edwards said. “Better yet, they should have allowed CDC to come in and do that testing for them.” \n \n Besides the state’s DEQ and health department, the federal EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also confirm to The News they’ve done no water testing for Legionella in Flint. The Genesee County Health Department says it does not have the expertise to do so. \n \n The reasons why Flint’s water supply wasn’t tested aren’t entirely clear, although the local, state and federal agencies now largely blame each other or claim that typical procedures don’t involve testing municipal water supplies. \n \n State epidemiologist Shannon Johnson, in an October 2014 email to colleagues, wrote “the current hypothesis” was that “the source of the outbreak may be the Flint municipal water.” Johnson noted that county epidemiological mapping revealed most Legionnaires’ cases had occurred downstream of Flint’s municipal water plant, where chlorine and other bacteria-killing chemicals would be more diluted. \n \n “I let (the county health department) know that we could assist with and facilitate environmental testing, whether it be through our lab or DEQ,” Johnson wrote. \n \n Darren Lytle, acting chief of the Treatment Technology Evaluation Branch at the EPA in Cincinnati, also expressed concern that changes in Flint’s water system could be behind the outbreak during a meeting with federal colleagues on March 26, 2015, according to the meeting summary sent to the DEQ. \n \n “Maybe this isn’t happening in people’s homes, but it is happening in the distribution system pipes,” Lytle suggested to fellow EPA staffers. “First we must find the source — is Legionella there? If Legionella is present, in the tanks/pipes then disturbance of changing the water quality and flushing could cause it to proliferate.” \n \n At the same meeting, the EPA’s Miguel Del Toral added that extensive flushing then being done to address bacterial growth in stagnant water in parts of the system could also foster Legionella growth, according to meeting notes. \n \n Lytle offered to take municipal water samples and test them for Legionella. He noted the EPA had tested for Legionella at two Ohio hospitals as part of a research study, so a lab was already set up for Legionella testing. \n \n But the EPA never “received a request for assistance from the state, city or county” to get further involved, EPA spokeswoman Monica Lee told The News. \n \n Asked why the DEQ didn’t test then for Legionella in Flint, spokeswoman Mel Brown said the state health department was “the lead agency to look into the matter.” \n \n State had tests from patients \n \n In materials sent in conjunction with Gov. Rick Snyder’s Jan. 13 press conference announcing the outbreak, Michigan health officials said it was impossible to know if the cases were connected to Flint city water because of a “lack of clinical isolates” — samples of Legionella collected from patients. \n \n “There’s investigations still going on to try and make that determination,” Snyder said at that time when asked if the outbreak was linked to changes in Flint’s water system. “But from a scientific or medical point of view, I don’t believe that determination can be made today.” \n \n The state laboratory, in fact, had 12 clinical isolates from Legionnaires’ patients in Flint, the state health department confirmed. Of those isolates, molecular typing was completed on the eight that tested positive for Legionella. \n \n Investigators could then search for a DNA match in the environment. But since water samples were never were tested, there was nothing to compare the clinical isolates with. \n \n State health officials point to CDC guidelines as their reason for not sampling or testing Flint’s water system, or any other environmental source, for that matter. Health department spokeswoman Jennifer Eisner noted the CDC advises against testing the municipal water system, focusing instead on testing buildings that epidemiological studies indicate are associated with the outbreak. \n \n CDC spokesman Kristen Nordlund confirmed it “does not recommend routine testing of municipal water” for Legionella. \n \n “Because Legionella can grow to high levels and are spread to people by water systems inside buildings, we need building owners and managers in Michigan and elsewhere to ensure that they have programs in place that will prevent growth and spread,” Nordlund added. \n \n Michigan’s investigation was limited to results of epidemiological surveys of patients infected in each of two waves of the outbreak, the first from June 2014 through March 2015, and the second from May 2015 through November 2015. \n \n Based on results of the first study, state health officials concluded that Flint’s McLaren Medical Center was most strongly “associated” with the outbreak. Health officials wouldn’t name hospitals studied in the second survey. McLaren hired University of Pittsburgh microbiologist Janet Stout, one of the nation’s top experts in Legionnaires’ disease, to assess the situation at the hospital. She recommended remediation. \n \n Among the 12 Legionnaires isolates at the state laboratory, two were from McLaren, including one that tested positive for Legionella. Among a total of eight isolates that tested positive for the pathogen, one genetic match was found, between the McLaren isolate and one from Flint’s Hurley Medical Center. The other six did not match, indicating these were all different strains of Legionella bacteria. \n \n Results from the isolates suggested a need for testing throughout the water system, according to Amy Pruden, part of a team of Virginia Tech researchers studying water problems in Flint. \n \n “If they demonstrated that there were multiple strains infecting patients, then the bacteria likely originated from trace background levels at many locations in the distribution system or in building plumbing, where the water chemistry shift may have stimulated them to start growing,” Pruden said. \n \n “Given that Legionnaires’ is now the leading cause of illness spread by tap water, there is a need to be more responsive to outbreaks and better track the sources and causes of infection.” \n \n No fed help sought until ’16 \n \n According to Nordlund, the CDC was approached by Genesee County’s health department in February 2015 and the CDC “felt that a comprehensive investigation was warranted and offered to further assist Michigan by providing epidemiologic and laboratory support from Atlanta or in Michigan.” \n \n But the state health department “felt that they had the skills and resources needed to perform the investigation themselves,” Nordlund said. \n \n The state health department instead declared that the outbreak ended in March 2015, a finding released in June 2015, when more Legionnaires’ patients were being seen in area hospitals. \n \n It wasn’t until last month that the state health department asked the CDC for on-the-ground assistance in Flint, when the outbreak was made public by Snyder — 20 months after it started. The CDC is focusing its investigation at the building level, rather than investigating the municipal water system. \n \n “We felt we had enough capacity between our department and the Genesee County Health Department to conduct an investigation,” health department spokeswoman Angela Minicuci said. “We have never said that this is not related to the water. We have never discounted that theory.” \n \n According to Eisner, the state health department also believed it was up to the Genesee County Health Department to test the water for Legionella, if the county wanted it tested. \n \n The Genesee County Health Department feared the Legionella outbreak could be linked to changes in the municipal water system and alerted the state by October 2014. According to Henry, the county’s environmental health supervisor, county personnel didn’t have the expertise to test a municipal water system for Legionella, so they asked the state DEQ to investigate. \n \n Then-DEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel scorned Henry’s suspicion of city water in a March 13, 2015, email to Harvey Hollins, director the state Office of Urban and Metropolitan Initiatives, and a top Snyder aide. Hollins has since been tapped to lead the state’s response in Flint. The memo was copied to then DEQ Director Dan Wyant. \n \n “This is beyond irresponsible, given that this is his department that has failed to do the necessary traceback work to provide any conclusive evidence of where the outbreak is sourced,” Wurfel fumed. \n \n “ ... Legionnaires is NOT among the 90 water contaminants screened in the Safe Drinking Water Act, but in the absence of action by county health, our staff are now considering taking samples from various points in the system and working with (the health department’s) lab to test for it, if for no other reason than to rule it out.” \n \n According to Henry, the Genesee County Health Department was learning about the municipal water system on the fly. \n \n Henry said the state has primacy over municipal water systems. Counties oversee Type 2 wells, serving more than 25 people, and private wells. Operators of Type 2 wells handle their own water testing. \n \n “We typically don’t get involved with municipal water,” Henry said. “The water plant processes is something that we don’t know, I’ve only been learning about it because of this.” \n \n County health officials didn’t have a map of the water system, and couldn’t get one from Flint’s Department of Public Works. Department of Public Works did not return numerous emails and calls from The News. \n \n Initially, according to Henry, the city water department talked about testing for Legionella. To his knowledge, they didn’t follow through. \n \n “It was the distribution system, the water main breaks, the brown water events, these are all red flags,” Henry said. “These were all indications that something is seriously going wrong — the boil water advisories, we have an uptick in Legionnaires’ disease — that was enough to look into (the water system) so we can prevent another case.” \n \n kbouffard@detroitnews.com \n \n Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1XLGHam']",2,"– The water in Flint, Michigan, still hasn't been tested for the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease despite being the likely source of an outbreak that killed nine people and sickened another 78 between May 2014 and November 2015, the Detroit News reports.

"['The Oregon bakery owners who ignited a national controversy by refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple on Monday quietly paid a state-ordered $135,000 damages award and then some. \n \n Aaron Klein, co-owner of the shuttered Sweet Cakes by Melissa, walked into the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries\' Portland office and handed over a check for $136,927.07, an amount including accrued interest, agency spokesman Charlie Burr said. \n \n Earlier this month, the labor bureau recovered nearly $7,000 additional funds from the Kleins with the help of the state Department of Justice and a private collections agency, Burr said. The money came from a garnished bank account, he said. \n \n Aaron and Melissa Klein had refused to pay damages of $135,000 to Rachel and Laurel Bowman-Cryer, claiming financial hardship despite three online fundraising accounts set up by supporters that netted them at least $515,000 as of late September. Their reversal of course was first reported by Willamette Week. \n \n On July 2, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian ordered the Kleins to pay damages for emotional and mental suffering, saying they had violated the women\'s civil rights by discriminating on the basis of their sexual orientation. \n \n Rachel Bowman-Cryer visited the Gresham bakery with her mother in January 2013 to order a cake for a civil commitment ceremony. Aaron Klein, working alone that day, turned her away, citing his Christian beliefs against same-sex marriage. \n \n The women filed complaints with the state, triggering a national debate over the Kleins\' claims of religious freedom in the face of anti-discrimination laws that require Oregon businesses to serve the public equally. \n \n Tyler Smith, a Canby attorney representing the Kleins, said payment of the debt does not mean his clients have abandoned their appeal of Avakian\'s order. The Oregon Court of Appeals is likely to hear arguments next year but Smith said it made sense to pay now while the case is pending rather than incur additional interest charges. \n \n The bureau ""was attempting to charge interest rates of 9 percent, equating to $35 a day, and seeking to garnish any assets of the Kleins so they couldn\'t earn interest on the money that had been donated to them,"" Smith said. ""The prudent thing to do, given the generosity of people who have contributed funds, was to take care of it and continue the fight."" \n \n Through their lawyers, the Kleins twice asked Avakian for a stay to delay enforcement of his order while the Court of Appeals considers their case. The commissioner rejected the requests on July 14 and again July 24, citing the amounts raised for the Kleins from crowdfunding sites. State officials subsequently went to court to establish their right to place a property lien or other assets belonging to the couple. \n \n ""We certainly wish (the bureau) would have stayed collections efforts during the course of the appeal,"" Smith said. \n \n Altogether, the state has received roughly $144,000 from the Kleins - an amount that Burr acknowledged might be in excess of what was owed as of Monday, Dec. 28. \n \n ""We have been in touch with their lawyers throughout the process,"" Burr said, providing them with exact amounts due to satisfy the debt. The figure has changed from day to day because of accruing interest. \n \n If the Kleins have overpaid, the agency will look at returning the difference, Burr said. The Kleins closed their Gresham bakery in 2013 and now operate out of their home in Sandy. \n \n Paul Thompson, a Portland lawyer representing the Bowman-Cryers, said, ""My clients are happy the Kleins paid the fine and are moving forward, and hope to see the ruling upheld on appeal."" \n \n -- George Rede \n \n grede@oregonian.com \n \n 503-294-4004 \n \n @georgerede', 'PORTLAND, Ore.

"['Below most volcanoes, Earth packs some serious deep heat. Mount St. Helens is a standout exception, suggests a new study. Cold rock lurks under this active Washington volcano. \n \n Using data from a seismic survey (that included setting off 23 explosions around the volcano), Steven Hansen, a geophysicist at the University of New Mexico, peeked 40 kilometers under Mount St. Helens. That’s where the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate releases fluids due to intense heat and pressure as it descends beneath the North American plate. Those fluids rise and trigger melting in the rock above, fueling an arc of volcanoes that line up like lights on a runway. All except for Mount St. Helens, which stands apart about 50 kilometers to the west. Still, Hansen and colleagues expected to see a heat source under Mount St. Helens, as seen at other volcanoes. \n \n Instead, thermal modeling revealed a wedge of a rock called serpentinite that’s', 'Picture a volcanic eruption: fiery lava and smoke billowing skyward as a towering mountain empties its over-pressurized belly of a hot meal. At least, that’s how most of us think it works. So you can imagine volcanologists’ surprise when they discovered that Mount St. Helens, which was responsible for the deadliest eruption in US history, is actually cold inside. \n \n Apparently, it’s stealing its fire from somewhere else. \n \n \n \n Mount St. Helens is one of the most active volcanoes of the Cascade Arc, a string of eruptive mountains that runs parallel to the Cascadia subduction zone from northern California to British Columbia. It’s also one of the strangest. Most major volcanoes of the Cascade Arc sit neatly along a north-south line, where the wedging of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate beneath the North American plate forces hot mantle material to rise. Mount St. Helens, however, lies to the west, in a geologically quiescent region called the forearc wedge. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “We don’t have a good explanation for why that’s the case,” said Steve Hansen, a geoscientist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \n \n Seeking answers, Hansen recently led a seismic mapping survey of Mount St. Helens. In the summer of 2014, his team deployed thousands of sensors to measure motion in the ground around the volcano. Then, they drilled nearly two dozen holes, packed the holes full of explosives, triggered a handful of minor quakes, and watched as seismic waves bounced around beneath the mountain. “We’re looking at what seismic energy propagates off in the subsurface,” Hansen explained. “It’s a bit like a CAT scan.” \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n Their analysis, which is published today in Nature Communications, appears to have created more questions than it answered. From seismic reflections, Hansen and his colleagues learned that the types of minerals present at the boundary between Earth’s crust and mantle are markedly different to the east and west of Mount St. Helens, confirming that this area is geologically special. But instead of finding a hot mantle directly beneath the volcano, seismic data indicates a relatively cool wedge of serpentine rock. \n \n Not only is Mount St. Helens out of place, but it also lacks the magma reserves we’d expect given its violent history. So, where on Earth is Mount St. Helens getting its fuel? \n \n Hansen suspects the volcano’s magma source lies to the east, closer to the rest of the Cascade Arc, where material in the upper mantle is hotter. But that still leaves the question of why gooey rock being forced westward, through the crust or upper mantle, to erupt in this one off-kilter location. Earthquakes in the deep crust may be partially responsible, but more data is needed to confirm such a link. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Fortunately, more data is exactly what Hansen, and other scientists associated with the Imaging Magma Under St Helens (iMUSH) project, are now collecting. What geologists learn about this weird volcano—how its magmas form, how they move around, when and why they erupt—could improve our understanding of volcanic arc systems around the world. \n \n “Mount St. Helens is pretty unusual,” Hansen said. “It’s telling us something about how the arc system is behaving, and we don’t yet know what that something is.” \n \n \n \n [Nature Communications]', 'Several previous active and passive-source seismic studies have observed weak or absent Moho arrivals at other locations within the Cascadia forearc region14,16,18 (Fig. 1), including a reversal of the Moho velocity contrast in central Oregon13. The inferred reduction of mantle velocities has been attributed to the formation of low-velocity serpentine in the mantle wedge11,12,13,14. Serpentinite also has a relatively low-density and high-magnetic susceptibility, which is consistent with regional magnetic and gravity anomalies15. The presence of ∼50–75% serpentine is enough to reduce upper mantle P-wave velocities to 7.1–7.5 km s−1 (ref. 12), similar to the observed lower crustal velocities beneath Mount St Helens9,17. However, we note that this is only a rough estimate of the amount of serpentine required to extinguish the Moho discontinuity and is on high end of reported estimates for Cascadia which range 15–60% (refs 13, 19). \n \n The high pressure serpentine phase (antigorite) is stable in the mantle wedge at relatively low temperatures (<∼700 °C (ref. 20)) and can form by hydrous alteration of peridotite11,12. From a global perspective, Cascadia is a relatively warm arc due to the young age of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate21. However, modelling suggests that the down-going slab dewaters primarily beneath the forearc region in warm subduction zones22 and these fluids may therefore contribute to the serpentinization of the forearc mantle wedge12. Thermal modelling of the Cascadia subduction system21 (Fig. 6) suggests that the eastern limit of the antigorite stability field could extend to near Mount St Helens, therefore, we interpret the lack of PmP arrivals west of Mount St Helens as evidence for a serpentinized upper mantle. The observed transition in Moho reflectivity is abrupt, occurring over a distance of about 5–10 km and is consistent with imaging the antigorite dehydration front whose rapid reaction kinetics23 should produce a thermally well-defined boundary. \n \n Figure 6: Two dimensional thermal model of the Cascadia subduction system in Central Oregon and geologic interpretation. The surface locations of Mount St Helens and Mount Adams relative to the thermal model21 are determined by using their distance from the subduction trench. The top of the subducting plate and the crust-mantle boundary of the overriding plate are plotted as white lines. The hachured area denotes the region of the mantle wedge where serpentine is stable (<∼700 °C (ref. 20)). Locations of deep long period (DLP) earthquakes are plotted as white dots whose size scales with magnitude. The low velocity anomaly observed in the lower crust from iMUSH tomography9 is shown. Arrows show two possible pathways for the lateral migration of melt towards Mount St Helens; These include a path through the mantle wedge (B) and one through the mid-crust (A). Full size image \n \n Areas where serpentinite has been inferred in the Cascadia forearc mantle are typically offset from the main axis of arc volcanism by ∼50 km trenchward and are not usually associated with significant volcanism (Fig. 1). This observation is consistent with the view that the location of the volcanic arc relative to the trench is predominately controlled by the thermal structure of the mantle wedge6,8. Mount St Helens therefore presents a thermal paradox because it lies directly adjacent to the cold mantle wedge and yet still produces arc derived magmatism which requires elevated temperatures. For example, Mount St Helens primarily erupts dacites that are produced in the lower crust by either partial melting of a mafic source24 and/or partial crystallization of mantle derived basalts25. Analysis of melt inclusions from the 1980 and 2008 eruption cycles indicate that magma temperatures were 860–900 °C (ref. 26), consistent with thermal models of arc lower crust (800–1,000 °C)5. Additionally, analysis of young (post-Miocene) mantle derived basalts from southern Washington suggest melt segregation temperatures that range ∼1,200–1,450 °C (ref. 27). A hot mantle wedge directly beneath Mount St Helens is incongruent with the presence of a cold (<∼700 °C (ref. 20)) serpentinized uppermost mantle just west of the volcano (Fig. 6). \n \n One way this dilemma can be resolved is if the lower crustal source region resides east of the volcano, towards the hotter axial region of the volcanic arc, and the ascending melts migrate laterally in the crust towards the forearc region. Magnetotelluric results indicate that Mount St Helens is electrically connected to a region of high conductivity in the mid-crust28, which is located near the southern terminus of the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor29 (Fig. 1). This feature extends east to Mount Adams and has been interpreted as a layer of partial melt28, which could thus provide a pathway for the westward migration of melts derived from the lower crust towards the cold forearc (see path A in Fig. 6). However, dacites erupted at Mount St Helens have notably different geochemistry than those found at Mount Adams which suggests that the melt source regions for these two volcanos are not the same30. \n \n Alternatively, recent iMUSH active-source tomography resolves a vertical column of low seismic velocities southeast of the volcano that extends from Moho to mid-crust depths and is interpreted as partial melt9. This feature could therefore represent a localized lower crustal source region for the volcanism at Mount St Helens. The mantle derived basalts that ultimately drive the magmatic system25,31 require a hot source region (>∼1,200 °C (ref. 27)) suggesting that these melts are formed further to the east and migrate west into the cold forearc mantle wedge (path B in Fig. 6). The true thermal state of the mantle wedge beneath Mount St Helens is undoubtedly complicated by effects not accounted for in the two-dimensional (2D) model (Fig. 6), such as three-dimensional (3D) topography of the slab surface32 (Fig. 1) and heat transfer caused by the migration of melts33. Future geophysical constraints from the iMUSH project and increasingly realistic 3D modelling efforts are required to better constrain the deep melt pathways beneath Mount St Helens. \n \n A cluster of deep long period (DLP) earthquakes has been identified just southeast of Mount St Helens in the lower crust (23–44 km depth, Fig. 6). DLP events are commonly observed in volcanically active regions, including beneath many of the volcanoes in the Cascade Range34, and these events are thought to be caused by the movement or cooling of magmatic fluids35,36. The DLP at Mount St Helens are located near the edge of the low velocity column observed in the iMUSH tomography (Fig. 6) and have been interpreted as the result of magma injection9. Our PmP results suggest the DLP earthquake cluster is located above the antigorite stability boundary in the mantle wedge (Fig. 5) and therefore these features may be related. Buoyant ascent of water produced by serpentine dehydration has been suggested to explain non-volcanic DLP events observed in the forearc region of Central Oregon37. A local heat source is required to drive dehydration37 and this could be caused by the advection of heat associated with the arrival of mantle melts near the Moho beneath Mount St Helens (path B, Fig. 6).']",3,"– Mount St. Helens already stands out as one of the most active volcanoes in the Cascade Arc and the deadliest in the US, since its 1980 eruption claimed nearly 60 lives. It's also an outlier in a literal sense, sitting 30 miles west of the volcanoes that neatly line the Cascade Arc from north to south. Now scientists are reporting in the journal Nature Communications that they've discovered another oddity: The volcano appears to be perched atop what Gizmodo calls ""a cool wedge of serpentine rock""—dramatically unlike the fiery cauldrons of hot magma beneath other volcanoes. ""We don’t have a good explanation for why that’s the case,"" Steve Hansen, a geoscientist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, tells Gizmodo. His team drilled a couple dozen holes, filled them with explosives, and triggered minor earthquakes to watch seismic wave activity beneath Mount St. Helens, ""a bit like a CAT scan,"" Hansen says. But their findings leave them with more questions, namely: What's the volcano's heat source, if it's not right below the volcano itself? Hansen surmises that it's coming from further east, but until his team does more research, it's what Science News is calling ""a cold case."" (Earlier this year, there were dozens of small quakes on the mountain every week.)"
"['U.S. military personnel prepare to transfer an injured on board USS Fitzgerald, off Izu Peninsula, Japan, after the Navy destroyer collided with a merchant ship, Saturday, June 17, 2017. The Japan... (Associated Press) \n \n YOKOSUKA, Japan (AP) — U.S. and Japanese vessels and aircraft were searching Saturday for seven American sailors who were missing after their Navy destroyer collided before dawn with a container ship four times its size off the coast of Japan. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald was back at its home port in Yokosuka Naval Base south of Tokyo by sunset Saturday, its crew lined up on deck. The Philippine-flagged container ship was berthed at Tokyo\'s Oi wharf, where officials began questioning crew members about the cause of the nighttime crash. \n \n After helping stabilize the USS Fitzgerald, the destroyer USS Dewey joined other American and Japanese vessels and aircraft in the search for the missing sailors. \n \n At least three other Navy sailors were injured in the collision. \n \n Family members were frantically seeking news, appealing via social media for calls from sailors aboard from the ship. \n \n The U.S. 7th Fleet said in a statement that the crash damaged two berthing spaces, a machinery room and the radio room. Most of the more than 200 sailors aboard would have been asleep in their berths at the time of the pre-dawn crash. \n \n Water was being pumped out of flooded areas and it was unclear how long it would take to get into the crushed mid-right side of the ship once it was at the pier in Yokosuka, the statement said. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald\'s captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was airlifted early Saturday to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka and was in stable condition with a head injury, the Navy said. Two other crew members suffered cuts and bruises and were evacuated. It was unclear how many others may have been hurt. \n \n The Navy said that the collision occurred 56 nautical miles (103 kilometers) southwest of Yokosuka, home to the 7th Fleet. \n \n ""Right now we are focused on two things: the safety of the ship and the well-being of the sailors,"" said Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. \n \n The Japanese coast guard said it received an emergency call from the container ship, the ACX Crystal, reporting the collision at around 2:20 a.m. (1720 GMT Friday). It was questioning crew members of the ACX Crystal, which is operated by the Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen K.K., and was treating the incident as a case of possible professional negligence, said Masayuki Obara, a regional coast guard official. \n \n The ACX Crystal weighs 29,060 tons and is 222 meters (730 feet) long, the coast guard said, much larger than the 8,315-ton Navy destroyer. The container ship\'s left bow was dented and scraped, but it did not appear to have sustained any major structural damage. \n \n Nippon Yusen said all of the ACX Crystal\'s 20-member Filipino crew members were safe. \n \n Conditions were clear at the time of the collision, though Yutaka Saito of the coast guard said the area is particularly busy with sea traffic. \n \n The names of the missing sailors were being withheld pending notification of their families. U.S. Navy personnel set up support and counseling services to help families as they sought updates on crew members. \n \n ""Just heard the sweetest voice and saw a wonderful face. He\'s okay. Thank you all for the prayers,"" Rita Schrimsher of Athens, Alabama, tweeted after speaking with her 23-year-old grandson, Jackson Schrimsher, via Facetime. \n \n ""It could have been worse, so we\'re grateful,"" she said by phone. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi and Elaine Kurtenbach in Tokyo and Cathy Bussewitz and Jennifer Kelleher in Honolulu contributed to this report.', 'Tokyo (CNN) Seven US sailors are missing and the commanding officer of a US destroyer is among the injured after the warship and a merchant ship collided off the coast of Japan, the US Navy said. \n \n The smaller guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald suffered severe damage to its starboard side. \n \n ""The collision affected Fitzgerald\'s forward starboard side above and below the water line, causing significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room,"" according to a statement from US 7th Fleet. \n \n The statement hinted that the missing sailors could be trapped in the damaged area of the destroyer. \n \n ""It remains uncertain how long it will take to gain access to the spaces once the ship is pier side ... to methodically continue the search for the missing,"" the statement said. \n \n The two ships collided around 1:30 a.m. local time Saturday in the Pacific Ocean, about 56 nautical miles southwest from the port of Yokosuka and 12 miles off the Izu Peninsula, the Japanese coast guard said. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald heads to Yokosuka, home base of the 7th Fleet, beside a US tugboat, off Shimoda, Japan on Saturday. \n \n The Fitzgerald had left the US naval base in Yokosuka, where it is based, earlier Friday for routine operations in the area, a US Naval Forces Japan spokesman said. \n \n The warship was towed back to Yokosuka, escorted by a Japanese coast guard ship, naval officials said. It arrived at port late Saturday, when divers began inspecting the damage. \n \n Earlier, the ship\'s commander, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was evacuated by a Japanese naval helicopter while US military copters evacuated two injured US sailors. All three are in stable condition at the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, said Cmdr. Ron Flanders, public affairs officer for US Naval Forces Japan. \n \n Five Japanese Maritime Self Defense force ships were leading the search for the missing US sailors at the site of the collision, joined by another US warship, the guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey, the 7th Fleet said. US and Japanese aircraft also were involved. \n \n No one hurt on merchant ship \n \n The merchant vessel involved is the ACX Crystal, a container ship flagged in the Philippines, officials said. It is chartered by Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and owned by Dainichi-Invest Corporation, NYK said. \n \n A photo from shipping company NYK shows damage from the collision. \n \n No one aboard the Crystal was hurt, and no oil spilled from the vessel, NYK said. \n \n NYK and the ship\'s owner are cooperating a Japan Coast Guard investigation into the collision, the shipping firm said. \n \n ""Our thoughts and deep concerns go out to all those directly affected,"" NYK said. \n \n The ship-tracking website marinetraffic.com shows the ship had left the Japanese port of Nagoya on Friday evening. It was expected to dock at a Tokyo Bay port around 4:30 p.m. local time, officials said after the wreck, adding that the container ship was operating under charter to a Japanese shipping company. \n \n Photos of the Crystal showed damage to its bow. \n \n Damage to the Philippine container ship ACX Crystal is seen after it collided with the USS Fitzgerald in the waters off Izu Peninsula, this photo released by Japan\'s coast guard shows. \n \n Shipping zone can be precarious \n \n The area where the wreck happened is known for heavy maritime traffic, the Japanese coast guard said. About 400 to 500 ships pass through the zone each day, the service said. \n \n The last known fatal incident there was in September 2015, when a South Korean vessel and a Japanese container ship collided, Japan\'s coast guard reported. Six Japanese crew were declared dead. \n \n The area has seen two other major collisions in the past five years. \n \n In such a busy shipping lane, the ships may have been in a ""restricted navigation"" situation, meaning they would have had o observe strict rules for movement and positioning in relation to other vessels in their vicinity, said Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\'s Joint Intelligence Center and a Hawaii Pacific University professor. \n \n Those rules leave vessels little room to maneuver, as turning away from one ship could place a vessel at risk of an even more serious incident with another, Schuster said. \n \n It completed $21 million in upgrades and repairs in February and is forward-deployed to Yokosuka, supporting security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, the service said. \n \n The 29,000-ton container ship, which handles general cargo, includes a captain and a crew of 20, NYK said. It was built in 2008 and is about 730 feet long. \n \n The larger size of the container ship could have left the smaller US destroyer vulnerable in the collision, Schuster said. \n \n An injured USS Fitzgerald crew member is carried by US military personnel, left, and Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force members upon arriving Saturday to the US Naval Base in Yokosuka Japan. \n \n The force of the impact could have thrown overboard sailors who were standing on the opposite side of the destroyer from where it was struck, he said. That could account for the missing sailors, who may have been on deck on watch or even just relaxing in the night air, he said. \n \n Sailors also could have been trapped in compartments below deck, Schuster said, pointing out that container ships have a bulbous bow below the water line, which may have plowed into the US warship. \n \n Experienced commander in charge \n \n Benson, the Fitzgerald\'s commander, was new to the position, having taken command of the vessel May 13 after serving as the ship\'s executive officer, or second in command, since November 2015, the Navy said last month. \n \n Cmdr. Bryce Benson \n \n The Fitzgerald is the second command for Benson, a 1999 Naval ROTC graduate of Marquette University. He commanded the minesweeper USS Guardian, operating out of Sasebo, Japan, from 2008 to 2010, before taking shore assignments in Washington and with US Pacific Command. \n \n The collision was the second in the region for US Navy warship in just more than a month. On May 9, the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain was struck by a South Korean fishing boat off the Korean Peninsula. \n \n No injuries were reported in that incident, which a Navy official said occurred when the fishing boat\'s crew did not have a radio to hear warnings from the US warship. \n \n The guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam ran aground in late January while anchoring near Yokosuka, damaging its propellers and discharging 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil into the bay. \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the status of the commanding officer. He was transported by medevac for treatment.']",2,"– US and Japanese vessels and aircraft are searching for seven American sailors who are missing after their Navy destroyer collided before dawn with a container ship four times its size off the coast of Japan.

"['“OMG New Moon Has $140 Million Opening!” said a UK magazine. “OMG times one million, you guys,” writes a reporter in The Detroit News. Even the New York Times’ Manohla Dargis described “New Moon” as “the juiceless, near bloodless sequel about a teenage girl and the sparkly vampire she, like, totally loves.” \n \n Anyone noticing a pattern here? \n \n In writing about the box office juggernaut — a film that is smashing records left and right, beating Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings in online advance sales, among other “firsts” — headline writers are using the language of teen girls. \n \n Cute? I don’t think so. There’s something that stinks to me here. Using this kind of language to cover such stunning box office success feels like an attempt to both mock girl culture and detract from the very butch success of this women and girl-driven phenomenon. \n \n I wonder if it makes people uncomfortable that, as the blogger Melissa Silverstein wrote, “A franchise fueled by girls and women has the potential of beating the machines for the box office record. This movie could potentially be ‘guy proof’ meaning they won’t need guys to see it for it to kick some box office butt. Whereas the other franchises NEED women to make their numbers.” \n \n After all, the headlines we’re used to are that women can’t get real parts in Hollywood, and that women don’t support female-centered movies. And as we saw in a recent New York Times profile of Kristen Stewart, the Twilight Saga allows her to pursue a dark, authentic role for a young woman – albeit a disturbing one — opportnities that are clearly in short supply for young women even a few years older, like Megan Fox (profiled by the New York times on the same day in part about her struggle to be taken seriously). \n \n “The question is,” writes Kate Harding at Salon Broadsheet, “will the powers that be recognize young women as a robust market that’s been largely ignored and condescended to, or will they write it off as a limited phenomenon?” If you know me, you know that I love the language of teen girls…so much so that I haven’t quite grown out of it myself. And I write this less as an expression of outrage than an observation. All I’m saying is that I’m pretty sure the words to describe what’s happening this week at box offices around the world aren’t “OMG” and “like, totally.” They’re “millions,” “record-breaking” and “87 percent of advance ticket holders are female.”', 'TOP STORIES | WEB EXCLUSIVE New Moon, Same Old Sexist Story \n \n By Carmen D. Siering and Katherine Spillar Sure, the film New Moon is breaking box office records, and both tween girls and their moms are swooning over pale-faced vampire Edward and hunky werewolf Jacob, who both vie for the attention of our ostensible hero, Bella. Isn’t it romantic? Well…. with just a moment of critical analysis, feminists can’t be too happy about how the latest episode in the Twilight series, adapted from Stephanie Meyer’s popular books, represents a young woman and her place in the modern world. In fact, the New film is really just more of the same, only worse. Where director Catherine Hardwicke, who helmed the first Twilight film, subtly tweaked the characters of Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson), creating a somewhat more equal relationship between them, New Moon director Chris Weitz seems content to let things stand as Meyer wrote them. Edward reverts to his overbearing ways, dictating the direction of the relationship—in this case, ending it—and Bella quite literally lies down and takes it. In fact, just moments after Edward leaves her, Bella stumbles in the woods and refuses to get up, lying in the muck until a strong, bare-chested man carries her out. Later, we see her sitting in her room, staring out the window, as the months roll by. When she isn’t sitting and staring, she is in bed having nightmares. Very empowering. What finally rouses her is a vision of Edward—which she sees after she hops on a motorcycle with a creepy guy. Even this ghostly Edward is bossy, scolding Bella to be careful, but it seems Bella likes, or needs, to be bossed around. Bella figures out that she needs to do “dangerous things” to keep seeing her visions of Edward. She somehow rustles up a couple of motorcycles and convinces her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) to get them running. What follows is the requisite time-passing montage of the two of them fixing the bikes and, Jacob hopes, Bella’s broken heart. \n \n \n \n Like the previous film, New Moon wraps its romantic sensuality in a tidy abstinence message, but this time Bella denies her physical attraction and growing fondness for Jacob in order to remain true to Edward, never mind that he dumped her. One can’t help but feel sorry for Jacob. The guy is crazy about Bella, and she tells him he is her “best friend.” The truth is, Bella is obviously attracted to Jacob, and spends much of the film physically close to him. The two hug, cuddle, and come close to kissing too many times to count—but she always pushes him away at the last minute. To hear her insist this is a platonic friendship rings untrue, yet ultimately Bella is pretty callous regarding Jacob’s feelings, telling him not to make her choose between Edward and himself because Edward will always win. Bella doesn’t come across as an empowered young woman in New Moon, especially as she uses one man to get over another. And yet, as Ms. pointed out in our Spring 2009 article “Taking a Bite Out of Twilight,” Meyer has insisted that she sees Bella as a feminist character, writing on her website that in her opinion the foundation of feminism is being able to choose. But what Meyer fails to acknowledge is that all the choices Bella makes are the one’s Meyer would make—choices based perhaps on her background as a member of the highly patriarchal Mormon church. This is a film full of gender stereotypes—testosterone-driven male aggression, females who pine away over lost loves, boys who fix motorcycles and the girls who watch them. The one role-reversal in New Moon, where Bella saves Edward for a change, is immediately negated when Bella’s low self-esteem takes center stage. Even as Edward declares his love to her, Bella deems herself “unworthy” of it, being simply human while he’s a vampire and all. Perpetuating the idea that this is true love—torturous, painful, and unrequited—is detrimental to all of us, women and men. There’s something scary about New Moon, but it’s in the human encounters, not those with the monsters. One wishes Weitz had taken a page from Hardwicke’s script instead of simply following Meyer’s so completely. Next up: Eclipse, due to hit theaters June 30, 2010. If there really isn’t anything new under the moon-blocked sun, we’ll expect even more of the same, and another missed opportunity to create a Bella who stands more on her own.

Vampire love interest Edward is “overbearing,” and heroine Bella “quite literally lies down and takes it,” write Carmen D. Siering and Katherine Spillar in Ms. “This is a film full of gender stereotypes—testosterone-driven male aggression, females who pine away over lost loves, boys who fix motorcycles, and the girls who watch them.” And the media attention paid to the film isn’t much better, writes Rachel Simmons on her website. Headlines like “OMG New Moon Has $140 Million Opening!” use teen-girl-speak to talk about the film’s success, but Simmons doesn’t find it cute. It “feels like an attempt to both mock girl culture and detract from the very butch success of this women and girl-driven phenomenon,” signaling that Hollywood may be intimidated by a “guy-proof” film franchise."
"['Most of the outstanding ballots are coming from Arizona\'s largest county, Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix and includes Kyrsten Sinema\'s congressional district. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images Elections Sinema takes slim lead in too-close-to-call Arizona Senate race \n \n Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema took a narrow 9,610-vote lead over GOP Rep. Martha McSally Thursday evening as Arizona’s election authorities counted more ballots in the state’s uncalled Senate race. \n \n The lead amounts to less than half a percentage point with more than 1.8 million votes counted. McSally was up by 17,703 votes earlier in the day, before the counties processed another 160,000 votes — but about a half-million more votes remain to be counted across Arizona, according to both campaigns. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Most of the outstanding ballots are coming from Arizona\'s largest county, Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix and includes Sinema\'s congressional district. Sinema held a slight edge of about 1 point over McSally in the county as of Thursday afternoon, but the new votes counted Thursday expanded the Democrat’s Maricopa edge to 2.5 points. That’s the outcome Democrats had hoped for, while Republicans were expecting McSally’s tally there to improve. \n \n The state will continue to count early votes cast before the election daily until the race is resolved. \n \n “Arizonans must have faith that their votes are counted, and we are working diligently to ensure that count proceeds in a fair, transparent, and timely manner that voters can trust,” Andrew Piatt, Sinema’s campaign manager, said in a statement Thursday afternoon.

In Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott is ahead of Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by two-tenths of a percentage point, but the race is headed for a recount. And in Mississippi, Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy will face off in a late November special-election runoff. \n \n Republicans have already secured 51 Senate seats to 46 for Democrats, after three Democratic incumbents and one GOP senator lost on Tuesday night. \n \n poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/3930/1155968404_5856543053001_5856538663001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true \n \n Hyde-Smith is expected to win the Mississippi runoff. But depending on the results in Arizona and Florida, the Republican majority in the next Senate could be as small as 52 seats or as big as 54. That spread could be significant on legislation and judicial confirmations over the next two years — as well as in the 2020 elections, when Republicans must defend 22 Senate seats compared to just 12 for Democrats. \n \n In Arizona, Sinema led comfortably in polling throughout the summer and fall, but McSally closed the gap by late October. The race was one of the most expensive in the country, with nearly $30 million spent by both parties. \n \n Sinema and McSally are vying to replace Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who retired after clashing with President Donald Trump. \n \n Both campaigns are digging in for a protracted coda to the election. McSally’s campaign sent out a fundraising request Thursday evening for donations to help fund an “army of attorneys and observers” to fend off any legal challenges once the votes are tallied. \n \n McSally’s campaign also tweeted that she was “dreading a long and painful process.” The tweet included a photo of her in a dentist’s chair.', 'CLOSE Hundreds of thousands of votes are still left to be counted.

Green Party candidate Angela Green had earned 43,838. \n \n It\'s too soon to know who will ultimately prevail. \n \n With tens of thousands of outstanding ballots, the campaign managers for both teams conveyed confidence, with each saying the remaining ballots would favor their candidate. \n \n After Sinema\'s lead widened Thursday, McSally\'s campaign manager, Jim Bognet, predicted Sinema\'s lead would ""disappear.""

The bed ate up most of the floor space, strewn with papers, charging cords and laptop computers. \n \n The early election results dropped at 8 p.m. that election night six years ago. She was ahead of Republican challenger Vernon Parker, just not as much as she had hoped to be in the race for Arizona\'s 9th Congressional District, a newly created seat evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. \n \n Sinema buzzed with nervous energy and settled in for a roller-coaster week. \n \n Her lead began to grow over the course of the few days, as the Maricopa County Recorder\'s counting of so-called late early ballots began to post, recalled her former campaign manager, Rodd McLeod. \n \n MORE: Here\'s why there are still so many votes left to count in Arizona \n \n As she awaited the final results, Sinema threw a party for the volunteers and staff who worked on her campaign and worked the phones, thanking donors and supporters. \n \n ""She understands there\'s a big job to do counting these ballots,"" McLeod said. ""You\'re still working, and you\'re observing the ballot count, but you\'re waiting.

(Associated Press) \n \n The statement, by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, appeared to be the most serious threat of reprisal by Moscow for Western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Ukraine\'s Crimea region. \n \n Russia is key to attempts to coax Iran into significant long-term curbs of its nuclear program in exchange for relief from U.N. and other sanctions. Iran insists it does not want nuclear arms but is seeking a deal that will result in full sanctions relief. \n \n The Russian threat, hours after the latest negotiating round ended, appeared to catch Washington off guard. \n \n Days ahead of the meeting, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki had said she expects Russia to ""remain an active partner"" in the talks. During the two-day talks, Western officials involved described Russia\'s participation as constructive and unchanged by the Ukraine tensions. \n \n Ryabkov was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying Russia may feel compelled to respond to U.S. and European Union actions. He said Russia considers ""reunification"" with Crimea more important than the developments surrounding Iran\'s nuclear program. \n \n ""We wouldn\'t like to use these talks as an element of the game of raising the stakes taking into account the sentiments in some European capitals, Brussels and Washington,"" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. ""But if they force us into that, we will take retaliatory measures here as well."" \n \n Russia and the U.S. often hold different positions about what Iran needs to do to banish fears about its nuclear activities. That includes uranium enrichment, which Iran says it needs to make reactor fuel — but which can also manufacture fissile warhead material. \n \n Ahead of the most recent talks, diplomats told The Associated Press that Moscow was ready to accept a more robust Iranian enrichment program than Washington. \n \n But American officials have always said that Russia and the United States are united in their goal of banishing the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, even if they differ on how to get there. \n \n Iran has often tried to exploit U.S.-Russian differences and Ryabkov\'s comments could embolden it to resist significant nuclear cutbacks. \n \n China usually supports Russia at the negotiations but the United States, Britain, France and Germany are unlikely to accept a lenient deal. \n \n At worst, the talks could fall apart. That could embolden Israel to make good on threats to attack Iran\'s nuclear facilities and draw the United States into any military confrontation. \n \n The Russian comments overshadowed signs that Iran may be ready to compromise. \n \n Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had suggested earlier Wednesday his country was ready eliminate fears that a reactor it is building at Arak could be used to make atomic arms. \n \n Zarif implied that Iran was open to re-engineering the facility to one that would produce less plutonium, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. Like enriched uranium, plutonium can be used to arm nuclear warheads. \n \n While Iran insists on completing and running its nuclear reactor, ""any proliferation concerns"" linked to it ""have to be removed,"" he was quoted as saying. \n \n ___ \n \n Ischachenkov reported from Moscow.

""And by that we mean consequences on relations in a broad range of economic areas."" \n \n U.S. and EU officials had already imposed sanctions on more than two dozen Russian and Crimean officials, and urged Russia to avoid escalating the crisis -- a call Moscow has ignored. \n \n But U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday announced more sanctions on individuals and one bank in response to Russia\'s annexation moves. \n \n He also signed a new executive order that authorizes possible further sanctions on what he called ""key sectors"" of the Russian economy if Moscow does not act to deescalate the situation. \n \n ""This is not our preferred outcome. These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy,"" he said. ""However Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community."" \n \n Russia must respect ""basic principles"" of sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said, adding that the United States should also provide financial support for Ukraine\'s government and people. \n \n ""We want the Ukrainian people to determine their own destiny and have good relations with the United States, Russia, Europe -- anyone they choose,"" he said, calling for continued diplomatic efforts. \n \n Sanctions lists \n \n The new U.S. sanctions target 20 officials, including senior Russians and ""cronies"" who hold significant influence in the Russian system, as well as one bank that holds ""significant"" resources, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. \n \n That bank was listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as Bank Rossiya. \n \n The individuals named by the Treasury include major Putin allies, both in the Kremlin and in business. Among the 16 government officials listed are Putin\'s chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov; the speaker of the State Duma, Sergey Naryshkin; and Viktor Ozerov, chairman of the Security and Defense Committee of the Russia parliament\'s upper house. \n \n Four others were named as members of the government\'s inner circle. They are financier Yuri Kovalchuk, labeled Putin\'s personal banker by a senior U.S. administration official; magnate Gennady Timchenko, whose activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin, according to the Treasury; and businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg. \n \n Besides Russia\'s Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin, The expanded EU sanctions target list includes two advisors to President Putin, Sergey Glazyev and Vladislav Surkov, as well as the chairwoman of the Russian Senate Valentina Matvienko. \n \n Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told CNN\'s Christiane Amanpour that the new round of U.S. sanctions would be ""significantly more powerful than the first one."" \n \n The latest round ""hits significant economic interests that are fairly close to the ruling circles in Moscow. It will be noticed,"" he said. \n \n Russia responded with sanctions against nine U.S. officials and lawmakers, including speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives John Boehner, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid and Sens. John McCain, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, according to a list published by the Russian Foreign Ministry. \n \n Boehner\'s spokesman, Michael Steel, said the lawmaker was ""proud to be included on a list of those willing to stand against Putin\'s aggression."" \n \n McCain responded, ""I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off, my Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea."" \n \n The U.S. Treasury said Bank Rossiya is controlled by Yuri Kovalchuk and is the 17th-largest bank in Russia. \n \n It has $10 billion in assets and handles the accounts of some top government officials, the Treasury said, adding that the bank has relationships with banks in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. The bank also provides services to the oil, gas and energy sectors, it said. \n \n ""As a result of Treasury\'s action, any assets of the persons designated today that are within U.S. jurisdiction must be frozen,"" the Treasury said. \n \n British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters at the EU Heads of State or Government summit there would likely be more asset freezes and travel bans. \n \n Finland\'s Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade Alexander Stubb told CNN more names would be added Thursday. \n \n ""There will probably be over 10 new names on the list and then of course people are going to argue, are these people good to be on the list, bad to be on the list are they to be taken seriously and so on, but there will be more names,"" Stubb said. \n \n Lavrov told lawmakers that sanctions ""have never brought any positive results"" and that there were no legal grounds for them. \n \n Kiev defiant \n \n Russia\'s defense minister assured U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in phone call Thursday that Russian troops on the Ukraine border do not intend to cross the border or take aggressive action, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. \n \n Hagel made it clear in the lengthy and sometimes ""direct"" talk with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu that the Russians bear responsibility for what happens in Crimea, including the recent violence, since they are in control there, Kirby said. \n \n While Russia insists its actions are legitimate, Ukraine\'s parliament said Thursday that Kiev will never stop fighting for Crimea, even if the country\'s new leaders have discussed evacuating military personnel from the region. \n \n Photos: Photos: Crisis in Ukraine Photos: Photos: Crisis in Ukraine Crisis in Ukraine – Ukrainian tanks are transported from their base in Perevalne, Crimea, on Wednesday, March 26.

Ukraine has facilities ready to accommodate 25,000 evacuees. \n \n A statement on the Ukrainian presidential website said former Presidents Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma had asked Turchynov to redeploy soldiers who are still in Crimea to the mainland. \n \n The call was ""to protect and save lives of Ukrainian servicemen who bear service in difficult and dangerous conditions in Crimea,"" the statement said. \n \n Porubiy had also said the measures included a full-scale visa system for Russians. \n \n Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Kiev was in no hurry to impose a visa regime on Russia, since it could negatively affect Ukrainians living in the predominantly Russian-speaking east of the country. \n \n Yatsenyuk is in Brussels to sign the political part of an association agreement with the European Union. \n \n Lavrov said the intention to introduce visa regulations was ""surprising and regrettable."" \n \n As diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continue, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon traveled to Russia Thursday, where he met Putin and Lavrov. He will then head to Kiev where he will meet acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov and Yatsenyuk on Friday. \n \n Russia\'s Interfax news agency quoted Ban as saying during a meeting with Putin that he was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation involving Ukraine and Russia. \n \n Navy chief released \n \n Ukraine\'s navy commander, detained when supporters of Russia took over the naval headquarters in Crimea, was released, the presidential website said Thursday. \n \n Amid signs the uneasy standoff between pro-Russian and Ukrainian forces could ignite into bloody conflict, about 300 armed men stormed the naval base in Sevastopol on Wednesday. They took away Ukrainian navy chief Sergey Gaiduk. \n \n Turchynov issued a 9 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) deadline for Crimea to release all hostages and stop all provocations. Kiev\'s new leaders had warned that if all hostages, including Gaiduk, were not released by then, authorities would take action of ""technical and technological character,"" probably meaning turning off utilities. \n \n A statement on the presidential site said Gaiduk and several other hostages had been freed. They were released during the night and were on their way to Kiev Thursday. \n \n Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu had asked authorities in Crimea to free Gaiduk and allow him safe passage out of the region. \n \n The incident at the navy headquarters came a day after one member of the Ukrainian military was killed when masked gunmen seized their base near the Crimean regional capital, Simferopol. \n \n JUST WATCHED Ukraine on edge of \'dangerous conflict\' Replay More Videos ...

Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters \n \n After an ultimatum to abandon the base and an hours-long standoff, Russian troops in at least four armored vehicles seized control of one of the last Ukrainian military outposts in Crimea. \n \n A day after Russia effectively absorbed Crimea, Russian-backed forces on Wednesday broke into the Ukrainian naval headquarters in the key Crimean city of Sevastopol and raised the Russian flag. \n \n A day after Russia effectively absorbed Crimea, Russian-backed forces on Wednesday broke into the Ukrainian naval headquarters in the key Crimean city of Sevastopol and raised the Russian flag. \n \n Responding to Russia’s latest moves to formalize its annexation of Crimea, President Obama on Thursday announced new sanctions against Moscow and authorized possible future penalties against “key sectors of the Russian economy.” \n \n Russia promptly retaliated by banning nine U.S. lawmakers and officials from entering the country. The list of banned Americans includes Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and three top Obama aides, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. McCain lamented sarcastically that his spring vacation in Siberia was now “off.” \n \n The announcements came after the lower house of the Russian parliament voted Thursday to admit Crimea and the metropolitan region of Sevastopol into the Russian Federation, putting some of the final procedural touches on Moscow’s controversial takeover of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. \n \n In Washington, Obama said he was ordering new sanctions against Russia in response to what he called Crimea’s “illegal” secession referendum and Russia’s “illegitimate move” to annex Crimea. \n \n “The United States is today moving . . . to impose additional costs on Russia,” Obama said before embarking on a trip to Florida. He said more top Russian officials will be subject to sanctions, as well as other individuals and a bank known for providing “material support” to the Russian leadership. \n \n President Obama said Thursday before leaving for Florida that the U.S. government would expand sanctions on Russian individuals and authorize future sanctions for sectors of the Russian economy. The president predicted these measures could have an effect on the global economy. (The Associated Press) \n \n Obama added that he “signed a new executive order today that gives us the authority to impose sanctions not just on individuals but on key sectors of the Russian economy.” He did not immediately elaborate on which sectors might be targeted, but he noted: “This is not our preferred outcome. These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy.” \n \n A fact sheet released by the Treasury Department listed 20 individuals and the Bank Rossiya as targets of the additional sanctions. Eleven people — including seven Russians — were named on a sanctions list issued earlier this week. \n \n The individuals and the bank are being punished in connection with the annexation of Crimea. The new executive order that Obama signed separately authorizes the Treasury, if Obama so decides in the future, to impose sanctions against additional Russian entities — which he described as constituting key sectors of the economy — in the event that Russia takes further action such as invading the rest of Ukraine. \n \n In Crimea, Ukrainian troops continued to face threats Thursday, as a group of armed men boarded a Ukrainian ship in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol. \n \n Vladislav Seleznyov, a Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman, said about 20 gunmen boarded the anti-submarine corvette Ternopol shortly after sunset Thursday and seized it, using flash grenades. There were no reported injuries. \n \n Among those on the new sanctions list are government and business leaders who have been close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, some for many years. They include some of the richest men in Russia, as well as one Russian who is in the oil-trade business in Switzerland. \n \n Connections to St. Petersburg, Putin’s home town, abound. The list targets several of the business leaders who have profited the most during Putin’s years in power through their connections to him. \n \n The list includes key officials such as Sergei Naryshkin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, and Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, as well as influential Russians in the banking and business communities. Among them is Yuri Kovalchuk, an old Putin friend from St. Petersburg who is known as “Putin’s banker.” \n \n Kovalchuk and another person on the list, Putin aide Andrei Fursenko, are owners of Bank Rossiya, the sanctioned bank. \n \n Bank Rossiya was described as having $10 billion in assets and as handling financial transactions for many senior Russian officials. \n \n Long-time Putin associates Arkady and Boris Rotenberg also were named. A senior U.S. official pointed out that the St. Petersburg-based brothers were close to the center of power, receiving $7 billion in contracts connected to the Sochi Olympics. \n \n The senior Obama administration official described the targets as “senior government officials, cronies and a crony bank.” \n \n Briefing reporters Thursday after Obama’s speech, the official took a stern tone. “We saw some bluster earlier in the week that sanctions would have no impact. I would suggest if they have any interest in doing business outside the U.S., they will have difficulty doing so.” \n \n The bank will be frozen out of the dollar, and correspondent accounts with U.S. banks will be terminated, the official said, adding that sanctioned individuals “will be prevented from operating around the world to the greatest extent possible.” \n \n The other Americans banned from entering Russia are Caroline Atkinson, deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs; presidential aides Daniel Pfeiffer and Benjamin Rhodes; Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Sen. Daniel Coats (R-Ind.). \n \n “We have warned repeatedly that using sanctions is a double-edged sword and will hit the United States back,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its Web site. \n \n “Washington has been repeatedly assured that it is unacceptable and counterproductive to talk with our country in such a way,” it said. “However, the U.S. seems to continue believing blindly in the efficiency of such methods, taken from the arsenal of the past, and does not want to admit the obvious — in complete accordance with international laws and the U.N. charter, Crimean residents voted democratically for rejoining Russia. This decision can be liked or not, but it concerns reality, which has to be taken into account.” \n \n The statement added: “There should be no doubts — we will respond adequately to every hostile attack.” \n \n Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Secretary of State John F. Kerry spoke again by phone Thursday about Ukraine, and Lavrov said the United States must stop “condoning” the activities of the right-wing Ukrainian group Right Sector and the Svoboda party, the ministry said in a separate statement. \n \n “Lavrov stressed that the decision on Crimea’s reunification with Russia reflected the expression of the will of the absolute majority of its people, that it may not be reviewed and must be respected,” the statement said. Lavrov, it said, complained about “ongoing violence” by “ultranationalist and extremist forces,” who he claimed were targeting businessmen, journalists, dissenters, Russian speakers and “our compatriots.” \n \n Responding to his inclusion in the ban, McCain said in a statement: “I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off, my Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea.” \n \n Menendez said in a statement: “President Putin’s military invasion and annexation of Crimea is brutal, totally unacceptable, and sadly returns us to a period of Cold War aggression and hostility. It doesn’t have to be this way, but if standing up for the Ukrainian people, their freedom, their hard earned democracy, and sovereignty means I’m sanctioned by Putin, so be it.” \n \n The vote in Russia’s lower house, the State Duma, to annex Crimea was 443 to 1. The measure needed 300 votes to pass. \n \n The lone Duma dissenter, Ilya Ponomaryov, later tweeted, “The best intentions have led us to a big political mistake: I vote against the war.” \n \n [Meet the one Russian lawmaker who voted against annexing Crimea.] \n \n The bill is scheduled to be taken up Friday by the upper house, the Federation Council, where expected approval will make Crimea officially part of the country under Russian law — despite the insistence of the United States, Europe and others that it remain part of Ukraine. \n \n In Crimea on Thursday, Ukraine’s influence over the disputed region seemed visibly on the wane, with military bases now under the Russian flag and Ukrainian banks closed for the time being. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said it was preparing a plan to withdraw its remaining troops and officials. \n \n Still, there were hints of a potentially durable conflict, as both Europe and the United States pledged further financial sanctions against Russia, and officials in Kiev and Moscow talked of trade, visa and other penalties they might impose against each other. \n \n Lavrov, testifying Thursday in favor of the bill in the Duma, warned Ukraine not to seize property located within its borders of the Russian state-owned energy giant, Gazprom. He said such a move would have negative consequences for Ukraine. \n \n “I think that it is in no one’s interests to begin this battle,” he said. “This could lead to a quite complex chain reaction, from which I suppose Ukraine will not benefit.” \n \n Lavrov said that he thought Ukraine’s threat to leave the Commonwealth of Independent States, a post-Soviet grouping, is essentially a “propaganda” ploy, but he added that Russia will do nothing to stop it if that’s what Ukraine wishes. \n \n However, Russia’s sanitary service almost simultaneously announced that Ukrainian livestock will be barred from Russia if the country leaves the CIS. \n \n The Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its Web site that it regrets Ukraine’s intention to require Russian visitors to obtain visas. \n \n United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon visited Putin in the Kremlin on Thursday and said he was deeply concerned about the Crimean crisis. \n \n “We highly appreciate your efforts,” Putin said, before they began private talks. \n \n European leaders on Thursday weighed additional sanctions against Russia, a day after Ukrainian troops were forced to abandon their bases in Crimea and prepared to evacuate the peninsula. \n \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her parliament that Europe would expand the number of individuals punished with travel bans and asset freezes for their role in the Russian takeover of Crimea. But as European Union leaders prepared to meet in Brussels, there was little sign they would impose the sort of broader financial penalties that many analysts see as necessary to change Russian behavior. \n \n U.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized their close consultation with Europe, and the announcement of initial sanctions early this week was coordinated with the allies. \n \n The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on 21 Russian and Ukrainian officials, and the United States announced sanctions the same day against 11 people — seven top Russian government officials and politicians and four Ukrainians, including ousted president Viktor Yanukovych and two Crimean separatist leaders. \n \n Speaking from Brussels, interim Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Thursday that he did not believe Russia would stop at Crimea. “It’s crystal clear for us that Russian authorities will try to move further and escalate the situation in southern and eastern Ukraine,” Yatsenyuk told Bloomberg News. \n \n In Crimea, meanwhile, the Ukrainian presence continued to ebb. Ukrainian banks were closed Thursday, with signs taped to the doors saying they no longer have authority to operate in Crimea because they are on foreign territory. They said they are making arrangements to reopen and that depositors will not lose their savings. \n \n Leonid Polyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense, said a plan has been prepared to evacuate military families from Crimea, but the troops themselves have not yet been given orders. \n \n Ukraine said Wednesday it would seek U.N. support in declaring Crimea a demilitarized zone so that its troops could be relocated to Ukraine proper, effectively acknowledging that it had lost the region despite vows it would never cede to Russia. \n \n In the announcement, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Andriy Parubiy, said his country would hold joint military exercises with the United States and Britain. He did not provide details, but a Pentagon spokesman in Washington said the annual multinational exercises were previously planned and will be held in the summer. \n \n Parubiy also said Ukraine would leave the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of 11 nations that were part of the Soviet Union before it broke up \n \n in 1991. It is led by Russia, and Ukraine’s departure echoes steps taken by Georgia after two of its territories broke away in 2008 with the support of Moscow. \n \n Russia’s storming of the Ukrainian military facilities in Crimea, and the positioning of forces outside another base, served as a tense reminder of how unresolved the situation remains in Crimea even as Russia declares its absorption of the region an established fact. Ukrainian troops largely gave way without resistance Wednesday, though tension may be building as they face an apparent choice of becoming Russian soldiers and sailors, or moving from Crimea and maintaining their allegiance to Kiev. \n \n Russia is also unlikely to agree to the terms of a demilitarized zone, which would require it to withdraw troops from the region while Ukraine pulls its forces out. \n \n Russia moved swiftly to step up its occupation of Crimea after Putin on Tuesday signed a treaty annexing the peninsula. Its most significant action was the takeover of the Ukrainian navy headquarters in Sevastopol, where pro-Russia militias and Russian regular troops stormed the base and checked Ukrainians at the gate as they left toting bags of personal belongings. \n \n The Ukrainian rear admiral in command, Serhiy Haiduk, was taken out of the compound in a car, and Ukrainian officials charged that the Russians had taken him hostage. \n \n Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov on Wednesday gave Crimean authorities three hours to release Haiduk and stop harassing the Ukrainian military or face “appropriate measures.” The deadline passed without apparent action. \n \n However, Haiduk was released Thursday morning, according to Turchynov’s office. Several pro-Ukrainian activists also were set free. \n \n Branigin reported from Washington.

President Obama effectively ruled out a military response to Russia's land grab yesterday, USA Today reports. ""We do not need to trigger an actual war with Russia,"" he told KSDK-TV, in an interview ostensibly about raising the minimum wage. ""The Ukrainians don't want that, nobody would want that."" But Obama said to expect ""even more disruptive economic actions that could have a significant impact on the Russian economy."" In other Ukraine news: Russian forces freed Ukraine's captured navy commander today, after Ukraine demanded the release of all hostages in Crimea, CNN reports. If they weren't freed by 9pm, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov threatened to take ""technical and technological"" action—meaning, likely, turning off Crimea's utilities. Russia's defense minister asked Crimea to free the hostages. Even though Ukraine is reportedly pulling troops from the region, its parliament issued a declaration today saying that it still considered Crimea part of the Ukraine, and that ""the Ukrainian people will never, under no circumstances, stop fighting for the liberation of Crimea from the occupants."" European leaders met today in Sevastopol to discuss further punitive action against Russia, with Angela Merkel saying the EU would issue more travel bans and asset freezes against Russians, the Washington Post reports. But analysts say the measures aren't strong enough to change Russian behavior. Ukraine, too, is taking only restrained steps. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday backed off Kiev's threat to impose a visa regime, saying it would likely be ineffective, and would inconvenience many Ukrainians. Russia, meanwhile, pulled out a threat of its own. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia might revise its stance on Iran's nuclear program in response to US and EU sanctions. ""We wouldn't like to use these talks as an element of the game of raising the stakes,"" he said, according to the AP. ""But if they force us into that, we will take retaliatory measures."""
