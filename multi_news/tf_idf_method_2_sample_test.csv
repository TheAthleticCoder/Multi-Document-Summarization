The paper reports Finley was fired by honchos at parent company Gannett on Monday evening after he was found to have repeatedly flouted its social media rules. ""We encourage our journalists to engage in a meaningful dialogue on social media, but ... the conversation [should] adhere to our overarching values of fairness, balance, and objectivity,"" says an exec from the USA Today Network, Gannett's main brand. Poynter explains Finley's demise came after he reacted to Vermont's proposal to add the gender option ""X"" to ""F"" and ""M"" on driver's licenses. The Washington Post documents the Twitter exchange between commenters who were lauding Vermont's decision and Finley. After one user noted the news was ""awesome,"" Finley replied: ""Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse."" When someone else tweeted the recognition of different genders was awesome, Finley wrote: ""All recognition? … What if someone said it's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I'm not being snarky, I'm just asking."" Poynter notes some readers threatened to cancel their Free Press subscriptions over the tweets. ""'Reader engagement' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree,"" an editor for a string of other local Vermont papers says. Emilie Stigliani, the Free Press' planning editor, will temporarily step in as Finley's replacement."

2,"['White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci took a page out of President Trump’s playbook Wednesday night with a tweet threatening to sic the FBI on a supposed information leaker. “In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting the FBI and the Justice Department,” Scaramucci wrote, inexplicably tagging White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Scaramucci did not specify what information was leaked, but a Politico article cited the incoming communications director’s required financial disclosure in reporting he earned $4.9 million since last year from his ownership stake in investment firm SkyBridge. Scaramucci appeared to delete the tweet, but in a subsequent post said Priebus was among the senior White House officials helping to crack down on leaks.', 'The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Scaramucci still stands to profit from SkyBridge from the White House The newly named White House communications director has earned millions from ownership stake since last year, according to his financial disclosure. \n \n Anthony Scaramucci finally has his White House job, but he still stands to profit from an ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital. \n \n The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The disclosure form, which is publicly available upon request, hasn’t been previously reported. \n \n The disclosure highlights the extensive wealth Scaramucci has accumulated in his career — much like many of Trump’s other top advisers and Cabinet secretaries — and also the challenge he faces in extracting himself from the potential conflicts his investments could pose. \n \n Scaramucci’s financial filing values SkyBridge Capital at more than $50 million and states that he owns nearly 44 percent of the firm. When the sale of the company is completed, expected to be in the third quarter of this year, he will receive “the agreed-upon purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds,” according to the filing. \n \n Bloomberg valued the Skybridge deal at between $200 million and $230 million when it was announced in January. \n \n “It’s black and white that he’s going to get money,” said Austin Evers, executive director at American Oversight, a watchdog group that focuses on transparency in government. \n \n The SkyBridge website continues to advertise Scaramucci as the firm\'s managing director, despite the fact that he has been a government employee for more than a month. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Scaramucci stepped down from the executive post Jan. 17, when the company’s sale was announced. He remained an employee of the firm, collecting a salary, until starting at Ex-Im last month. \n \n The investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. The sale, set in motion in January when Scaramucci was shedding his holdings in anticipation of landing an administration job, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and is taking longer than expected to close. \n \n The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is examining the deal to ensure that it carries no risk to national security. The panel’s review, which comes amid ramped-up scrutiny of business dealings with China, ultimately can be overruled by President Donald Trump. \n \n Scaramucci said Friday his start date wouldn’t be until August so that everything can be “100 percent totally cleansed and clean and I don’t see an issue with it.” \n \n White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom referred questions about Scaramucci’s SkyBridge investment to the Treasury. Treasury spokeswoman Marisol Garibay did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Scaramucci, a Trump fundraiser and frequent campaign surrogate whose appointment to an administration post was delayed in part because of the complicated nature of the SkyBridge sale, joined Ex-Im in June. \n \n Ex-Im was seen as a ""very temporary move,"" a way to get the Trump loyalist to Washington until a higher-level position could be found, according to one White House adviser. \n \n The bank is across the street from the White House, where Scaramucci was free to come and go thanks to security credentials that gave him 24-hour access. That allowed him to elude the detection of senior White House staffers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. \n \n Scaramucci has been on unpaid leave from Ex-Im since the day he started there, June 19, a bank spokeswoman said, forgoing his $172,100 salary as chief strategy officer. \n \n A friend said Scaramucci thought his stay at the bank would be longer-lived and that the White House job came unexpectedly. \n \n In his disclosure, Scaramucci listed assets worth as much as $85 million. He has several real estate investments, including single-family rental homes on Long Island. \n \n A minority stake in the New York Mets is worth as much as $5 million. He also is an investor in Juice Press, a chain of snack and smoothie shops in the Northeast. \n \n Scaramucci earned $200,000 in income from a majority stake in Hastings Capital Group, according to his financial disclosure. That ownership share also will be sold as part of the SkyBridge deal with RON and HNA. \n \n As a contributor to Fox News, Scaramucci earned about $88,000, according to his financial disclosure. \n \n He has three mortgages with U.S. Bank for a total liability of $2.5 million to $7 million. \n \n Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.', 'WASHINGTON — In the five days since he was named White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci has vowed to hunt down leakers and fire anyone he catches. By the end of his fifth day, he was on the receiving end of what he called a leak about himself. \n \n The financial disclosure form that Mr. Scaramucci filed with the government appeared on Politico’s website on Wednesday night, showing that he has assets worth as much as $85 million. He made $5 million in salary and another $4.9 million from his ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital in the first six months of this year, according to the filing. \n \n Mr. Scaramucci responded angrily. “In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony,” he wrote on Twitter, “I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept.” \n \n He added the hashtag #swamp, reflecting President Trump’s promise to drain the swamp, and then included the Twitter handle of Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, who opposed Mr. Scaramucci’s appointment last week.', 'Cornelia June Rogers Miller passed away in February of 2017, but her recent obituary has gone viral, stirring up controversy in her family and online.

They would go for a weekend in the winter,"" said Robert Miller, June\'s oldest son. \n \n Miller says it wasn\'t until last year that his father had to sell the summer home in Murphy. It was becoming too much for the couple to make the drive from Florida. \n \n Eventually, they both ended up in an assisted living facility. \n \n ""He was actually her roommate at the facility,"" Miller told NewsChannel 9. \n \n According to the obituary in the Cherokee Scout, June died in February. \n \n ""She was 82 years old, I believe, so she had a variety of complications,"" Miller explained when we asked how she passed. \n \n It wasn\'t until last week though, nearly four months after her death, that the obituary showed up in the paper. \n \n Part of it reads: ""There will be no service, no prayers, and no closure for the family she spent a lifetime tearing apart."" \n \n We sent it to June\'s son. \n \n ""The whole thing is just sad,"" Miller said. \n \n \n \n It most obituaries, you find a message honoring a person\'s life. That\'s not the case here. \n \n Another part read: ""Drugs were a major love in her life as June had no hobbies, made no contribution to society and rarely shared a kind word or deed in her life."" \n \n It goes on to say: ""We speak for the majority of the family when we say her presence will not be missed by many."" \n \n As we showed the obit to people in Murphy, they couldn\'t believe it. ""Yeah, it\'s disturbing,"" said one man. \n \n So, who wrote the obituary about June? We still don\'t know. \n \n But, June\'s son Robert has an idea. \n \n ""It\'s unbelievable that my sisters would write this,"" he said. \n \n We tracked down one of his sisters, but she says she didn\'t write it either. \n \n She called the obituary very tragic and very sad. \n \n \n \n ""It\'s really sad that they don\'t have anything better to do,"" Miller added. \n \n Robert just hopes the memories his father and mother shared in Murphy won\'t ever be forgotten, and wants his mother to be remembered as a loving, generous woman. \n \n Miller tells us he sent a new obit to the paper that will run next week. \n \n We wanted to know if the Cherokee Scout considered rejecting the obituary. When we asked, publisher David Brown said, ""the family\'s will overrode the editor."" \n \n Brown told us the paper does look through each obituary and they feel they should only edit something if there is a very compelling reason to do so. \n \n Brown wouldn\'t say who sent the original obituary in.']",4,"– New White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was not happy about what he believed was a leak of information from his financial disclosure Wednesday—though it later emerged that the form was available to the public.

(May 1) AP \n \n Marks of butchery evident on teen\'s remains discovered at the site. \n \n This August 2012 photo shows four shallow chops to an incomplete skull excavated in Jamestown, Va., by William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) Story Highlights During the \'starving time,\' only 60 of 300 colonists survived \n \n Researchers: Skull shows signs of cannibalization \n \n Final blow split the cranium open \n \n WASHINGTON -- Jamestown\'s colonists resorted to cannibalism during the ""starving time"" winter of 1609-10, archaeologists confirmed Wednesday. \n \n In a briefing at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of Natural History, archaeologist Doug Owsley presented the reconstructed skull of a 14-year-old English girl, named ""Jane"" by the researchers, discovered at the site of the fort and bearing the marks of butchery. \n \n ""The skull was split in half, most likely with a lightweight ax or quite possibly, a cleaver,"" Owsley said at the briefing. Cut marks crisscrossing the skull and jaw of the girl indicate her flesh, tongue and brains were removed from the skull, Owsley said. Those were traditional cuts for animal butchery of the time, ""all parts of the cuisine of the 17th century,"" he said. \n \n Jamestown was founded in 1607 by English colonists. The starving time was a period two years later in which 80% of the colonists died. Besieged by Powhatan Indians in their wooden fort, the settlers had been joined by new colonists late that summer, among them women and children, whose main supply ship had disappeared in a storm, leaving them without food. Only 60 of 300 people survived the winter. \n \n ""They were so emaciated when they were rescued that they were described as resembling skeletons,"" says historian James Horn of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, who spoke at the briefing. Records kept by the colony\'s governor, George Percy, make clear references to cannibalism during the winter, Horn says. ""The English would have only resorted to cannibalism under the most severe circumstances,"" he added. \n \n VIDEO: Cannibalism at Jamestown confirmed \n \n Owsley reported on the forensic analysis of 17th century human remains and a reconstruction of her appearance made by forensic scientists. The remains had been excavated by Jamestown archaeologists led by William Kelso of the Jamestown Recovery Project in 2012 as part of a 20-year excavation of the James Fort site. ""We don\'t believe Jane was a lone case,"" Kelso said. \n \n This April 2013 photo shows a forensic facial reconstruction produced by StudioEIS of Brooklyn, N.Y., in consultation with William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) \n \n ""This is amazingly interesting, but it also confirms stories of cannibalism from the settlers themselves,"" says Charles Mann, author of 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. ""Things were indeed terrible during those early years,"" Mann says, by email. \n \n While not all colonial-era historians agreed that cannibalism took place at Jamestown, most modern ones generally credited the accounts (one man was executed for eating his wife) as reliable. Horn and Owsley argued the butchery marks on Jane provide stronger evidence for the practice. ""No one can say with authoritative certainty exactly why this young lady was cut up, but given the context, it looks like butcher\'s marks,"" Owsley said. \n \n In the briefing, he identified a number of features on the skull and a shin bone that indicated that Jane was cannibalized. Four shallow chops to the forehead were attempted in a first, failed attempt to open the skull. The back of the head was then split open. The final blow split the cranium open. \n \n ""The person doing this was not a very good, or experienced butcher,"" Owsley said. Chop marks on the shin bone resemble more conventional butchers\' marks seen on animal bones from the time, indicating that more than one person may have been involved in cannibalizing the girl. She was doubtless one of the newly arrived settlers, though still not definitively identified. An exhibition devoted to the discovery will open this Friday at the Historic Jamestowne site, and her reconstructed face will be displayed at the Smithsonian museum. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/18cNUHU', 'Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, left, and Jamestown archaeologist William Kelso unveil the reconstruction from the remains of ""Jane,"" a 17th-century teenager from Jamestown who researchers believe may have been the victim of cannibalism at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington. \n \n May 1, 2013 Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, left, and Jamestown archaeologist William Kelso unveil the reconstruction from the remains of ""Jane,"" a 17th-century teenager from Jamestown who researchers believe may have been the victim of cannibalism at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington.

The next set, after the body was rolled over, was more effective. One cut split the skull all the way to the base. \n \n “The person is truly figuring it out as they go,” said Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution. \n \n In the meantime, someone — perhaps with more experience — was working on a leg. The tibia bone is broken with a single blow, as one might do in butchering a cow. \n \n That’s one possible version of an event that took place sometime during the winter of 1609-1610 in Jamestown. What’s certain is that some members of that desperate colony resorted to cannibalism to survive. \n \n That cannibalism occurred during the colony’s “starving time” was never in much doubt. At least a half-dozen accounts, by people who lived through the period or spoke to colonists who did, describe occasional acts of cannibalism that winter. They include reports of corpses being exhumed and eaten, a husband killing his wife and salting her flesh (for which he was executed), and the mysterious disappearance of foraging colonists. \n \n This 14-year old girl was eaten. She has been reconstructed after archaeologists found her bones in Jamestown, Virginia. Her remains show that she died during the “starving time” period and bare the telltale signs of cannibalism. (The Fold/The Washington Post) \n \n The proof comes in the form of fragments of a skeleton of a girl, about age 14, found in a cellar full of debris in the fort on the James River that sheltered the starving colonists. The skull, lower jaw and leg bone — all that remain — have the telltale marks of an ax or cleaver and a knife. \n \n “Historians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,” said Owsley, who has examined thousands of skeletal remains, both archaeological and forensic. “I think that it did. We didn’t see anybody eat this flesh. But it’s very strong evidence.” \n \n James Horn, head of research at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and a historian on the colony, said the discovery “adds a significant confirmation to what was reported to have occurred at Jamestown.” Further, it’s the only physical evidence of cannibalism of Europeans in any New World colony, although, as with Jamestown, there are written accounts of the practice in others. \n \n “I tend to be sparing in the use of words like ‘unique.’ But I think this is one of those finds that literally is,” Horn said. \n \n About 300 people inhabited the fort in November 1609. By spring, there were only 60. The girl, most likely a maidservant but possibly the daughter of a colonist, was one of the casualties. \n \n Her bones were unearthed last August as part of the Jamestown Rediscovery archaeological project begun in 1994. About 18 inches of fill remain in the cellar, so it’s possible more of her skeleton will be found. Enough of her skull exists, however, to imagine what she might have looked like, using CT scanning, computer graphics, sculpture materials and demographic data. \n \n The bones, the reconstruction of her head and the story were presented Wednesday at an event at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. The remains will be displayed at the Archaearium, the museum at the Jamestown fort archaeological site, starting this weekend. A warning sign at the room’s entrance notes that human remains are on view. There are no depictions of bodies being butchered, cooked or consumed. \n \n The starving time nearly ended the colony, which was riven by internal dissent, under attack by Powhatan Indians and short of food almost from its founding in 1607. A resupply fleet of nine vessels had left Plymouth, England, on June 2, 1609. Aboard, including crew, were 500 people, of which perhaps three dozen were women and girls. The fleet was struck by a hurricane on July 23, 1609. One ship sank. The flagship, Sea Venture, wrecked on Bermuda. Most of the passengers and crew escaped to the island, an event that became the kernel of William Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.” Among the survivors was the colony’s incoming lieutenant governor, Thomas Gates. (The marooned fashioned two boats from the wreck’s remains and miraculously sailed into Jamestown the next May.) \n \n The seven other ships, scattered and damaged, sailed on. Six arrived in mid-August, with the girl, whom the researchers have named “Jane,” almost certainly on one of them. The seventh ship arrived in October. \n \n The new arrivals — about 300 people — proved to be as much a drain on the colony as a relief. \n \n The ships’ crews hoarded provisions. The summer corn crop was enough to feed only about 50 people for a year. The colony’s military leader, Capt. John Smith, sent two groups of colonists upstream and downstream to fend for themselves. He was badly wounded in what was probably an assassination attempt and in October sailed home with the ships. By then, people were already going hungry. \n \n The girl’s bones were found mixed with those of a horse, dogs and squirrels — testament to the extreme food sources the colonists turned to that winter. They were part of the trash collected in a fort-wide cleanup and dumped in the cellar before the arrival of the colony’s governor, Lord De La Warr, the following June. \n \n The cause of her death isn’t known. The tentative cuts to the front of the skull and the deeper ones to the back are close together — evidence that she was dead, not squirming, when they were made. The temporal bone was pried off to reach the brain. There are dozens of cuts to the jaw, suggesting that muscle was stripped from it. \n \n Could the marks have been left by animals? \n \n “Not a chance,” Owsley said. “I deal with this all the time. Not a chance.” In fact, he says with confidence that the dissector or dissectors were right-handed. \n \n Chemical analysis of the bone reveals an enriched “nitrogen profile,” evidence of lots of protein in the girl’s diet. That, in turn, suggests she was a member of a high-born family or at least lived in such a household for much of her life. \n \n She wouldn’t have gone to Jamestown alone. Whoever accompanied her was probably dead by the time she became food for the starving. “If she’d had a family to protect her — after death as well as before — this probably wouldn’t have happened,” Horn said. \n \n Learning who she was will be difficult. Complete passenger lists for the voyages don’t exist. Research into the Virginia Company’s sponsors in Plymouth might reveal a family with a girl born in 1595 or 1596 who went to America.

They also chose not to depict her as she undoubtedly was before death — gaunt and emaciated. \n \n “But I didn’t make her look like a healthy, plump teenager either,” Owsley said. “I’m putting her in her circumstances.” \n \n Those include dirt on her face and a thousand-yard stare, but not, alas, her name.']",2,"– Scientists say they have the first physical evidence of a grisly truth from Jamestown: Colonists in the brutal winter of 1609 resorted to cannibalism, reports USA Today. Anthropologists studying the partial remains of a teenage girl—including her skull, jaw, and leg bone—say they bear the unmistakable marks of a cleaver and knife, reports the Washington Post. She had been, for lack of a better word, butchered. “Historians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,” says one of the Smithsonian scientists who worked on the project. “I think that it did. We didn’t see anybody eat this flesh, but it’s very strong evidence.” It's not clear whether the girl was a servant or perhaps the daughter of a colonist, or whether she was killed to be eaten or eaten after she died.

4,"['Click image above to view graphic \n \n Although the prospect of a pill for Alzheimer\'s remains a long way off, the landmark British study provides a major new pathway for future drug treatments. \n \n The compound works by blocking a faulty signal in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases, which shuts down the production of essential proteins, leading to brain cells being unprotected and dying off. \n \n It was tested in mice with prion disease - the best animal model of human neurodegenerative disorders - but scientists said they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases such as Alzheimer\'s or Parkinson\'s. \n \n The study, published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine, was carried out at the Medical Research Council\'s (MRC) Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester. \n \n “It\'s a real step forward,” team leader Professor Giovanna Mallucci told The Independent. “It\'s the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease. The fact that this is a compound that can be given orally, that gets into the brain and prevents brain disease, is a first in itself… We can go forward and develop better molecules and I can\'t see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice. I think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains.” \n \n In debilitating brain diseases like Alzheimer\'s, the production of new proteins in the brain is shut down by a build-up of “misfolded proteins” or amyloids. This build-up leads to an “over-activation” of a natural defence mechanism that stops essential proteins being produced. Without these proteins to protect them, brain cells die off - leading to the symptoms of diseases like Alzheimer\'s. \n \n The compound used in the study works by inhibiting an enzyme, known as PERK, which plays a key role in activating this defence mechanism. In mice with prion\'s disease, it restored proteins to protect brain cells “stopping the disease in its tracks”, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss. \n \n Although the compound also produced significant side effects in mice, including weight loss and mild diabetes, which was caused by damage to the pancreas, Professor Mallucci said it would “not be impossible” to develop a drug that protected the brain without the side effects and that work towards doing so had been “very promising”. \n \n The breakthrough was greeted with excitement by scientists, who nonetheless cautioned that it remained a significant proof of principle and a possible basis for new treatments, rather than a guarantee of an Alzheimer\'s cure in the near future. \n \n Computer graphic of a vertical (coronal) slice through the brain of an Alzheimer patient (credit: Science Photo Library) \n \n Professor Roger Morris, acting head King\'s College London\'s department of chemistry, said: “This is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer\'s disease. True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer\'s, that has been cured. However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer\'s disease in patients.” \n \n “From finding the first effective drug in a mouse, to having an effective medicine in man, usually takes decades to bring to fruition, in the very few cases in which it is successful. So, a cure for Alzheimer\'s is not just around the corner. However, the critical point of principle made by Professor Mallucci\'s study is that a drug, given orally, can arrest neurodegeneration caused by amyloid in the brain. \n \n ”This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\'s disease.“ \n \n David Allsopp, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University said that the study had thrown up ”very dramatic and highly encouraging results“, but said that more research was needed to overcome the ""problematic side-effects"" and to prove the technique would be effective against other disease like Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s. \n \n There are currently 800,000 people in the UK with dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease is the most common cause. The number of people living with the condition is set to break one million by 2021, and represents an enormous health burden for the NHS and the social care system. Parkinson\'s affect 1 in 500 people and around 127,000 people suffer from the condition. \n \n Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer\'s Research UK, said: ""Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage. It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\'s disease. While Alzheimer\'s is the most common form of dementia, other diseases that cause dementia are also characterised by the abnormal build-up of proteins in the brain. \n \n “If this process is also working overtime in these conditions too, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation. However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people and the ultimate test for this compound will be to see whether it is safe and effective in people with these diseases.”', 'Scientists are hailing a landmark British study which has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s by stopping the death of neurons. \n \n The Medical Research Council (MRC) team focused on the root cause of many degenerative brain diseases - abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres. \n \n When enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain it can trigger a reaction that results in the death of nerve cells. \n \n Other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein, whose structure is folded the wrong way. \n \n But this research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins. \n \n Using a drug injected into the stomachs of mice through a mouth tube, they flipped a cellular switch from ""off"" to ""on"" to prevent neurons dying. \n \n Five weeks after treatment one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes and limb dragging. \n \n They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. \n \n During the study, a neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal prion proteins was induced in the mice. \n \n Prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), are rare in humans but share the same underlying cause - misfolded proteins - as more common conditions such as Alzheimer\'s. \n \n Lead scientist Professor Giovanna Mallucci, from the MRC Toxicology Unit, said: ""We were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice."" \n \n The scientists stress human trials are a long way off and point out that the mice suffered serious side effects, including significant weight loss and raised blood sugar. \n \n But they also believe the research demonstrates in principle the possibility of developing an oral treatment - a pill or swallowed liquid - that can protect the brain from neurodegenerative disease. \n \n The research is at a very early stage and it could be a decade or more before the medicine is actually developed. \n \n But experts said the findings were highly significant. \n \n Professor Roger Morris, from King\'s College London, said: ""This is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer\'s disease. \n \n ""True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer\'s, that has been cured. \n \n ""However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer\'s disease in patients."" \n \n He added: ""This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\'s disease."" \n \n Professor David Allsop, from the University of Lancaster, said: ""Inhibiting this pathway has produced some very dramatic and highly encouraging results in mice infected with prion disease. \n \n ""The main caveats of the research, however, are that prion disease is very rare in humans, and it is not yet clear if the same approach will be viable for much more common neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer\'s disease and Parkinson\'s disease. \n \n ""More research is needed to determine if this approach is valid for any condition other than prion disease, and also to find ways of getting around these problematic side-effects.""']",2,"– Scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point: In a new study, a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice, meaning we're one step closer to a pill that can treat Alzheimer's, the Independent reports. Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial ""shutdown,"" thus basically flipping the switch from ""off"" back to ""on."" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease. Now the bad news: The mice did suffer side effects, including weight loss and diabetes.

The StEP Initiative created a map of the world\'s e-waste, which is available online. [Infographic: Tracking the World\'s E-Waste] \n \n Until now, comprehensive data on global e-waste has been hard to come by, and countries define e-waste very differently.

[ See full-size infographic Credit: Ross Toro, Infographic Artist \n \n The interactive e-waste map shows data from 184 countries on the estimated amount of electrical and electronic equipment that hits the market and how much e-waste it ultimately generates. Having this data could help governments and companies manage their e-waste. \n \n The world produced nearly 54 million tons (49 million metric tons) of used electrical and electronic products last year. That\'s an average of about 43 lbs. (20 kg), or the weight of eight bricks, for each of the 7 billion people on Earth. \n \n The StEP Initiative forecasts that by 2017, the world will produce about 33 percent more e-waste, or 72 million tons (65 million metric tons). That amount weighs about 11 times as much as the Great Pyramid of Giza. \n \n China currently leads the world in production of electrical and electronic equipment. In 2012, China produced about 12.2 million tons (11.1 million metric tons), followed by the U.S. with about 11 million tons (10 million metric tons). \n \n However, the United States eclipses China in e-waste generation, because more products previously put on the market in the U.S. are likely to be retired. In 2012, the U.S. produced about 10.4 million tons (9.4 million metric tons), versus China\'s 8 million tons (7.3 million metric tons). \n \n The U.S. generated the seventh highest amount of e-waste per person — about 66 lbs.

And now, a world e-waste map — the first of its kind — shows just how staggering. \n \n The average Canadian, for example, generated about 24 kilograms of e-waste in 2012. That’s more than 860,000 tonnes for the entire country, roughly equivalent to the weight of about 1,700 fully loaded Boeing 747s at take off. \n \n But the biggest producer of e-waste is the United States, with an astonishing 9,359,000 tonnes produced in 2012, about 29 kilograms per person, according to the map, which was created by a number of agencies through their “solving e-waste problem” (StEP) initiative. \n \n The numbers are mind-boggling, said Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University in St. John’s, N.L., and a member of StEP. \n \n “The main purpose (of the map) is to give a sense how much electronic waste is present in any given any country,” said Lepawsky. \n \n It also allows a comparison between purchasing power in different countries, which is a measure of wealth, he said. \n \n (The richer the country, the more e-waste it generally generates.) \n \n By 2017, the volume of discarded e-products worldwide is expected to be 33 per cent higher than in 2012 and weigh the equivalent of eight of the Great Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n Haiti is among the lowest producers of e-waste in the world, with less than 8,000 tonnes produced in 2012, or less than one kilogram per person. \n \n Afghanistan, too, was among the lowest in the world, with less than 19,000 tonnes of e-waste for the country, or 0.58 kilogram per person. \n \n The map is surprising in parts, said Lepawsky. \n \n Singapore is much wealthier than Canada, he said, “when you look at e-waste generated.” In Singapore, a tiny country, the average person generated about 36 kilograms in 2012. \n \n “The world is changing quite quickly,” he said. \n \n Luxembourg is another example. \n \n It has a much smaller population than the U.S., 520,000, compared to more than 314 million, but more new electrical and electronic equipment comes to the market in Luxembourg per capita. \n \n (The U.S. is the largest consumer in absolute terms but it is behind Luxembourg in per capita terms.) \n \n It is a disheartening number, said Miriam Diamond, a professor in the department of earth sciences at the University of Toronto, referring to the e-waste that emanates from Canada. \n \n “It represents throwing away a tremendous amount of energy that went into making it in the first place.” \n \n Used electronics often make their way to the developing world where some are reused. \n \n But, Diamond says, “In a lot of the recycling sector, they are dismantled by hand. That is a serious threat to health and the environment.” \n \n Innovation is a trademark in the world of electronics, especially in the world of cellphones, laptops and computers, where engineers come up with distinct, sleek styles to lure people to buy more. \n \n “Why won’t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?” she asked. \n \n The cost of mining new resources is also staggering. \n \n “These minerals that we mine are scarce. . . is it worth it? Mining, too, has negative impact on people and places.” \n \n For Lepawsky, the solution to the tonnes of e-waste is relatively simple. \n \n “Stop buying new electronics; use what you have for longer,” he said, adding that sometimes buying new products is about fashion more than anything else.', 'An employee holds circuit boards at the Coopermiti warehouse of electronic waste in Sao Paulo March 6, 2013. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Brazil generates the greatest amount of electronic waste (e-waste) per capita among emerging countries. \n \n OSLO (Reuters) - China and other emerging economies have overtaken Western nations in dumping old electronic goods, from TVs to cellphones, and will lead a projected 33 percent surge in the amount of waste from 2012 to 2017, a U.N.-backed alliance said on Sunday. \n \n The report, the first to map electronic waste by country to promote recycling and safer disposal of often toxic parts, shows how the economic rise of developing nations is transforming the world economy even in terms of pollution. \n \n ""The e-waste problem requires attention globally,"" Ruediger Kuehr of the U.N. University and executive secretary of the Solving the E-Waste Problem (StEP) initiative, told Reuters. StEP is run by U.N. agencies, governments, NGOs and scientists. \n \n The weight of electronic goods discarded every year worldwide would rise to 65.4 million tonnes from 2012 to 2017 from 48.9 million in 2012, with most of the growth in developing nations, StEP said. \n \n By 2017, it would make the annual piles of old washing machines, computers, fridges, electronic toys and other goods with an electric cord or battery the weight equivalent of 200 Empire State Buildings or 11 Great Pyramids of Giza, it said. \n \n Some waste from rich countries ends up in developing nations, where many people work in hazardous conditions for low wages dismantling it. \n \n Waste from emerging countries, as well as Russia and other former Soviet bloc nations, overtook totals from Western nations such as the United States, the European Union, Japan and Australia around 2012, StEP data showed. \n \n In that year, the West produced 23.5 million tonnes of waste and all others 25.4 million, a shift from the previous estimates for 2007 when the West accounted for most, StEP said. \n \n MOUNTAINS OF TRASH \n \n By 2017, trash from the West would rise to 28.6 million tonnes, far less than the 36.7 million from other countries, a side-effect of the economic rise of emerging nations such as India, Brazil and South Africa. \n \n ""Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,"" Kuehr said in the report. \n \n Consumers could help with better recycling, especially at Christmas, he said. \n \n Waste can be valuable if recycled. One study estimated that a million cellphones can yield 24 kg (53 lb) of gold, 250 kg of silver, 9 kg of palladium and more than 9 tonnes of copper. \n \n Sunday\'s report also showed that the average person on the planet produces 7 kg of electronic waste every year. Americans were among the highest with 29.8 kg each. \n \n Separately, U.S.-based experts trying to track the fate of waste said that about two-thirds of U.S. electronics waste is collected for re-use or recycling and that only 8.5 percent of the collected units are exported. \n \n Bigger electronic items, especially TVs and computer monitors, were exported to nations including Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay and China, it said. Smaller items often went to Asia. \n \n Jeremy Gregory, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the report, told Reuters it was hard to track trade because the waste is often merely described as ""mixed metals"" on import documents. \n \n StEP urged nations to adopt clearer trade descriptions. \n \n For StEP maps, click here: here \n \n (Editing by Alison Williams)']",3,"– Electronic waste is growing at a staggering rate—Americans alone chucked an average of 65 pounds of old electronic goods each last year—and it is set to surge another 33% within five years unless consumers and producers change their ways, LiveScience reports. Most of the waste ends up in developing nations, and those countries plus the former Soviet bloc now produce more electronic waste of their own than Western nations, according to a new map that tracks the problem worldwide for the first time. The world produced around 54 million tons of electronic waste in total last year, researchers found, and though it can be valuable—a million old cell phones can yield 53 pounds of gold and 550 pounds of silver, Reuters notes—recycling rates remain low and where e-waste is recycled, it is often done so in a way harmful to both the environment and workers' health.

6,"['""Tonight Show"" host Jay Leno is taking a significant reduction in pay and roughly two dozen staffers are being let go as part of a major budget restructuring at the late-night talk show. \n \n Although ""The Tonight Show"" remains the top-rated late-night program, from a financial standpoint it is only break-even, according to a person familiar with the economics of the show. One reason for that is that the production budget of the show was not reduced when Leno moved back to late night after his ill-fated stint in prime time during the 2009-10 television season. \n \n Leno\'s current salary is between $25 million and $30 million and he volunteered to take a cut if it would save some jobs. A person close to the network thought Leno\'s new salary is likely around $20 million. Bruce Bobbins, one of Leno\'s spokesmen, declined to comment. \n \n [Updated at 10:49 a.m., Aug. 18: In a statement later Bobbins said, ""Jay\'s foremost concern is for the wonderful people who work for \'The Tonight Show.\' He did what was necessary to ensure their well-being.""] \n \n While an NBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the situation, the job losses are said to be between 20 and 25 people and many other senior staffers also agreed to pay cuts. \n \n The weekly budget for Leno\'s prime time show was approximately $2.3 million and it stayed there when he returned to late night and Conan O\'Brien was sent packing. The budget now will be closer to $1.7 million, which is in the range of what it was during Leno\'s previous late-night stint. \n \n Leno is not the first late-night host to agree to a salary reduction. In 2009, CBS restructured David Letterman\'s deal and reduced his salary and the budget of the show. \n \n Whether NBC will look to other areas to make additional cuts is yet to be determined. Earlier this year, the network trimmed its marketing and promotions staff. \n \n News of the cuts were first reported by Deadline Hollywood. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Movie review: \'Cosmopolis\' \n \n Moviegoers still wary of theaters after Aurora shootings \n \n Robert Pattinson tries to separate professional and personal lives', 'Related: Tonight Show Cuts Latest In Wave Of NBC Layoffs & Cost Trims Imposed By Comcast \n \n SATURDAY UPDATE: Jay Leno’s spokesman has now issued this statement: ”Jay’s foremost concern is for the wonderful people who work for The Tonight Show.

Others tell me the number is more like 25, and producers were forced to take pay cuts or lose their jobs. I’ve also learned that Jay Leno took what is being described as a “tremendous” pay cut to “save as many people’s jobs as he could”. Leno’s Tonight Show is consistently the #1 late night talk show in both households and demographics, except for some anomalies when Leno does get beaten. And that’s despite the fact that the network’s primetime ratings have been dismal for many years or that Leno himself was harshly criticized by the media for that January 2010 standoff with Conan O’Brien. Even so, The Tonight Show has been and still is a cash cow for NBC. So what happened to merit the downsizing? “I don’t think ad sales are off. I just think the people who bought this company, Comcast, wants to go through everything at NBC and get their money back,” an NBC insider tells me. ”It’s hard to go through those kinds of cuts. It’s more a network issue than a late-night issue. And I would say that Jay doesn’t get credit for digging out of a gigantic hole every single night. He’s a very valuable guy to NBC and someday everyone will understand that. He does a great job.” \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give ‘Tonight Show’ A Bump \n \n The downsizing also comes just 5 days after First Lady Michelle Obama appeared as a guest for the third time on The Tonight Show: high unemployment, job creation, and taxing the rich vs the poor all are issues in the 2012 president campaign. Leno has said publicly that he’s able to bank his entire Tonight Show salary and live on the hefty fees he makes from his hectic personal appearance schedule. Leno’s new salary is reportedly $27M-$30 million a year. He reportedly brings home another $15M-$20M a year from his other gigs. \n \n Leno replaced Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show in 1992 after having been a regular substitute host since 1987. He “officially” ended hosting of The Tonight Show in 2009 when Conan O’Brien started on June 1st. Leno was going to be paid for all of 2009 by NBC even though he was only working six months of it. When his ratings dipped, O’Brien was asked to move The Tonight Show‘s time slot later to make room for Leno’s return at 11:30 PM. O’Brien refused. NBC gave Conan a $40M payoff (including salaries for his staff) to leave The Tonight Show hosting job which Leno resumed in 2010. \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give ‘Tonight Show’ A Bump \n \n Jay Leno Celebrates 20th Anniversary Hosting ‘The Tonight Show’ \n \n Jimmy Kimmel Bests Leno & Letterman \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here.']",2,"– Jay Leno has long said he lives off his standup money and takes the millions he gets paid for hosting the Tonight Show and sticks it right in the bank.

The numbers require some guesswork, but the LAT thinks he went from somewhere between $25 million and $30 million down to about $20 million. Finke's numbers are higher. According to both accounts, Leno volunteered to take the cuts to save jobs, though at least 20 people got layoffs. Why the downsizing? Finke says it's not because of concerns about ratings or ad revenue, but because parent company Comcast is demanding cuts all around. She says the show is still a ""cash cow.""

10,"['* Technology spotted antibodies for disease in blood \n \n * Findings need to be confirmed \n \n By Julie Steenhuysen \n \n CHICAGO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. researchers have developed a way to harness the immune system to test for Alzheimer\'s, an approach they say could lead to a blood test for the disease within months. \n \n A study of the technology showed it accurately spotted Alzheimer\'s in blood samples from six people with the disease, Thomas Kodadek of the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida, wrote on Thursday in the journal Cell. \n \n The approach may work in other diseases, like cancer, Kodadek said in a telephone interview. \n \n The test looks for antibodies, or immune-system proteins, that help the body attack foreign invaders. \n \n Antibodies fight off infections but Kodadek said researchers are beginning to think that most diseases cause changes in cells that make the body see the cells as foreign invaders. \n \n He believes the body may produce antibodies in response to a range of diseases and would like to develop blood tests that look for them. \n \n His team used laboratory-made molecules called peptoids as antigen surrogates to screen for antibodies specific to Alzheimer\'s disease. \n \n Three of them reacted strongly to the blood of the six patients with Alzheimer\'s disease, but not with blood from healthy people. \n \n Kodadek said he has since tested more samples, including samples from people with mild cognitive impairment, an early sign of Alzheimer\'s, and the test is holding up. \n \n Kodadek has licensed the technology to Miami-based OPKO Health Inc (OPK.A), which will develop diagnostic kits, which he thinks could be available in six to seven months. \n \n ""The immediate utility of that is to help pharmaceutical companies stratify patients for clinical trials,"" he said. \n \n The team has tried to determine whether the test can distinguish among different neurodegenerative diseases, like lupus and Parkinson\'s. ""We\'ve even looked at a couple of other forms of dementia. These really do appear to be quite specific to Alzheimer\'s,"" Kodadek said. \n \n They also used the test on blood from 200 elderly people not suffering from dementia and found 8 percent had elevated concentrations of the same antibodies found in Alzheimer\'s patients, which suggests the test may work as an early predictor of disease.', 'Executive Health \n \n Early Steps Toward an Alzheimer\'s Blood Test \n \n Different immune system proteins exist in the blood of people with the disease, study finds \n \n THURSDAY, Jan. 6 (HealthDay News) -- A blood test that screens for antibodies, a protein produced by the immune system, may one day be used to detect Alzheimer\'s and other diseases, new research suggests. \n \n Though the research is still in its infancy, being able to detect Alzheimer\'s via antibodies would be a simpler and less invasive method of diagnosing the disease, researchers said. \n \n But the study\'s lead author stressed that the true benefits of such a test for Alzheimer\'s patients won\'t really arise until scientists develop effective treatments against the disease. \n \n ""It\'s unclear whether people would want to know a couple of years ahead of time they are going to get Alzheimer\'s if they can\'t do anything about it,"" said Thomas Kodadek, a professor of chemistry and cancer biology at The Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Fla. ""But I can say with some certainty that we will never get a good therapy for Alzheimer\'s without early diagnosis."" \n \n The study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is published in the Jan. 7 issue of Cell. \n \n Typically, in developing blood tests for diseases, researchers have searched for antigens -- that is, proteins from a virus, bacteria or other disease process such as cancer or neurological conditions like Alzheimer\'s -- that set off an immune response. \n \n Only after identifying the antigen would researchers then search for antibodies to that antigen, or signs that the immune system had picked up on the problem and mounted a response. \n \n But antigens can be difficult to find, Kodadek explained. \n \n ""In Alzheimer\'s, or in a disease such as cancer, it\'s not at all obvious what the initiating event is,"" he said. ""We just don\'t know what are those first weirdly modified proteins that are unique to the disease process that the immune system \'sees.\'"" \n \n The new research went about things differently. Rather than search for the elusive antigen, researchers did ""high throughput"" screening using thousands of synthetic molecules, called peptoids, that would bind with the antibodies. \n \n Comparing blood samples from six Alzheimer\'s patients, six healthy people and six Parkinson\'s disease patients, the researchers found that two of the thousands of synthetic molecules ""captured"" at least three-fold more immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies from all six of the Alzheimer\'s patients than from either the healthy controls or the Parkinson\'s patients. \n \n The synthetic molecules, in effect, acted as a lure for the antibodies -- enabling the researchers to spot biomarkers in the blood unique to those with Alzheimer\'s. \n \n This process could be repeated to test for antibodies associated with other diseases as well, Kodadek theorized. \n \n ""The big advance from what people have been doing before is that this method completely removes the requirement of knowing the native antigens that triggered the immune response,"" Kodadek said. ""The real excitement is it should allow us to identify biomarkers for any disease for which the immune system reacts."" \n \n The synthetic molecules are easily modifiable and can be produced quickly in large quantities at lower cost, Kodadek said. \n \n However, while promising, the results are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger numbers of patients, noted Dr. Jeremy Koppel, an Alzheimer\'s research scientist at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y. He was not involved in the new research. \n \n ""This study represents a novel approach to the development of a noninvasive screening instrument for conditions such as Alzheimer\'s disease, which currently lack definitive diagnostic biomarkers,"" Koppel said. ""Beyond diagnostics, the future identification of the biomarkers detected in this study has the potential to deepen our understanding of the disease process itself."" \n \n Another caveat is that the study was done in people who already had Alzheimer\'s, not those merely at risk for the disease. Further research needs to be done to determine how soon into the progression of the disease the abnormal antibodies can be detected. \n \n Right now, there are a few medications that can help with the symptoms of Alzheimer\'s, but there are no treatments that slow the progression of the disease. \n \n So for many patients, early diagnosis may not necessarily be something they want, Kodadek said. But from a research perspective, early diagnosis is a key to developing better treatment, he added. \n \n With neurodegenerative diseases, the hope is that drugs could block further decline, making it crucial to know if a person has the disease before they begin having significant symptoms, he said. \n \n More information \n \n The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more on Alzheimer\'s. \n \n SOURCES: Thomas Kodadek, Ph.D., professor, chemistry and cancer biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, Fla; Jeremy Koppel, M.D., Alzheimer\'s research scientist, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, N.Y.; Jan. 7, 2011, Cell \n \n Copyright © 2011 HealthDay.

Late Monday, however, the Diocese of Dallas said a Pennsylvania grand jury report describing more than 1,000 victims of abuse by clergy since the 1940s had motivated the disclosure after victims objected to an announcement in March, per Fox 4. Officials suspect Paredes is in his native Philippines, which he visited annually, per WFAA. Per the Morning News, authorities there say they are unaware of his location."

(Photo by Todd Williamson/Invision for LA friendly House/File) (Associated Press) \n \n PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Author and actor Christopher Kennedy Lawford, who was born into political and Hollywood royalty, sank into substance abuse and addiction and rose to become a well-known advocate for sobriety and recovery, has died. \n \n Lawford died of a heart attack Tuesday in Vancouver, Canada, his cousin, former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, told The Associated Press. He was 63. \n \n Lawford was in Vancouver living with his girlfriend and working to open a recovery center. He had been doing hot yoga, which he did often, but the strain of it ""must have been too much for him at that point,"" Kennedy said. \n \n Lawford was the only son and oldest child of Patricia Kennedy — sister of John, Robert and Ted Kennedy — and Peter Lawford — the English actor and socialite who was a member of Frank Sinatra\'s ""Rat Pack."" \n \n ""I was given wealth, power and fame when I drew my first breath,"" Lawford wrote in his 2005 book, ""Symptoms of Withdrawal: A Memoir of Snapshots and Redemption,"" the first of several books he wrote about his substance struggles. \n \n He wrote that his parents got telegrams predicting big things for him from Bing Crosby and Dean Martin and said he once got a lesson in doing ""The Twist"" from Marilyn Monroe. The cover of his books shows him sitting poolside as a child with his uncle and soon-to-be-president John F. Kennedy looming behind him. \n \n He spent his youth frolicking with Hollywood stars on one coast and rubbing shoulders with political stars on the other, living between libertine Los Angeles and the hyper-competitive Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where he was a big-brother figure to John F. Kennedy Jr. \n \n ""You can\'t get much more fawned over than being a Kennedy male,"" Lawford wrote. \n \n His life with drugs began with LSD while at boarding school at age 14. In the years before he had experienced the assassinations of his two uncles and his parents\' divorce in 1966. \n \n With heroin and other opioids as his substances of choice, Lawford leapt into deeper substance abuse in drug-heavy 1970s Hollywood, where his father also abused drugs and alcohol as his career faded. Peter Lawford died in 1984. Patricia Kennedy died in 2006. \n \n In his memoir, Christopher Lawford told tales of mugging women for money, panhandling in Grand Central Station and getting arrested twice for drug possession before getting sober at 30. \n \n ""There are many days when I wish I could take back and use my youth more appropriately,"" Lawford told The Associated Press in 2005. ""But all of that got me here. I can\'t ask for some of my life to be changed and still extract the understanding and the life that I have today."" \n \n Patrick Kennedy, the former congressman from Rhode Island whose father is Edward M. Kennedy, said his cousin ""did something very difficult,"" airing family secrets and temporarily hurting his relationships within the Kennedy clan when he wrote his book. \n \n ""He had the courage to know that he had to find himself, and he wasn\'t going to be able to do it while holding on to the old family narrative,"" Kennedy said. \n \n Lawford was ""tormented by the fact"" that for a time he was estranged from his sisters, Patrick Kennedy said. \n \n ""Over the years of recovery, he ended up reconciling with his sisters, happiest I ever saw him,"" Kennedy said. \n \n His life\'s work became helping others recover — including his cousin. \n \n ""He was the absolute cornerstone to my sobriety, along with my wife,"" Patrick Kennedy said (the former politician had been addicted to drugs and alcohol). ""He was the one who walked me through all the difficult days of that early period."" \n \n After his memoir, Lawford authored several more books on addiction and recovery, most recently 2015\'s ""What Addicts Know."" \n \n He worked steadily as an actor, with moderate success. He had a small part in 2003\'s ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" made appearances on TV shows including ""Frazier"" and ""The O.C."" and had recurring roles on the soaps ""All My Children"" and ""General Hospital,"" playing a senator in the latter. \n \n He told the AP in 2005 that his famous dual identities both helped and hurt him in Hollywood. \n \n ""The names give you entree, absolutely, but it\'s a kind of a double-edged sword,"" he said. ""People do pay attention to you, but nobody gets ahead in Hollywood unless they are really lucky or they deserve it."" \n \n He is survived by his sisters, Sydney, Victoria and Robin, and his children, David, Savannah and Matt. \n \n ___ \n \n Dalton reported from Los Angeles.', 'JFK\'s Nephew Christopher Lawford Dead at 63 After Yoga Studio Emergency \n \n JFK\'s Nephew Christopher Lawford Dead at 63 After Yoga Studio Emergency \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n 10:45 AM PT: Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Lawford was at a yoga studio Tuesday night when he had a medical emergency and later died.

13,"['Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement — coming on the heels of the chaotic, ugly realpolitik that followed Justice Antonin Scalia’s death — is a good moment to step back and realize just how broken the process for selecting Supreme Court justices now is. \n \n In 2016, Senate Republicans responded to Antonin Scalia’s death by inventing and establishing the absurd faux principle that open seats on the Supreme Court cannot be filled in an election year. Given that America hosts national elections one out of every two years, that means, in theory, that Supreme Court seats should remain unfilled fully 50 percent of the time. \n \n Democrats, infuriated by the GOP’s treatment of President Obama and Merrick Garland, filibustered Neil Gorsuch — the kind of broadly qualified nominee who would’ve passed easily in previous eras. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. \n \n What we are seeing here is a case of what the political scientist Steven Smith calls “Senate syndrome”: One side breaks a norm or rule, then the other side breaks another in response, and the tit-for-tat escalates until the underlying process is in ruins. That’s now happened with Supreme Court nominations. \n \n Here, in truth, is where the past few years have left us. The minority party no longer holds a scintilla of power over Supreme Court picks. The majority party can and will jam whomever they want onto the Court, where that person will serve for life. But in times when the Senate and the White House are controlled by different parties — which happens fairly often — there’s almost no chance that any seat on the Court will be filled. \n \n Imagine, for a minute, that Democrats win the Senate in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg retires in 2019. What are the chances, given the precedent of the past few years, that Senate Democrats will permit Trump to replace Ginsburg and give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court? I’d guess somewhere between zero and zero. \n \n This is an insane way to manage one of the most powerful institutions in American life. But the decorous, gentle equilibrium of yesteryear was also nonsensical. There’s always been something bizarre about the idea that a position as important, as long-serving, and as irreversible as Supreme Court justice should be made based on qualifications rather than ideology. \n \n Politics isn’t a résumé competition, it’s a contest for power, and the wielding of that power has real consequences. In practice, the Supreme Court decides how elections are funded, whether abortions are legal, whether millions of people will continue to have health insurance — if elected politicians and activist groups see its composition as a matter of life and death, that’s because it often is. \n \n Yes, Garland was relatively moderate, but if he had replaced Scalia, he would’ve swung the Court to a 5-4 liberal majority, leading to a slew of transformative rulings Republicans would find abhorrent. Yes, Gorsuch was qualified, but he has ruled in ways Democrats find awful, and the clarity of his opinions will not soften their effects. \n \n For that reason, I don’t blame Republicans for blocking Garland. Nor do I blame Democrats for filibustering Gorsuch. And I do not expect Republicans to give Democrats a sliver of oversight over Kennedy’s replacement. \n \n But the result of both sides taking SCOTUS nominations as seriously as they deserve to be taken is disastrous — it will become common for seats on the Court, perhaps multiple at one time, to remain open for years, and when they are filled, they will be filled with more extreme candidates. \n \n The core problem here is the stakes of Supreme Court nominations: They’re too damn high. Candidates serve for life — which, given modern life spans and youthful nominees, can now mean 40 years of decisions — and no one knows when the next seat will open. President Jimmy Carter served four years and saw no open seats. President George H.W. Bush served four years and filled two. Barack Obama served eight years and named two justices. Donald Trump isn’t even two years into his presidency and he’s already been given two vacancies. \n \n The result isn’t merely an undemocratic branch of government but a randomly undemocratic branch of government. And that randomness, and the stakes of seeing it play out in your side’s favor, makes it necessary to turn Supreme Court nominations into bloodsport. It creates incentives for justices to stay on the bench long after the point at which they should’ve retired, in the hopes that they can outlast an ideologically unfriendly administration — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, is 85, but it’s hard to imagine she won’t do everything in her physical power to hang onto her seat until a Democrat can replace her. It biases presidents toward nominating the youngest qualified jurist they can find, rather than the best jurist they can find. \n \n We need to deescalate Supreme Court fights. The most obvious way to do that is to limit terms. Holding justices to a 10-year, nonrenewable term would lower the stakes of any individual Supreme Court nomination as well as make the timing of fights more predictable. An idea like this could have bipartisan support — Gov. Rick Perry proposed 18-year terms in the 2012 campaign, making an argument that I think sounds even more persuasive today: \n \n Doing this would move the court closer to the people by ensuring that every President would have the opportunity to replace two Justices per term, and that no court could stretch its ideology over multiple generations. Further, this reform would maintain judicial independence, but instill regularity to the nominations process, discourage Justices from choosing a retirement date based on politics, and will stop the ever-increasing tenure of Justices. \n \n Implementing a reform like this would be a step toward repairing and normalizing a process that is now dangerously broken, infuriatingly random, and distorting both our politics and the judges we choose to interpret our laws.', ""The fight over President Trump Donald John TrumpScaramucci warns Trump must 'change tactics now' on trade Trump sought to purchase historic Scottish building for hotel: report Republican wins right to replace Farenthold in Congress MORE’s next nomination to the Supreme Court began almost immediately after the news broke of the opening on Wednesday. \n \n Moments after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said he would retire, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSunday shows preview: Supreme Court fight in the spotlight Appeals court nominees languish in Senate as Flake demands tariff vote Gillibrand incorrectly claims no Democrats voted for Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee MORE (R-Ky.) said the Senate would act before the midterm election to confirm Trump’s next nominee. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n “We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. \n \n Democrats immediately cried foul, arguing the nomination fight should come next year. \n \n Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerOvernight Health Care: Judge blocks Kentucky Medicaid work requirements | Trump officials consider cuts to ObamaCare outreach | House probes HHS office in charge of migrant children Overnight Health Care: Amazon enters the pharmacy business | Two Republicans to play pivotal role in Supreme Court abortion fight | Senate panel approves medical research boost Lewandowski: Pelosi is not the leader of the Democratic Party MORE (N.Y.), recalling the bitter fight over Merrick Garland Merrick Brian GarlandBattle over Trump court pick to be most expensive ever Mitch McConnell’s gamble is about to pay off — big time Dem senator: No argument will 'lay bare' GOP's hypocrisy on Supreme Court MORE’s nomination to the court in 2016, demanded that McConnell hold off until a new Congress is seated in 2019.

Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an ""insane"" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions."

Drones may not fly above 400ft (122m). \n \n But the latest incident will only add to the pressure for further steps to be taken. \n \n The US recently introduced a compulsory registration scheme so any drone recovered from an accident can be traced back to its owner. \n \n In addition, officials could make it mandatory for drones to run geo-fencing software - that would prevent them flying in restricted areas. \n \n The Department for Transport has promised to publish a strategy for unmanned aircraft this year. \n \n Pilots have also called for it to fund tests into what would happen if a drone got sucked into an engine or crashed into a plane\'s windscreen. \n \n Last month, the British Airline Pilots Association noted that while the threat of bird strikes had been well researched, there was little data about how much damage a drone could cause a plane. \n \n The incident follows a warning earlier this year by the head of the International Air Transport Association Tony Tyler that drones flown by the general public are ""a real and growing threat"" to civilian aircraft. \n \n The UK Air Proximity Board - which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace - said there had been a number of serious near-misses at UK airports involving drones. \n \n David Black, from Blackwing Aerial Services - a company that specialises in licensed commercial drones - said education and enforcement of the current rules were important, particularly for hobbyists. \n \n ""I think a register is a good idea,"" he said. \n \n ""With firearms it has shown it\'s a good thing... but it has not stopped bad guys from getting guns. If you\'re going to use them as weapons, bad guys can build them themselves. \n \n ""You need enforcement, but the problem with enforcement is that it costs money and people to carry it out.... There needs to be better technology for detection and avoidance."" \n \n Geo-fencing is available in some drones - a database within the drone will not let it take off if it is near an airport so that operators cannot accidentally fly into trouble. \n \n Mr Landells from Balpa added: ""The law as it stands says you\'re not supposed to go above 400ft (122m) or 500m away from the base unit, depending on the drone you\'re using, but we\'ve been seeing incidents up at 8,000 feet, where drones just have no place to be, so we\'ve got to do something. \n \n ""That\'s a registration process, some sort of tracking, some sort of electronic security - we\'ve got to do something about this."" \n \n Drone incidents at UK airports \n \n Image copyright BAA \n \n 17 April 2016 - A British Airways plane approaching Heathrow is believed to have hit a drone while in midair \n \n 28 November 2015 - The pilot of an A321 plane narrowly missed a drone hovering at 100ft above a runway at Gatwick Airport \n \n 30 September 2015 - A small drone helicopter passed within 30ft of the cockpit of an A319 plane while on the approach to Heathrow \n \n 22 September 2015 - A ""quadcopter-type drone"" missed the right-hand side of a B777 plane by about 25m while at 2,000ft after it left Heathrow Airport \n \n 13 September 2015 - A silver drone with a ""balloon-like"" centre missed an E170 aircraft by about 20m, while the plane was approaching London City Airport over the Thames \n \n 13 September 2015 - A drone flew over the top of a B737 aircraft while at 4,000ft, missing it by about 5m, shortly after it left Stansted \n \n 27 August 2015 - A DO328 aircraft flew within 50ft of a drone while approaching Manchester Airport at 2,800ft \n \n Source: The UK Airprox Board', ""Story highlights London police seek public's help in finding operator of drone that may have struck airliner \n \n No one was hurt and the plane wasn't damaged, but authorities worry about potential for catastrophe \n \n London (CNN) Did a drone hit an airliner trying to land at London's Heathrow Airport? \n \n The pilot of a British Airways flight certainly thinks so, and now authorities would like to find out who might have been behind the weekend incident. \n \n British Airways Flight BA727 from Geneva was approaching Heathrow on Sunday afternoon when what the pilot believed to be a drone struck the front of the aircraft, London Metropolitan Police said.

Already, the migrant trail was adapting, finding new ways to reach western Europe.', 'Refugees blazed a new pathway through Europe on Wednesday, with hundreds hiking through cornfields to reach welcoming Croatia even as others faced tear gas and water cannons from Hungarian police determined to turn them away. \n \n The contrasting scenes along the Serbian border highlighted both the make-or-break resolve of the asylum seekers and the growing friction facing Europe, which has failed to create a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx of economic migrants and war refugees from the Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n \n “We hit a stone and we flow around it,” said Arazak Dubal, 28, a computer programmer from Damascus, who had been on the road for 18 days. \n \n He and his three companions reached Belgrade only to discover on Facebook and WhatsApp that the Hungarian border was closed to refugees. \n \n “So I went to Google Maps, and here we are,” said Dubal, huffing in the hot afternoon as he trudged across the farm fields. \n \n \n \n \n \n A two-hour drive to the northeast — along Serbia’s frontier with Hungary — the route was slammed shut. \n \n Just steps from Hungary, thousands of people spent the night in the wet grass on the Serbian side of the border. Hours later, hundreds tried to punch through the cordon of razor wire and riot police massed near the Serbian border town of Horgos. \n \n But they ran headlong into security forces\xad who unleashed tear gas and pepper spray to drive them back. Some refugees were swatted by batons and crumpled to the ground in pain. \n \n [New threat on the refu\xadgee trail: land mines] \n \n “Open the door!” the refugees yelled as they hurled water bottles and debris at riot police. \n \n Nearby, children screamed for their missing parents. Water cannons sprayed crowds on the Serbian side, forcing refugees to retreat to a squalid squatters’ camp that took root just after Hungary closed the border Tuesday. \n \n There were no major injuries, but some refugees were treated by Serbian authorities for respiratory problems from the tear gas and at least one migrant had a leg injury, the Associated Press reported. \n \n It was the first major clash between security forces\xad and migrants since police used stun grenades to stop refugees from crossing into Macedonia from Greece almost a month ago. \n \n “We fled wars and violence and did not expect such brutality and inhumane treatment in Europe,” said Amir Hassan, who was drenched from a water cannon and tried to wash tear gas from his eyes, according to AP. \n \n “Shame on you Hungarians!” he shouted, pointing toward the Hungarian police. \n \n At the United Nations, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Hungary’s border crackdowns “unacceptable.” \n \n “All the countries have their domestic problems,” he said, “but since they are the people fleeing the wars and persecutions, then we must show our compassionate leadership.” \n \n Neighboring countries continued to heap scorn on Hungary’s decision to blocks its southern border. \n \n “Barbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it’s a threat,” complained Croatia’s prime minister, Zoran Milanovic, in a direct jab at the blockades by neighboring Hungary. \n \n Milanovic promised that refugees would be allowed to pass through his country. \n \n He told lawmakers in Zagreb that Croatia would “accept and direct” the migrants to transit the country — comments that rocketed through the social media networks used by the refugees and increased the march toward Croatia. \n \n [ The limbo of the no man’s land ] \n \n The river of migrants was swelling by the hour. \n \n By late afternoon, more than 600 migrants walked through fields and along small roads to cross from Serbia into Croatia, a European Union member, where officials set up posts to register names and details. \n \n Many traveled by bus from Macedonia and Hungary; others pulled up in taxis before crossing the border on foot and receiving a polite reception from authorities. \n \n “We want to keep them moving as quickly as possible,” said Zdravko Helic, a civil protection officer in Tovarnik. \n \n He was proud to add, “We haven’t had a single incident.” \n \n Saeed, 19, a student from Damascus, called Hungary’s treatment of the refugees “old-fashioned racism.” \n \n “We’re the first today,” said Dubal, the Syrian refugee. “There’ll be thousands tomorrow.” \n \n Afterward they were taken by bus to a refugee processing camp outside the capital, Zagreb, where they would be officially registered. \n \n What happens after Zagreb was uncertain. \n \n Croatian officials said they would probably allow the migrants to continue their journeys by bus and train to Slovenia, Austria, Germany and beyond. But it was only Croatia’s first day at the leading edge of the mass migration, and authorities were scrambling to coordinate their response with E.U. partners. \n \n “We will walk all the way to Germany if we have to,” said Mohammad, 28, who worked in a mobile phone store in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city. \n \n “Shop is gone, house is gone, some of family is gone,” he said. “So I will walk.” \n \n Like many in the migrant stream, he declined to give his last name out of fear of reprisals against relatives back home. \n \n The refugees had nothing good to say about Hungary. “Not nice at all,” said Abdullah, 24, from Aleppo, who smiled and waved at the Croatian police before they hustled him into a van. \n \n “See? Very good service,” he joked. \n \n Souad Mekhennet in Vienna, Gergo Saling and Jodi Hilton in Horgos, Serbia, and Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report. \n \n Read more: \n \n Germany’s enthusiasm for refugees might not last.

And as restrictions tighten, migrants are seeking other ways into Western Europe through Slovenia and Croatia, as well as through Hungary's border with Romania. Issues remain: Hungary’s poorer neighbors may be ill-equipped to handle the flow, and there are areas peppered with land mines, remnants of the Balkan Wars. While solutions are sought, thousands spent last night in a Vienna train station, per the Times, while at least 22 migrants drowned yesterday in the Aegean Sea, the Post notes—a sad repeat of a similar incident a couple of days earlier. Leaders of neighboring nations are scrambling to come up with their own plans for dealing with the influx, which is no small task: The EU border agency notes a head count of 500,000 migrants at EU nations' entry points so far in 2015; last year that number was around 280,000, the BBC reports. Many are refugees fleeing high-conflict areas such as Syria and Iraq, per the Washington Post, which adds there's a noted ""absence of a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx."" ""Barbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it's a threat,"" Croatia's PM says, per the Post, adding that Croatia would ""accept and direct"" migrants through his country. An Egyptian billionaire who says he wants ""to clear my conscience as a human being"" has come up with an even more creative stopgap for the Syrian refugees involved: hosting them on two available Greek islands, using a joint-stock company to accept donations, Bloomberg reports.

The two rounds that were fired sent passengers scattering in panic. The shot were heard by a special agent of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). The HSI office is about 150 feet from the shooting. \n \n The agent ran toward the gunfire, continued Miller, identified himself as a federal agent and ordered Moore to drop the gun. Moore turned toward the agent who fired, striking Moore in the upper body. At the same moment, Moore turned his own gun on himself and fired. Moore was dead at the scene. Inside a black suitcase next to where Moore was sitting, HSI, FBI and Houston PD found a black suitcase contains a Smith & Wesson AR15 assault weapon with a fully loaded magazine. \n \n In Moore\'s car, more .223 ammo for the weapon was found. Earlier in the day, Moore had posted on social media that he intended to commit a mass shooting today. A handwritten note found on Moore\'s body said he had changed his mind and wanted to kill himself. \n \n An autopsy will be conducted Friday. \n \n The terminal was closed immediately after the shooting. But later Thursday, parts of the terminal were reopened to passengers. The rest of the airport remained open after the shooting. \n \n Darian Ward, a spokeswoman for the Houston Airport System, said some passengers who were scheduled to leave from Terminal B were rerouted to other terminals. \n \n Dale Howard, of Tomball, was at the baggage handling area of the airport waiting for his sister to arrive on an incoming flight when he heard two shots fired from the floor above. A few seconds later, he said he heard three more shots. \n \n ""People were screaming. I knew exactly what it was \x97 gunfire,"" Howard said. \n \n Police from an adjacent station rushed in, and Howard said he directed them to the floor above. \n \n Greg Newburn, who was in the terminal waiting for a flight to Oklahoma City, said he was sitting in a cafe area when he heard two gunshots and after a pause, several more. \n \n ""It seemed like quite a few shots. Everyone was scrambling, running left and running right, turning tables up and hiding behind tables. Nobody knew what was happening. I couldn\'t tell where the shots were coming from,"" he said. \n \n Newburn, from Gainesville, Fla., said it took him a few seconds to realize that the shots had come from the ticketing area, near the security checkpoint.', 'Page 1 of 1 \n \n UPDATE: Houston police just released this portion of Carnell Marcus Moore\'s suicide note that they say was written on Hotel Derek stationery: \n \n \n \n ""Here in the last hour, I yield to mercy when this could have turned bad. Jehovah found a path to my heart, that love would conquer anger. The monster within me was getting stronger and while I could not save myself I could spare others. [redacted] Peace is within sight. I ask that authorities handle my disposal – Carnell Marcus Moore"" \n \n ________ \n \n A Beaumont man shot and killed Thursday at Houston\'s George Bush Intercontinental Airport was a reserved person of few words, neighbors said. \n \n But 29-year-old Carnell Marcus Moore wrote of death on his Facebook page earlier Thursday and, according to Houston police, apparently left a suicide note that said he was having trouble controlling his ""monster inside."" \n \n Moore was killed in gunfire about 1:35 p.m. near a Terminal B ticket counter. It is unclear who fired the fatal shot. \n \n HPD spokesman Kese Smith said an armed male in his early 30s entered the airport and fired at least once into the ceiling just inside the doors of the terminal\'s pre-security departure area. \n \n Hearing the gunfire, a Homeland Security Investigations agent came out of his office and confronted Moore, ordering him to put down the gun, Smith said. \n \n When Moore refused the command, the officer pulled out his weapon and the man turned toward him, Smith said. \n \n The agent fired once, and Moore shot himself - apparently at the same time, according to Smith. Moore died at the scene. No one else was injured. \n \n Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, said an autopsy was expected to be performed on Friday. \n \n Hours after the shooting, officers were at Moore\'s home in Beaumont, carrying out computer equipment, a neighbor said. \n \n Marietta Kidd said she looked out a window toward the duplex where Moore lived and counted seven unmarked cars in her parking lot about the time school let out on Thursday. Kidd said her father owns the home and that her sister is Moore\'s neighbor. \n \n Kidd, who owns a beauty salon on the same street where Moore lived, said he had been in the duplex for several years and that he never talked much. \n \n Moore spoke of death on his Facebook page three times since Wednesday. \n \n \'When I go to meet God\' \n \n The first status update was posted nearly 24 hours before he was killed. ""I recently had the chance of staring death in the face, and she was beautiful,"" he wrote at 1:26 p.m. Wednesday. \n \n About 12:45 a.m. Thursday, he proclaimed that ""This Life Will Crash Tomorrow!"" \n \n And about 12:42 p.m., he posted: ""45 minutes and 59 seconds in God\'s Shadow and Time Stops."" \n \n His timeline also includes a video of a strained and sorrowful spoken word piece called ""When I go to meet God."" \n \n The lyrics include: ""What makes a mother\'s son decide that death is better than tomorrow?"" and ""This is not a life worth living. I already ruined it."" \n \n According to his Facebook profile, Beaumont was Moore\'s hometown, though he finished high school in a Georgia community south of Atlanta. He graduated from the heating, ventilation and air conditioning program at the Lamar Institute of Technology. \n \n \'He was a good guy\' \n \n Colleagues remembered Moore as an affable and kind man. \n \n ""He was a friendly guy who talked to everybody,"" said Tim Knobloch, 29, one of Moore\'s tech school classmates in 2004 and later his co-worker at a Beaumont air conditioning company. ""He was a good guy."" \n \n The shooting scene was chaotic, passengers and employees reported. \n \n Tina Gellinger, a 40-year-old Kansan who went outside between flights, was coming into Terminal B when she heard shouts to ""run!"" \n \n She and others scrambled toward elevators and hid behind walls as gunfire rang out. \n \n Nearby at the McDonald\'s in the food court, employee Tiffany Rigmaiden heard two shots, then shouting, then three more shots. The 23-year-old said a Transportation Security Administration agent running by told her and other workers to get down. Instead, they escaped through a back door and took an elevator to a lower floor. \n \n According to Houston Airport System spokeswoman Darian Ward, Houston police and the FBI ""interviewed quite a few people."" She added that there was no ""visible damage"" to the facility. \n \n The incident also interrupted flights. \n \n Terminal B, where mostly smaller, regional jets land and take off, was shut down for hours. Incoming passengers were rerouted to enter through terminals C and E. At one point, a ground stop prevented planes from landing at Terminal B. \n \n Mike Glenn and Cindy George contributed to this report. Guiseppe Barranco reported from Beaumont.', 'The chemicals BP is now relying on to break up the steady flow of leaking oil from deep below the Gulf of Mexico could create a new set of environmental problems. \n \n Even if the materials, called dispersants, are effective, BP has already bought up more than a third of the world’s supply. If the leak from 5,000 feet beneath the surface continues for weeks, or months, that stockpile could run out. \n \n On Thursday BP began using the chemical compounds to dissolve the crude oil, both on the surface and deep below, deploying an estimated 100,000 gallons. Dispersing the oil is considered one of the best ways to protect birds and keep the slick from making landfall. But the dispersants contain harmful toxins of their own and can concentrate leftover oil toxins in the water, where they can kill fish and migrate great distances. \n \n The exact makeup of the dispersants is kept secret under competitive trade laws, but a worker safety sheet for one product, called Corexit, says it includes 2-butoxyethanol, a compound associated with headaches, vomiting and reproductive problems at high doses. \n \n “There is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil,” said Richard Charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for Marine Programs for Defenders of Wildlife and is chairman of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council. “It’s a trade-off – you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t -- of trying to minimize the damage coming to shore, but in so doing you may be more seriously damaging the ecosystem offshore.” \n \n BP did not respond to requests for comment for this article. \n \n Dispersants are mixtures of solvents, surfactants and other additives that break up the surface tension of an oil slick and make oil more soluble in water, according to a paper published by the National Academy of Sciences. They are spread over or in the water in very low concentration – a single gallon may cover several acres. \n \n Once they are dispersed, the tiny droplets of oil are more likely to sink or remain suspended in deep water rather than floating to the surface and collecting in a continuous slick. Dispersed oil can spread quickly in three directions instead of two and is more easily dissipated by waves and turbulence that break it up further and help many of its most toxic hydrocarbons evaporate. \n \n But the dispersed oil can also collect on the seabed, where it becomes food for microscopic organisms at the bottom of the food chain and eventually winds up in shellfish and other organisms. The evaporation process can also concentrate the toxic compounds left behind, particularly oil-derived compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. \n \n According to a 2005 National Academy of Sciences report, the dispersants and the oil they leave behind can kill fish eggs. A study of oil dispersal in Coos Bay, Ore. found that PAH accumulated in mussels, the Academy’s paper noted. Another study examining fish health after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 found that PAHs affected the developing hearts of Pacific herring and pink salmon embryos. The research suggests the dispersal of the oil that’s leaking in the Gulf could affect the seafood industry there. \n \n “One of the most difficult decisions that oil spill responders and natural resource managers face during a spill is evaluating the trade-offs associated with dispersant use,” said the Academy report, titled Oil Spill Dispersants, Efficacy and Effects. “There is insufficient understanding of the fate of dispersed oil in aquatic ecosystems.” \n \n A version of Corexit was widely used after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill and, according to a literature review performed by the group the Alaska Community Action on Toxics, was later linked with health impacts in people including respiratory, nervous system, liver, kidney and blood disorders. But the Academy report makes clear that the dispersants used today are less toxic than those used a decade ago. \n \n “There is a certain amount of toxicity,” said Robin Rorick, director of marine and security operations at the American Petroleum Institute. “We view dispersant use as a tool in a toolbox. It’s a function of conducting a net environmental benefit analysis and determining the best bang for your buck.” \n \n Charter, the marine expert, cautioned the dispersants should be carefully considered for the right reasons. \n \n “Right now there is a headlong rush to get this oil out of sight out of mind,” Charter said. “You can throw every resource we have at this spill. You can call out the Marine Corps and the National Guard. This is so big that it is unlikely that any amount of response is going to make much of a dent in the impacts. It’s going to be mostly watching it happen.” \n \n Ryan Knutson contributed to this report']",3,"– The gunman who was killed—possibly by his own hand—at a Houston airport yesterday left a number of chilling posts on Facebook the day before, prompting CBS News to suggest he was planning a mass shooting.

On Monday, two days after her 18th birthday, she was sentenced to 13 years in prison. ""It was a huge eye-opener for us,"" Pontecorvo says of the case, heard in Kings County Superior Court. ""We were able to get these girls back home and get them the help they needed … but these pimps are ruining these kids' lives at an early age."" Pimps like Almario, he adds, per UPI, ""are great at locating kids with low self-esteem and trying to be their friend, and then it obviously changes."" For example, Almario once sent threatening emails to the mother of one of her victims who was simply looking for her daughter, reports the AP. Pontecorvo explains the girls Almario targeted ""would run away for weekends or work a couple of nights."" (A teen says she was forced to have sex with 1,000 men at this hotel.)"
20,"['That landing is scheduled for 1:31 a.m., and officials said they could know almost immediately if the rover was safely on the ground. That tracking would come from the Odyssey orbiter circling Mars, if the spacecraft is able to get to the right location at the right time. \n \n If not, the waiting time for a final answer on whether the rover was safely on the surface could range from two to eight hours. If no signal arrives from Curiosity via three Mars orbiters and the Deep Space Network after 18 hours, NASA officials said, then they would start to worry about its safety. \n \n The final descent has been pre-programmed and the army of engineers and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Lab’s Mission Control have no control over it. “Our position will be identical to anyone at home,” said Adam Steltzner, lead of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) team. “We’re all along for the ride.” \n \n Speaking for the team as a whole, Steltzner said they were “Rationally confident, emotionally terrified and ready for EDL.” \n \n Because the rover is so much larger, more complicated and more ambitious than earlier models, it has to land in a new and far more hazardous way. The landing, which could never be tested in full on Earth, includes a hovering rocket stage, a kind of sky crane, to lower it to the ground. NASA’s chief scientist John Grunsfeld has said that because of that heightened landing difficulty, in addition to the unprecedented sophistication of the instruments on board, Curiosity is “the most important NASA mission of the decade.” \n \n Worldwide spectacle \n \n The Curiosity landing is shaping up to be an international spectacle. Formal “landing” parties have been scheduled from South Australia to Rome, from Israel to Crete; and in the United States from Atlanta to Seattle, Milwaukee to Honolulu. \n \n NASA also has helped organize a landing gathering in New York’s Times Square, which will feature a large screen that will beam the streaming news from atop a building and high above the crowd. \n \n Reaching, orbiting and landing on Mars is notoriously hard. In addition to the European Space Agency, nations including the United States, the former Soviet Union, Russia, the European Space Agency, China and Japan have sent missions to Mars since the late 1960s, but only about one-third of them have succeeded. \n \n The United States is the only nation to land a vehicle on Mars and complete its mission, having done it six out of seven tries.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The boys can be seen introducing themselves next to a diver in a wetsuit \n \n A new video has been released of the 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a Thai cave, in which they say they are in good health. \n \n Smiling and at times laughing, they introduce themselves one by one. \n \n They were found on Monday after nine days trapped deep in the cave by rising water, and have since received food and medical treatment. \n \n But their rescue may take months as they must either be taught to dive or wait for the water to recede. \n \n The concern is that the rainy season has only just begun, so water levels in the Tham Luang cave will almost certainly continue to rise. \n \n The video posted on the Thai Navy special forces Facebook page shows the team draped in foil blankets to keep them warm. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption The boys all give their names, and a traditional Thai greeting \n \n Lit by torches and with divers sitting alongside, they each give their name and the traditional ""wai"" greeting, putting their palms together. \n \n Two other videos show the group having some light scratches treated by a military doctor.

So they were seriously considering keeping the boys there for the full four or five months of the rainy season, he added. \n \n Some of the route involves squeezing through tight gaps underwater. In parts it is too narrow to wear an oxygen tank and the exits are not visible, so it would be easy for a child to panic. \n \n However, other Thai officials say they may need to bring the boys out quickly if water levels rise. Weather forecasts for the area are being closely monitored for heavy rain which could trigger further flooding. \n \n What are the trapped group having to endure? \n \n Before they were found, they would have lived in total darkness once any torch batteries had expired. \n \n However, the three basic conditions for survival were met: \n \n The temperature in the cave is thought to be around 26C (79F) so hypothermia was not an issue \n \n There was sufficient oxygen because air enters through porous limestone or cracks in the rocks. \n \n They had drinkable water \n \n Oxygen may yet become a problem should the water level rise and the air pocket they are in get smaller. \n \n Unknown factors include the possibility of dangerous animals like snakes in the cave or of contamination from bat droppings. \n \n What rescue efforts are being made? \n \n Rescuers are trying to work out how best to bring them all to safety, with officials stressing they do not intend to take any risks with the boys\' safety. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Families have been shown new footage of the 12 boys and their coach stuck in a cave in Thailand. \n \n At a news conference, officials said no rescue attempt would be made on Wednesday but conditions were perfect for a rehearsal. \n \n Water continues to be pumped out of the cave complex and officials have said they are confident they have been able to stop more water getting into the chamber the boys are in. \n \n Emergency teams are also trying to install a phone line so the group can talk to their families but attempts to do so failed on Tuesday. \n \n Outside the cave, medics are staging rehearsals in case the group can be brought out soon. \n \n Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into - and out of - the cave. \n \n How did the group get trapped? \n \n The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave in northern Chiang Rai province when it was dry and that sudden heavy rains blocked the exit. \n \n It is thought they could at first move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access. \n \n How were they found? \n \n They were finally reached by two British rescue divers late on Monday, nine days after they entered the caves. \n \n They were huddled on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment divers discover the missing boys \n \n The video of that first contact was also posted on Facebook by Thai navy special forces. \n \n The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 are there and they are very hungry. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Diver Ben Reymenants is assisting with the rescue mission and says none of the boys can swim']",2,"– The Curiosity rover landed safely on Mars early this morning, prompting whoops of joy and relief in NASA's mission control center, reports the New York Times. The rover quickly beamed back a picture of its own shadow cast on the surface of the Red Planet. ""Touchdown confirmed. We are safe on the surface of Mars!"" the team read out after receiving signals from the rover. After a journey of 354 million miles, the rover, which is much bigger and more complex than previous models, had to land in a new way that could never be fully tested on Earth, leading to what control room staff described as ""seven minutes of terror"" before confirmation was received, notes the Washington Post. As earlier reported, the spacecraft ferrying it had to rely on a supersonic parachute to slow it from 13,200mph to about 1.7mph; with seconds to go, the rover was then lowered to the surface using three nylon tethers and retro rockets."

22,"['“Now, this is real simple,” President Obama told a crowd at Prince George’s Community College, in Maryland, in late September. “It’s a Website where you can compare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak … same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on, and you start looking, and here are all the options.” \n \n As we all now know, the bug-infested Website healthcare.gov turned out to be anything but “real simple.” After the site’s disastrous October 1 launch, the administration organized a frantic rescue effort shepherded by Jeffrey Zients, who is to become Obama’s chief economic adviser in January, and on December 17, the administration tapped Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene to lead the effort to build out the rest of the Website. The site is working better (but as of this writing still not perfectly) for consumers, though the complications it has unleashed for President Obama will be even harder to fix. The New York Times called the broken Website a “crisis that suddenly threatened his presidency,” and according to a CBS News poll, Obama’s job-approval rating has plunged to an all-time low. Americans’ approval of the Affordable Care Act has also dropped to its lowest level since CBS News began polling support for the law. \n \n The story of how the Obama administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agencies tasked with implementing the Affordable Care Act got it so wrong is still unfolding. Much of the blame has to fall on an insular White House that didn’t want to hear about problems, and another chunk has to land on CMS, which instead of hiring a systems integrator, whose job it would have been to ensure that all the processes feeding into healthcare.gov worked together, kept that role for itself. As anyone who has worked with the federal government on such projects knows, it is utterly inept when it comes to technology. “The government continues to struggle with how best to acquire the expertise to integrate technology,” says Stan Soloway, the C.E.O. of the Professional Services Council, which represents contractors who work with the government. Soloway has a scary stat, which is that of the 80,000 information-technology workers in the federal government, for every one person under 30, there are 10 people over 50. \n \n That lack of expertise explains why in building healthcare.gov, the government turned to industry contractors; in particular, to CGI Federal, a subsidiary of CGI Group, a Canadian company. To those uninitiated in the dark art of government contracting, it seems scandalous that CGI, a company most Americans had never heard of, a company that is not located in Silicon Valley (where President Obama has plenty of Internet superstar friends who could have formed a dazzling brain trust to implement his signature legislation) but rather in Montreal, could be chosen as the lead contractor for the administration’s most important initiative. While right-wing news outlets have focused on the possible relationship between Toni Townes-Whitley, senior vice president for civilian-agency programs at CGI Federal, and Michelle Obama, both of whom were 1985 Princeton graduates, CGI’s selection is probably more an example of a dysfunctional system than it is a scandal. “A lot of the companies in Silicon Valley don’t do business with the government at that level [the level required for federal contracting],” explains Soloway. “It is very burdensome, and the rules make it very unattractive.” Indeed, government contractors have to meet a whole host of requirements contained in a foot-thick book, including cost accounting and excessive auditing, to prove that they are not profiting too much off the American taxpayer. Hence, there tends to be a relatively small, specialized group of companies that compete for this work, even on such critical matters as healthcare.gov. \n \n In this context, the selection of CGI, which has had a long relationship with the U.S. government through the companies it has acquired—among other projects, CGI also ran recovery.gov, the Website for all data related to the Recovery Act—doesn’t seem so odd. Back in 2007, CGI was one of 16 companies given an umbrella contract to do unspecified systems work for CMS. These so-called indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, or ID/IQ, contracts exist throughout the federal government. Companies compete to be on the list, and then when a specific task arises, they compete again to be awarded that task; but because the list of competitors is predetermined, the process is shorter. When the Obama administration selected a main contractor for healthcare.gov, they decided to use the prequalified contractors, rather than starting afresh, in order to save time, according to Bloomberg. CGI was chosen as the lead contractor for the Website over three other bidders: IBM, QSSI, and Computer Sciences Corporation. According to congressional testimony, CGI stands to be paid $292 million for its work on healthcare.gov. \n \n CGI’s lack of visibility before healthcare.gov wasn’t a reflection of the size of the company or how much work it does. With a market value of roughly $11.6 billion, CGI, after the decline of BlackBerry maker RIM, boasts of being Canada’s biggest technology company. (All figures in this story are in Canadian dollars; one U.S. dollar is worth about 1.07 Canadian dollars at the present time.) In truth, companies like CGI are more body shops than true technology companies, and the projects they take on require a lot of grunt work by a lot of low-level employees. CGI employs almost 70,000 people, who are embedded in businesses and governments around the globe. Its U.S. clients have included the military, the F.B.I., Pennsylvania’s Medicaid Medical Assistance program, and at least 40 state governments. \n \n CGI is short for Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique, or Consultants to Government and Industry. It was founded back in 1976 by two Québécois, Serge Godin and Andre Imbeau. The publicity-shy Godin, now 63 and still active as the company’s chairman, became a billionaire this year, according to Slate, which called him a “classic tortoise” who had built his fortune with a “reliable, and more patient, business strategy than stumbling on the right tech at the right time.” He’s received numerous awards and honorary titles, including being inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, and he is a major owner of harness-racing horses. His daughter, Julie Godin, is the company’s executive in charge of human relations, and her father’s presumptive heir. \n \n CGI has been a big stock-market success. According to the Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail, CGI’s stock has risen an average of 25 percent annually for the last 25 years. At its peak in November, the stock was up almost 70 percent in 2013, and the problems of healthcare.gov seemed to be having no discernible impact. Slate said that that’s because healthcare.gov is such a small part of its business. At any rate, CGI just reported revenues of $10.1 billion in its fiscal year ended in September 2013, up more than 100 percent from a year ago. \n \n Even before healthcare.gov, CGI was embroiled in its share of controversy about its work, from problems with Ontario’s online medical registry to difficulties with the Department of Taxation’s collection system in Hawaii. As CGI worked on healthcare.gov, government officials were frustrated with the company for missing deadlines, and Michelle Snyder, CMS’s chief operating officer, told colleagues, “If we could fire them, we would,” according to The New York Times. Both Marilyn Tavenner, CMS administrator, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, testified in congressional hearings that CGI didn’t meet expectations. A CGI spokesperson says, “as a matter of policy, we do not discuss the specifics of our ongoing client projects.” \n \n On Wall Street, there’s an entirely different sort of controversy brewing about CGI. Several smart investors—including well-known short-seller Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates—are betting against CGI, or shorting its shares, not because of the quality of its work but because of questions about its earnings. In September, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane downgraded CGI to a rare “sell” rating, citing quality-of-earnings questions. What he and others point out is that a number of questionable accounting tactics could be creating the illusion that CGI’s business is far more successful than it actually is. After the news broke in Newsweek that Chanos was shorting CGI, its stock fell more than 12 percent, although it’s begun to climb again. \n \n CGI is what’s known as a “roll-up,” meaning that it was built by acquiring other businesses, or rolling them up. Indeed, since its founding in 1976, CGI has acquired more than 70 businesses. (“Please stand up if you’ve ever been acquired,” Godin asked a crowd at a company gathering last February, according to the Globe and Mail. Almost everyone in the room stood up.) In the U.S., CGI built its business with the 2004 purchase of American Management Systems, based in Arlington, Virginia, and the $1.1 billion 2010 purchase of Stanley Inc., another Arlington, Virginia–based company. Stanley’s biggest customer was the U.S. Army, and the Stanley deal, according to Cormark Securities analyst Richard Tse, was instrumental in entrenching CGI with the government. “They are quite embedded,” he told the Globe and Mail. “Stanley was an entity that was really effectively managing many of the back-office systems for government and military.” Most recently, CGI bought Logica, a management-consultancy company headquartered in the United Kingdom.', ""CGI Federal, the company responsible for building the problem-plagued Web site for the Affordable Care Act, won the job because of what federal officials deemed a “technically superior” proposal, according to government documents and people familiar with the decision. \n \n Not considered in the 2011 selection process was the history of numerous executives at CGI Federal, who had come from another company that had mishandled at least 20 other government \xadinformation technology projects more than a decade ago. But federal officials were not required to examine that long-term track record, which included a highly publicized failure to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. \n \n By 2011, CGI Federal already had been cleared to do government work at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency overseeing the rollout of the new health-care law. \n \n The company had been included in a pool of pre-screened, approved contractors in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration, and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. It was at that earlier time that the problems at American Management Systems, the Fairfax County IT contractor acquired by CGI, would have figured into the assessment of CGI Federal, contracting experts say. \n \n In hindsight, one former CMS official said, the AMS record “could well have knocked [CGI Federal] out of the competition, and probably should have.” \n \n View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points. \n \n In light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site, critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract, and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration. \n \n But a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics. \n \n Career officials at CMS, working out of an obscure Baltimore-based contracting office, focused in 2011 on the proposals submitted by four bidders, examining technical competency and cost while giving relatively little attention to past performance. Since 2007, CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract, worth several hundred million dollars. \n \n The review of CGI Federal concluded there was “no evidence of performance risk,” according to a CMS document, portions of which were read to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the contracting process. \n \n CGI Federal won the $93 million contract, now worth $293 million, in September 2011. \n \n At the time of the earlier selection process in 2007, CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting. It had grown out of CGI Group’s acquisition in 2004 of AMS, which had a recent history of troubled projects, including a Philadelphia school computer system that sent paychecks to dead people and a Mississippi tax system so dysfunctional that a jury awarded a $474 million verdict against the firm. \n \n Three former CMS officials said in recent interviews that the AMS problems should have raised red flags. \n \n “Should CMS have recognized that ‘Okay, here’s CGI Federal. It’s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday’?” asked one former CMS official familiar with the contracting process who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. “Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball.’’ \n \n Tasha Bradley, a CMS spokeswoman, said in a statement that the agency “adheres by a long- \n \n established contracting process where expert, career contracting officials evaluate and award contracts based on criteria outlined in the contract solicitation, including past performance, technical expertise and proposed contract value.” \n \n CMS declined to comment on specific questions about how closely CGI Federal’s past performance was evaluated and whether that review looked at AMS. \n \n Former AMS executives have defended that company’s performance, and CGI officials have rejected any comparison with AMS’s earlier failures. \n \n CGI Federal has also defended its work on HealthCare.gov, despite an October launch that White House officials have acknowledged was disastrous. Federal officials have faulted the company’s performance, saying it missed deadlines, understaffed the job and overstated its progress. \n \n People familiar with the project have said it was also hampered by administration mismanagement, fierce Republican opposition and political sensitivities that delayed policy and regulatory decisions. \n \n The federal online marketplace that is selling health plans in 36 states under the 2010 health-care law has been functioning better in recent weeks, but officials are still working to fix lingering problems, including errors in enrollment records sent to insurance companies. CGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project, writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system. \n \n Linda Odorisio, CGI’s vice president for global communications, said the company “continues to work closely with CMS and all of its vendor partners to deliver continuous enhancements in system performance and the user experience” on the Web site. \n \n She added that CGI Federal “contributed to the significant improvements made to the system over the last two months, resulting in more than half a million Americans enrolling in just the first three weeks of December.” \n \n Umbrella contract \n \n In December 2006, CMS put out a request for proposals. The agency said it was seeking “world-class IT services” to improve and maintain the massive systems that run Medicare and Medicaid, according to contracting documents. Thirty-one bidders responded, including CGI Federal. \n \n CMS used a procurement method that has become increasingly common over the past decade. The agency first awarded an umbrella contract to a group of firms, and those firms were then eligible to bid on future IT work. Experts say this saves the government time because it shortens the subsequent bid process. \n \n In evaluating the bids, CMS was to scrutinize each company’s performance on previous contracts, according to an internal agency document obtained by The Post. The document described a “risk assessment” of cost control, on-time delivery and other factors. \n \n Federal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150,000, with limited exceptions. Federal regulations also say CMS should have considered the record of “predecessor companies,” such as AMS. Several former officials familiar with the 2007 selection said no concerns about CGI Federal were raised inside the agency. \n \n AMS projects had run into trouble at the federal level and in at least 12 states, according to government audit reports, interviews and news accounts. The purchase of AMS was CGI’s entree into the U.S. government market, and AMS executives flocked to CGI Federal. Today, more than 100 former AMS employees are senior executives or consultants working for CGI in the Washington area. \n \n One former CMS official said the agency especially should have examined the most publicized AMS failure, an effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. AMS was fired in 2001 by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board after going $60 million over budget, writing computer code that turned out to be useless and never delivering a workable system, according to government reports. \n \n AMS had settled lawsuits arising from the project in 2003. “That should have stood out,’’ the former official said. \n \n CGI Federal was ultimately chosen for an umbrella contract, worth up to $4 billion in future work, along with 15 other firms, including Lockheed Martin and IBM. \n \n While it is unclear whether agency officials examined the AMS track record, former CMS officials said it probably would not have made much difference, because past performance has long been an overlooked component of federal contracting. \n \n Deadline pressure \n \n In the summer of 2011, the Obama administration was racing to figure out who would build the Affordable Care Act’s all-important Web site. “Time is of the essence,” said an internal CMS draft request for proposals, dated June 24, 2011. \n \n With deadlines looming, officials limited the bidders to the winners of the 2007 umbrella contract. “There was very great time pressure,” recalled a former CMS official familiar with the process. “The feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.’’ \n \n Four firms applied: IBM, Computer Sciences Corp., Quality Software Services and CGI Federal. \n \n As is tradition, the selection process was strictly sheltered from political considerations and political appointees at CMS or elsewhere in the administration, according to numerous former and current CMS employees. \n \n “I deliberately stayed out of contracting,’’ said Leslie Norwalk, the agency’s acting administrator under President George W. Bush. “If that had changed, I would have heard rumblings.’’ \n \n Agency documents show that a career contracting officer, in the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, was in charge of awarding the contract for the Web site. The selection process focused on bidders’ business and technical proposals, which described the proposed cost, hardware and software required, proposed infrastructure design, security requirements, and key personnel. \n \n The companies’ past performance was not a priority. The CMS document listed it as the second least important of seven technical evaluation factors. And the review would look only at past work under the 2007 umbrella contract, the document said. \n \n While the review found no performance risk for CGI Federal, agency officials had not always been satisfied with the company’s work. In 2010, CMS rejected CGI Federal’s bid under the umbrella contract to perform work on four health IT systems, in part citing unspecified performance issues in carrying out an earlier contract, according to a Government Accountability Office ruling. CGI Federal protested the CMS decision, but the GAO upheld it. \n \n And the review did not take into account problems that several other CGI projects had encountered, including years of delay and system failures on a state computer system in Hawaii. State auditors in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for those issues. \n \n CGI says its overall work is high-quality and nearly always on time and on budget, and the company has also had many successes. In the past two years, CGI Federal has been awarded contracts with at least 25 federal agencies. \n \n Documents and interviews show that CGI Federal was selected because of what was deemed to be the company’s technical prowess, even though the price of the firm’s proposal was higher than that of at least of one competitor.""]",2,"– It turns out there were even more reasons the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shouldn't have picked the free-wheeling and allegedly shady CGI Federal to build HealthCare.gov. When CGI was vetted back in 2007, it didn't have any obvious black marks on its record, the Washington Post explains. But CGI is a ""roll-up"" company formed by acquiring other companies—one of which, American Management Systems, was one giant black mark. AMS projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level, including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits. The company went $60 million over budget on that one, yet produced nothing useful. More than 100 AMS alumni are now CGI executives or consultants. ""Should CMS have recognized that ‘OK, here’s CGI Federal. It’s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday’?"" asked one ex-CMS official. ""Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball."" But it didn't come up in 2007, and CMS never re-vetted the company, the Post's review of internal documents reveals. On the bright side, the review also reveals that the decision was politics-free, made purely because officials considered CMS' bid ""technically superior."" Vanity Fair, meanwhile, has an in-depth piece today on what many suspect is an accounting scandal brewing at CGI. It looks a lot like the company is using its acquisitions to mask financial problems, a quasi-legal practice known as creating a ""cookie jar."""

She also gave a bruising interview to the New York Daily News. \n \n Tragic: Julia Roberts\' half-sister Nancy Motes killed herself in a desperate attempt to destroy the actress\' career and scupper her chances of winning an Oscar at this year\'s Academy Awards, Conner Dilbeck, pictured, has claimed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline \n \n Busy woman: Roberts has been working the awards circuit for her turn in August: Osage County, which she did here on January 18 while attending the Screen Actors Guild Awards \n \n Plea: Conner wrote about his brother\'s fiance and Nancy\'s troubles with Julia Roberts on his Facebook page along with a photo of when John Dilbeck proposed \n \n According to Page Six, the Hollywood star was \'mortified\' by the \'embarrassing\' stories and wondered if her cash-strapped sister had betrayed her by selling the juicy details to the UK tabloid for money. \n \n \n \n It\'s not clear if Nancy was in fact paid by The Sun for the interview. \n \n However, Conner told MailOnline Julia inflicted \'pure cruelty\' on her sister and Nancy\'s suicide letter was a desperate attempt to expose the alleged treatment. \n \n And a friend and neighbor of Nancy Motes told MailOnline that her death was \'not a Philip Seymour Hoffman thing\' but a planned suicide. \n \n \n \n Conner claimed the note is eight pages long - not five as had been thought - and Julia is said to be \'terrified\' about it coming out. \n \n Conner also revealed that John Dilbeck was overcome by the \'horror\' of seeing his fiance\'s lifeless body in the bath. \n \n In a Facebook post Conner wrote: \'Nancy wanted the Truth to come out and she was Willing to Die to get her point across.\' \n \n Conner, 40, lived with Nancy and John in their apartment in Santa Monica, California for years, during which time he saw their relationship blossom. \n \n But the dark side was that he claimed it gave him a front row seat to the he mistreatment he claims Nancy suffered at the hands of Julia. \n \n Watch the full interview on Inside Edition \n \n \n \n \n \n Emotional: Nancy Motes appeared to post aggressive messages onto her Twitter account in the weeks prior to her tragic death apparently attacking her half-sister Julia Roberts \n \n Conner said: \'I have spent enough time with Nancy and I know enough about her that I can say from first hand experience a lot of things that have happened.\' \n \n He added: \'The truth is in the eight pages of her suicide letter.\' \n \n In a series of furious posts on Facebook, Conner railed against Julia and squarely blamed her for the tragedy. \n \n He wrote: \'I am posting this as a plea to everyone to Pray for my Brother John. \n \n \'His lovely Fiancé, Nancy Motes, was driven to Take her Life yesterday because of the Pure Cruelty of her Sister, Julia Roberts (yes Ms. Pretty Woman herself), that has done everything in her power to Ruin her and my brothers lives. \n \n \'He is overwhelmed by this horrible event and all the Turmoil Julia has subjected them too.\' Speaking to MailOnline, Conner said that after his brother found his fiance\'s body last Sunday he called the police and then called his family in distress. Breaking into tears, he said: \'The one thing that has made it more emotional for our family than anything else is to think of the horror of my brother having to walk in their and find his dead love in the water and nothing he could do about it and how she was driven to do this.\' \n \n Oscars: Nancy Motes killed herself to scupper her sister\'s Oscar chances, it has been claimed. Roberts, left, stars in the film with Meryl Streep, center In the months before her death, Nancy took aim at her famous sister on Twitter and one particular tweet apparently gives weight to the claim that she was plotting to hurt the Notting Hill star in some way. Nancy\'s death hasn\'t officially been ruled a suicide as a toxicology report has not been completed but her the family said in a statement that she died of \'an apparent drug overdose.\' In December, an emotional Nancy mysteriously tweeted, apparently about Julia: \'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You\'re going to LOVE what\'s coming! FYI-You\'re an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.\' \n \n Conner\'s account comes after John Fraschetti, who also knows Nancy\'s grieving fiancé, claimed the family of the Oscar winner were now \'crying crocodile tears\' over the former Glee production worker\'s death. He said they are only interested in manipulating public opinion after her suicide, but during her life, \'drove her to death.\' Making the incendiary comments Tuesday outside Nancy and Dilbeck\'s home, Fraschetti said Nancy spiraled into depression after Betty Lou Motes, the mother she and Roberts shared, \'rejected\' her six months ago - and that she \'just couldn\'t handle it anymore\'. \'And then you get the actress woman who is pretending to grieve but she didn\'t want to deal with Nancy and made her f***ing miserable.\' Nancy Motes was found dead on Sunday in a bathtub filled with water with prescription and \'illegal drugs\' near her in an apparent suicide. Fraschetti claims to have seen the letter she left behind. \n \n Fraschetti, who has known Dilbeck since he was 13, said that since her death, her family have been careful to mold a favorable public reaction. \'They are crying crocodile tears. They have taken control of this situation, but they never cared of her when she was alive,\' said Fraschetti. Fraschetti said that Nancy, \'couldn\'t stand the rejection of her mom, who in the last six months had cut her off entirely.\' Upset: Julia Roberts\' mother Betty Lou Motes is seen leaving her home in Los Angeles looking frail and upset Tuesday afternoon Cut-off: Nancy Motes is pictured in this photo with Julia Roberts when the Oscar winning actress was around 22 years old \n \n \'It hurt her that none of her family wanted to be with her. She had a miserable Christmas, truly awful, and I think she just couldn\'t handle it anymore.\' \n \n Fraschetti admitted that Nancy\'s well-documented problems with drugs and her weight had caused divisions, but claimed that to cut her off was unforgivable. \n \n \'They didn’t care when she was alive. She was a handful, and yes she had her problems, but there’s a way to deal with your relatives,\' said an angry Fraschetti. \n \n Nancy\'s suicide note also reveals the true depths of depression that her family\'s rejection had sent her to. \n \n \'It read about how much she loved and cared for her fiancé and how happy he made her, but it also said how unhappy and depressed her family made her and how she couldn’t cope anymore,\' said Fraschetti, who said that fiancé, Dilbeck, is grief stricken by Nancy\'s death and can\'t face the media. \n \n Indicating that the suicide note goes into detail about how hurt she felt by being ignored, Fraschetti said that Roberts and her family even put pressure on Dilbeck to delete tweets. \n \n But, it was revealed last night that Nancy had apparently tweeted a string of vicious messages aimed at her Oscar winning sister, including \'Just so you all know ""America\'s Sweetheart"" is a B****!!\' on January 20. \n \n That and others were indeed deleted overnight. \n \n \n \n Friend: John Fraschetti has known Nancy Motes\' fiance John Dilbeck since he was 13 and says that Julia Roberts and her family cutting off Nancy caused her suicide \n \n \'We\'ve got a person who is grieving so much, but then there is the other so called family who are grieving, so to speak, who want to see as little grief as possible for them,\' said Fraschetti. \n \n \'It\'s the rich versus the poor, the fake versus the real, he\'s the one who\'s in agony, he\'s the one that\'s genuine.\' \n \n And in an apparent confirmation that she did indeed commit suicide, Fraschetti said that her death was planned, but that she didn\'t use heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman. \n \n She wasn’t into heroin, as far as I was aware. It’s not like her or John were heroin addicts. Come on, it’s ridiculous. \n \n ‘I wouldn’t read too much into where she did it, it wasn’t in some drug den. She was dog sitting, and I imagine she did this, so she didn’t have to do it at home and let John find her.\' \n \n And this afternoon, Julia Roberts\' grief-stricken mother looked frail and visibly shaken as she visited the Oscar-winner following the apparent suicide death of her younger daughter, Nancy Motes. \n \n \n \n Dressed in a tartan hat and black jacket, Betty Lou Motes was driven by a friend from her home in Pacific Palisades to Julia\'s mansion in Malibu. \n \n The visit came after it was reported that Nancy left a five page suicide note in which she accused her famous sibling of driving her to kill herself. \n \n Her fiancé discovered her body, which had been dead as long as 12 hours, but a responding EMT worker recovered the extensive letter, according to the New York Daily News. \n \n In the note, Nancy dedicated three pages to her tortured relationship with the Pretty Woman actress, the Daily News quoted a source close to the investigation as saying. \n \n Gone too soon: Nancy Motes, pictured in August (left), died on Sunday from an apparent drug overdose; she is the half-sister of Julia Roberts (right) \n \n Rage: Nancy Motes, tweeted under her husband-to-be\'s last name online. This vitriolic attack is believed to be against her half-sister, Julia Roberts and happened a little more than a month before she died \n \n Pain: Nancy Motes is also believed to have launched these attacks on the star of Pretty Woman and Mystic Pizza - calling her cruel and blaming her for causing her rage despite her best efforts to remain calm \n \n Sad: Nancy Motes posted these bittersweet tweets in October - in which she laments that she is having to leave her family to find the love she craves from another \n \n \'It was definitely a suicide. She left a five-page suicide letter. The EMT found it,\' the source told the Daily News. \n \n \'There were three pages of rantings that her sister drove her to do this. There was one page to her mom, telling her how much she loved her, and one page apologizing to (her fiancé).\' \n \n Nancy and Dilbeck were scheduled to be married in May, but the Georgia native seemed to be unraveling recently. \n \n On Twitter, she sounded decidedly unstable, lashing out at Julia, whom she claims bullied her about her weight when they were growing up. \'So my ""sister"" said that with all her friends & fans she doesn\'t need any more love. Just so you all know ""America\'s Sweetheart"" is a B****!!\' she tweeted on January 20, referring to Roberts. \'Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She\'s not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally F***ed with me?\' she added in a subsequent tweet before claiming she\'d never been more angry. \'I must admit I maybe going to far… But I never been so angry in my life. I\'m actually a pretty easygoing, peaceful person.\' \n \n \'(M)y own family has abandoned me,\' she tweeted January 22. Three weeks later, she was dead. \n \n The emotional comments, seen on the Twitter handle @Dabbs76, had been deleted by Tuesday morning. \n \n Family: Roberts with Motes and their mother Betty Lou when the star was filming 1997\'s My Best Friend\'s Wedding \n \n The most recent Twitter outburst followed similar rants late last year. \n \n For example, Nancy had written previously of her family abandoning her. \n \n \'Feeling blessed, even though I\'m sick as a dog! I\'m very grateful that I have my loves family, since my own family has abandoned me,\' she tweeted, referring to her new partner. \n \n \n \n Her next tweets also appeared to be angrily directed at the Notting Hill star. \n \n \n \n She tweeted: \'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You’re going to LOVE what’s coming! FYI-You’re an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human. \n \n \n \n \'I must be grateful & not hateful. I must forgive. But Damn that is a REALLY hard thing to do sometimes, right?!?!\' \n \n Back on December 19, Nancy also sounded depressed. She wrote: \'I must remember how blessed I am even in this very low point in my life. I want ALL of my family to have an awesome magical Christmas! \' \n \n \n \n And on December 15 she tweeted: \'Must remember to stay strong. Life is a fight. You have to stay in it.\' \n \n \n \n Back in October Nancy also spoke about her family rift, tweeting: \'It’s a shame when you get more support from strangers than you do from your family. I can’t wait to officially belong to another family!\' \n \n She also wrote that she was getting support from her and Julia’s mother Betty, writing: \'So glad to have the support & love of my friends & mom! \n \n \n \n Still a smashing success: At 46, Roberts is more in demand than ever; here she leaves a talk about her Meryl Streep drama on February 4 \n \n Nancy last tweeted on Saturday, the day before she was found dead in the bathtub. \n \n \n \n She wrote: \'Hope everyone is enjoying their Saturdays & watching East Los High! Season 3 coming soon!\' \n \n \n \n Nancy joined twitter last August and had 69 followers. \n \n \n \n She posted several happy photos with her fiancé John Dilbeck who she was due to marry on May 17. \n \n Nancy had been tweeting excitedly about the big day, on October 21 she wrote: \'I found my beautiful shoes for my wedding day! And anyone that wants to bring me down during all the planning I have to do can kiss my ass!\' \n \n \n \n On October 3 she tweeted a photo of them together, writing: \'YAY! Wedding Venue found! Wedding dress found! Things are truly happening! It\'s all soooo exciting! I love him!\' \n \n Since her tormented tweets were made public overnight, they key sections have been deleted. \n \n \n \n On Monday, her family confirmed to People the 37-year-old had passed away in what appears to be an overdose. \n \n \n \n On top: The actress on the February cover of Vanity Fair, on stands now \n \n \'It is with deep sadness that the family of Nancy Motes ... confirms that she was found dead in Los Angeles yesterday of an apparent drug overdose,\' the statement read. \'There is no official report from the Coroner\'s office yet. The family is both shocked and devastated.\' \n \n \n \n She was discovered in the bathtub of a home by her fiancé John Dilbeck and pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles Coroner\'s Office told MailOnline. \n \n It is believed she was found at a house where she was pet-sitting for a friend. \n \n Today, Ed Winter, assistant chief at the LA County Coroner\'s Office, said: ‘The autopsy has been completed and the cause of death has been deferred depending on the toxicology reports. This can take between six and eight weeks. \n \n \n \n ‘A number of prescription medications were found in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We’re not releasing what illegal drugs they were. \n \n \n \n ‘It could be a possible suicide, but we don’t know the cause of death yet for sure, which is depending on further investigation. It’s more complicated as she also had some medical issues, so we’re not sure what happened at the moment. \n \n \n \n \'We are not being specific what those issues are, but it could mean a number of reasons for her death, she could have been taking a bath and had a heart attack. We just don’t know at this stage.\' \n \n Julia\'s rep did not return calls to MailOnline. The actress cancelled an appearance at an Academy Awards luncheon on Monday. \n \n \n \n Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV\'s Glee. \n \n \n \n Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy\'s dad was Michael Motes and Julia\'s is the late Walter Grady Roberts. \n \n \n \n In August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep. \n \n Thinner: Nancy Motes looked considerably thinner in August 2013 as she grabbed coffee near her home in Santa Monica \n \n The younger sibling had said she was known as Julia\'s \'fat little sister\' and said the Oscar-winner had taunted her about her weight, leading her to undergo weight loss surgery in June 2012. \n \n \n \n Roberts, 46, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of her weight, according to Nancy, which peaked at 20st. \n \n \n \n She resorted to a £20,000 gastric bypass operation last year. \n \n \n \n \'It makes me feel incredibly hurt and very sad,\' Motes said. \'When you\'re in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it\'s intimidating.\' \n \n \n \n Her other siblings include Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, 48, who are also actors. \n \n \n \n Actress Emma Roberts is the daughter of Eric. \n \n \n \n \'I think that growing up as Pretty Woman\'s little sister has definitely made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside,\' she added. \'A lot of my life I felt judged for my weight.\' \n \n Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as hooker Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman. \n \n \n \n The actress, who had won a Golden Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second for Pretty Woman. \n \n \n \n Motes, who described herself as an \'awkward\' child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of her \'very pretty and very popular\' sister. \n \n \n \n She said: \'When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite clear to me and in a not so nice manner. \n \n \n \n \'Julia did not want to see me go down that path [of acting] … So I just got a lot of criticism from Julia, which was very discouraging for me.\' \n \n \n \n After graduating from high school in 1995, Motes auditioned for roles in Hollywood while working as a waitress. But she could not afford to continue so returned to Georgia. \n \n Niece: Emma Roberts, pictured Monday with Evan Peters, was Nancy\'s niece \n \n Three years ago Nancy moved back to Los Angeles, after meeting her fiancé John Dilbeck. But she claimed Roberts started taunting her about her weight again days after she arrived. \n \n \n \n With her weight soaring, she finally decided to have a gastric bypass fitted. \n \n \n \n Motes said she could not afford the £20,000 fee, but rather than ask Roberts, who is worth £90million, for financial help, she took out a loan. \n \n \n \n She had lost 7st since the operation last June and had planned on marrying in May. \n \n However, RadarOnline reported last year that Julia planned to boycott the nuptials because she didn\'t like the groom and didn\'t want to get stuck paying for the wedding. \n \n \n \n \'Julia doesn\'t think much of Nancy\'s husband-to-be,\' the website quoted an insider as saying. \'She\'s convinced he\'s sponging off Nancy, who doesn\'t have much money in the first place.\' \n \n \n \n At the time of her death, it was not known if she had mended her relationship with Julia. \n \n \n \n She said last year: \'It\'s a work in progress, it\'s not going to be fixed overnight, nor do I think it\'s going to be fixed by me just getting skinny.\'', 'Julia Roberts was left devastated and anguished that she could not convince her half-sister Nancy Motes to enter rehab before her tragic drug overdose death in Los Angeles, Calif., on Feb. 9, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned. \n \n Motes, 37, a former production worker on the hit television show Glee, was found dead Sunday in a bathtub at a Los Angeles home, where authorities recovered both prescription and non-prescription drugs. \n \n A source close to Oscar-nominee Roberts told Radar: “The sisters had a very complex relationship. They used to be very close when they were younger. Julia tried in vain over the years, even in the last six months, to get Nancy to go to rehab. Nancy refused the offers and that is when she would often publicly lash out at Julia. \n \n PHOTOS: Stars Who OD’d \n \n “It hurt Julia, but she knew her sister was battling addiction. \n \n “The addiction to prescription drugs made Nancy a totally different person. There would be periods of sobriety and with that brought clarity. It would be during those moments that the sisters would reconnect. Sadly, of course, those times became less frequent before her death.” \n \n As Radar previously reported, Motes called the Pretty Woman star a “b*tch” and appeared to have called her a “hag” as she vented in a series of tweets sent late last month. \n \n PHOTOS: Cheating, Gay Lovers, Incest, Drugs & Lip Synching! 50 Of Hollywood’s Juiciest Confessions \n \n It was yet another illustration of the pair’s rocky relationship after Motes previously declared Roberts led her to take the extreme measure of having gastric bypass surgery. \n \n “When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight,” Motes told the New York Daily News last year. \n \n “She would make it quite clear to me and in a not-so-nice a manner.” \n \n PHOTOS: Celebs Who Died Young \n \n In tweets that have since been deleted, Motes wrote on Jan. 19 under the handle @Dabbs76, “So my ‘sister’ said that with all her friends & fans she doesn’t need anymore love. Just so you all know ‘America’s Sweetheart’ is a B—-H!!’” \n \n She later added, “Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She’s not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally F—ed with me?” \n \n The family insider revealed to Radar that Roberts, 46, made arrangements for her troubled sister to check into a first class rehab facility last year. \n \n “She had agreed to go… this was about a year ago,” the source said. \n \n PHOTOS: Heroin Addicts, Coke Fiends & Celebrity Stoners — Hollywood Drug Dealers Tell All! \n \n “At the last minute, Nancy backed out, gave no reason. Yet, Julia told Nancy if she was ready to get healthy, all she had to do was call.

25,"['A high court ruling blocking extradition to the US of Lauri Love, a student accused of breaking into US government websites, has been welcomed by lawyers and human rights groups as a precedent for trying hacking suspects in the UK in future. \n \n The decision delivered by the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, is highly critical of the conditions Love would have endured in US jails, warning of the risk of suicide. \n \n Lawyers for the 33-year-old, who lives in Suffolk, had argued that Love should be tried in Britain for allegedly hacking into US government websites and that he would be at risk of killing himself if sent to the US. \n \n There was cheering and applause in court on Monday when Burnett announced his decision. He asked supporters to be quiet, saying: “This is a court, not a theatre.” \n \n In his judgment, Burnett said: “It would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr Love in England for the offences alleged against him. Far from it. Much of Mr Love’s argument was based on the contention that this is indeed where he should be prosecuted. \n \n “The CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] must now bend its endeavours to his prosecution, with the assistance to be expected from the authorities in the United States, recognising the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims.” \n \n The court heard evidence from psychiatrists who work in the US prison system and questioned the adequacy of safeguarding procedures in US prisons. \n \n \n \n The CPS, which acts on behalf of the US authorities in the case, said it would read the judgment before deciding whether or not to appeal. It has 14 days to decide whether or not to appeal to the supreme court. \n \n Emerging from the front of the court afterwards, Love said: “This is not just for myself. I hope this sets a precedent for the future for anyone in the same position that they will be tried here.” \n \n At a press conference later, he added: “I am greatly relieved that I’m no longer facing the prospect of being locked up in a country I have never visited. This legal struggle has defined my life for the past four years. I’m not looking forward to be being prosecuted but I think there’s a better chance that it will be done justly and fairly in the UK.” \n \n Keyboard warrior: the British hacker fighting for his life Read more \n \n Love, who holds joint British and Finnish nationality, has Asperger syndrome and severe depression. His supporters had gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice before the hearing carrying placards declaring: “Trump can’t get no Love”, “Free Love”, “Trial at home” and “Give Love a chance”. \n \n They feared he would be held in solitary confinement and face a jail sentence of up to 99 years in the US. \n \n \n \n Welcoming the judgment, Emma Norton, the head of legal casework at Liberty, which intervened in the case, said: “We are delighted that the court has today recognised Lauri’s vulnerability, close family connections to the UK and the potentially catastrophic consequences of extraditing him. This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it’s shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal.” \n \n His father, the Rev Alexander Love, had said his son feared for his life because he did not think he could cope with the trauma of being sent to the US. He also praised Theresa May for devising the legal test that prevented Love’s removal. \n \n \n \n Nick Vamos, a solicitor at the law firm Peters and Peters and a former CPS extradition specialist, said: “This judgment will mean that US and UK prosecutors will need to be very careful in future about how they decide who should prosecute cases of concurrent jurisdiction, and will have to focus far more than previously on a suspect’s connections to the UK.”', 'Lauri Love smiles as he leaves with parents Alexander Love, left, Sirkka-Liisa Love, second left, and girlfriend Sylvia Mann, from The Royal Courts of Justice in London, Monday, Feb. 5, 2018.

A 2014 FBI legal filing says Love is allegedly a ""sophisticated hacker"" who stole sensitive personal information and made it available online. \n \n The FBI says an SQL injection was used to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion and backdoors were inserted into the websites that could be exploited in the future. The website of the United States Sentencing Commission was also defaced and hosted a video created by Anonymous. \n \n Love has neither confirmed or denied any role in Operation Last Resort, as The Guardian reported in September 2017. \n \n Before this, in October 2013, the National Crime Agency arrested Love after pretending to deliver him a parcel at his parent\'s home. The body later issued legal proceedings telling Love to hand over passwords to his encrypted laptop but courts ruled this would not be legal and denied the NCA\'s request. No charges were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). \n \n The legal arguments \n \n The court case Love v Government of the United States of America – which is being ruled on today – was held in the Royal Courts of Justice in November last year. The appeal was took to court by Love after he lost a court case for extradition in 2016. \n \n Read next A cyberattack on Russia wouldn\'t be a good move for the UK A cyberattack on Russia wouldn\'t be a good move for the UK \n \n In the case three months ago, Love\'s legal team, led by Edward Fitzgerald QC, argued that Love should not be tried in the US because of his medical conditions. ""There’s a very real risk that he would commit suicide,"" The Guardian reported at the time. ""There’s a virtual certainty that his condition would deteriorate."" \n \n It was argued the stress of being removed from his family and routine would exacerbate his conditions. Fitzgerald said the case against Love could be held in the UK and there would be a ""real risk of inhuman treatment"" against Love if he was sent to the US. \n \n Judge Nina Tempia, at Westminster Magistrates\' court, ruled in September 2016 (court documents) that Love should be extradited to the US. She said: there is a ""strong public interest"" in the UK upholding its extradition treaties with the US; the offences are serious; ""millions of dollars\' worth of damage"" was caused by the hacks; that US officials say they can manage vulnerable people in their prison system. \n \n However Tempia\'s ruling said Love is ""at high risk of committing suicide"" if extradited and he is ""of good character"" and is working and studying. \n \n Ultimately, it was decided that he should be extradited as Tempia was ""satisfied his needs will be comprehensively met by the US authorities"". Two months later, in November 2016, home secretary Amber Rudd signed an order that Love should be extradited. His appeal was then launched. \n \n The change in the law \n \n Love\'s case has many similarities with that of hacker Gary McKinnon. In October 2012, Theresa May – the then home secretary – blocked the extradition of McKinnon to the US after a 10 year battle. He faced up to 60 years in US jail if convicted of hacking charges. \n \n Advertisement \n \n McKinnon, who has Asperger\'s syndrome and suffered with depression, was allowed to stay in the UK after it was found his condition would ""give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life"" that it would breach his human rights. \n \n May also introduced a forum bar. ""This will mean that where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so,"" she said at the time. \n \n The forum bar exists under section 83A of the Extradition Act 20013. It allows judges to block extradition to the US and other countries if a crime was committed in the UK and if it is in the accused\'s interests to stand trial in the UK. Essentially, the addition to the law ensured that government ministers would not have to make any final decisions on an extradition case when it comes to human rights grounds. Speaking ahead of Love\'s trial one of his lawyers, Karen Todner, said if the forum bar is successful ""the UK police will have a green light to take more prosecutions here and not bow to the US pressure to extradite"".']",4,"– A 33-year-old British man who allegedly hacked into the FBI, NASA, and Federal Reserve and did millions of dollars worth of damage as a form of protest in 2012 and 2013 won't be stepping foot on US soil anytime soon.

The AP reports the judges felt his suicide risk would be lessened if he was jailed in England, where family and friends would be accessible to him.

26,"['With Verizon’s long-anticipated bid to buy Yahoo finally official, speculation turns to what happens to the Internet giant’s CEO, Marissa Mayer. \n \n In a Tumblr post, Mayer wrote on Monday, “I’m planning to stay... It’s important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter,” a position she reiterated in a CNBC interview Monday morning, although she also said she was “open minded” about the future. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer in the hot seat as company struggles 2:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n For some, this indicates that the onetime Google wunderkind might depart after the deal is finished in the first quarter of next year. \n \n “It might be for a short period,” Morningstar equity analyst Ali Mogharabi said of the prospect of Mayer’s staying on. “They might need her input during the integration process.” \n \n After that, though, all bets are off. \n \n RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney said he expected AOL chief Tim Armstrong to lead the combined AOL-Yahoo company, calling him “a very seasoned internet executive,” in the CNBC interview. “He’s the right person to be running the combined assets,” Mahaney said. \n \n Ultimately, staying at Yahoo might not be Mayer’s choice to make, pointed out Scott Kessler, equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \n \n “She started out with just so much interest and enthusiasm and and excitement… and the last year or two have been tremendously disappointing,” he said. \n \n Since being tapped to run Yahoo in 2012 after a scandal involving previous CEO Scott Thompson misrepresenting his credentials, Mayer initially boosted her standing with workers by bringing in Google-style staff perks like free lunch and phones. \n \n Her elimination of telecommuting in 2013 was less well received, though. Aside from running counter to the typical Silicon Valley corporate culture, which tends to encourage remote work, some charged that Yahoo’s ban was unfair to working parents, especially since it was widely reported that Mayer had a nursery built near her office to accommodate the baby boy she had a few months after taking the top spot at Yahoo. Mayer’s two-week maternity leaves, both in 2012 as well as three years later, when she had twin girls, also sparked a larger conversation about parental leave in the tech industry. \n \n “She has become the face of Yahoo, for better or worse. She has become a lightning rod,” Kessler said. \n \n Some of her choices when it came to Yahoo’s operations were also questioned, especially as the promised turnaround failed to materialize. \n \n Read More: Yahoo to Lay Off 15 Percent of Workforce, Revamp Company \n \n “I would say it’s pretty much a mixed bag,” Mogharabi said. “The acquisition of Brightroll was a good one,” he said of Yahoo’s 2014 purchase of the ad platform, but he pointed out that its 2013 purchase of microblogging platform Tumblr for $1.1 billion didn’t pay off the way the company hoped. \n \n “While Marissa stabilized Yahoo during her tenure, she missed on the big trends,” Constellation Research founder and principal analyst R “Ray” Wang said via email. “Most folks would expect Marissa to leave within a year,” he noted. \n \n Leaving could be lucrative for Mayer. According to Equilar, a compensation data and research firm, she will make just under $57 million if Verizon decides not to keep her on. Through the end of last year, Equilar estimates that Mayer earned nearly $219 million, including $115 million in “realized pay,” which includes her cash earnings, value of shares vested during her tenure and gains from exercising options. \n \n That kind of money would give Mayer enough breathing room to take some time deliberating her next moves, which might be the best plan for her, Kessler suggested. \n \n “I think she would benefit from some time between what she‘s doing now and what she’s going to do next,” he said. “There are a lot of options out there for her.”', ""Marissa Mayer hits out at 'gender bias' as Yahoo is sold for $5bn \n \n Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business for $4.83bn (£3.62bn) in cash on Monday, marking the final chapter in the struggling fortunes of the fading web pioneer. \n \n Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive officer, has faced a barrage of criticism over her tenure. She hit out at “gender-charged” reporting in an interview with the Financial Times after the sale. \n \n “I’ve tried to be gender-blind and believe tech is a gender-neutral zone but do think there has been gender-charged reporting,” she said. “We all see the things that only plague women leaders, like articles that focus on their appearance, like Hillary Clinton sporting a new pantsuit. I think all women are aware of that, but I had hoped in 2015 and 2016 that I would see fewer articles like that. It’s a shame.” \n \n Verizon, the US’s largest telecommunications company by subscribers, will combine Yahoo with another fallen giant of the first internet age, AOL, which it bought last year for $4.4bn. \n \n By the numbers: why big-name businesses are bidding for Yahoo Read more \n \n After the deal, expected to be complete in 2017, Yahoo will be left as a holding company for its valuable stakes in web businesses in China and Japan. Yahoo has a 15% stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba and a 35.5% interest in Yahoo Japan. \n \n “The sale of our operating business, which effectively separates our Asian asset equity stakes, is an important step in our plan to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo,” Mayer said in a statement on Monday. \n \n Founded in a Stanford University dorm room in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo as “Jerry and David’s Guide To The World Wide Web”, Yahoo grew rapidly through the 1990s to become one of the pre-eminent internet companies of its generation. \n \n Offering email, news, shopping and search, Yahoo went public in 1996, with its share price soaring 154% on day one. In January 2000, Yahoo was valued at $125bn. But the company failed to keep pace with the changing tech landscape as Google came to dominate search and Facebook social media. \n \n Microsoft launched a $44.6bn hostile bid for Yahoo in 2008. On Monday, the company was valued at $37bn while Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was valued at $518bn and Facebook at $349bn. \n \n The new generation of tech companies have also outstripped Yahoo. Mayer’s company may still have more than one billion active monthly users but Verizon’s price is less than a quarter of Snapchat’s current valuation. \n \n \n \n Yahoo will continue as an independent company until the deal receives shareholder and regulatory approval, the companies said. \n \n The sale is an ignominious end to Mayer’s plans to turn Yahoo around. Mayer, a highly rated Google executive, joined Yahoo in July 2012. Before her arrival the company was in disarray and had had four CEOs in three years. \n \n Mayer promised a “renewed focus on product innovation to drive user experience and advertising revenue”. But shareholders lost faith in her after a wild spending spree in which she tried to build Yahoo’s content business by adding the blog site Tumblr, for $1.1bn, and signed deals with TV news anchor Katie Couric and the National Football League that failed to pay off. \n \n In a Tumblr blogpost, Mayer said she planned to stay at Yahoo, but Verizon’s Marni Walden, who will head the combined company, told CNBC the new leadership team had yet to be determined. \n \n Should Mayer be forced out, she is in for a payoff of $137m. Yahoo’s boss has already taken home $78m since she was installed as CEO, according to the stock analytics firm MSCI. Based on the terms of the company’s most recent proxy statement, she will take home another $59m if she’s dismissed from the company after a buyout. \n \n Some commentators were skeptical about the combined power of AOL and Yahoo. John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said the merger was an alliance of two weak companies unlikely to form a single strong one. “Technology history is littered with the remnants of once all-powerful businesses – take Nokia and RIM, makers of the Blackberry,” Colley said. He said it was difficult to see how Verizon would benefit from this acquisition. \n \n The sale does not include Yahoo’s cash, its shares in Alibaba, its shares in Yahoo Japan, Yahoo’s convertible notes, certain minority investments and Yahoo’s non-core patents. \n \n \n \n The Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments are worth about $40bn, while Yahoo had a market value of about $37.4bn as of Friday’s close. \n \n Verizon prevailed over rival bidders for Yahoo, including AT&T; a group led by the Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by the billionaire Warren Buffett; the private equity firm TPG Capital; and a consortium of buyout firms, Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners. \n \n The telecoms company is hoping that a combined AOL and Yahoo will create a strong third player to compete with Alphabet and Facebook for online revenues. \n \n Reuters contributed to this article""]",2,"– Marissa Mayer says coverage of her four years at the helm of Yahoo has been ""gender charged.""

""I think all women are aware of that, but I had hoped in 2015 and 2016 that I would see fewer articles like that. It’s a shame."" It was announced Monday that Verizon would acquire the struggling Internet pioneer for $4.83 billion, which, per the Guardian, puts an ""ignominious end to Mayer’s plans to turn Yahoo around.""

India’s government is advising... (Associated Press) \n \n NEW DELHI (AP) — India\'s government is advising pregnant women to avoid all meat, eggs and lusty thoughts. \n \n Doctors say the advice is preposterous, and even dangerous, considering India\'s already-poor record with maternal health. Women are often the last to eat or receive health care in traditionally patriarchal Indian households. \n \n Malnutrition and anemia, or iron deficiency, are key factors behind India\'s having one of the world\'s highest rates of maternal mortality, with 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulting in the mother\'s death in 2015. That\'s better than five years earlier, when the maternal mortality rate was 205 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, but still far worse than China\'s 27 per 100,000 or the United States\' 14 per 100,000, according to UNICEF. \n \n ""The government is doling out unscientific and irrational advice, instead of ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet,"" said gynecologist Arun Gadre, who is based in the western Indian city of Pune but works in rural areas. \n \n The government booklet, titled ""Mother and Child Care,"" smacks of religious dogma and ignores widely accepted medical evidence that pregnant women benefit from eating protein-rich meats and can safely engage in sex, doctors said. \n \n It says pregnant women should also shun ""impure thoughts"" and look at pictures of beautiful babies to benefit the fetus. \n \n ""Pregnant women should detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,"" reads the booklet, released last week by the Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy, a part of the government\'s ministry that promotes traditional and alternative medicine. \n \n The traditional medicine minister defended the booklet as containing ""wisdom accumulated over many centuries,"" and said it did not advise specifically against sex, only against all thoughts of desire or lust. \n \n ""The booklet puts together relevant facts culled out from clinical practice in the fields of yoga and naturopathy,"" Minister Shripad Naik said. \n \n The advice is unlikely to be followed at the many government-run health centers across India. They are operated by the Health Ministry, which has had past conflicts with the traditional medicine ministry and follows more scientific practices. \n \n The booklet is the latest push for vegetarianism by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Hindu-nationalist government, which already advocates avoiding beef and strictly limits the transportation and slaughter of cows, which are considered sacred by Hindus. \n \n But the latest homily to pregnant women has outraged the medical community. \n \n ""This is a national shame. If the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,"" Gadre said. ""This is absurd advice to be giving to pregnant women in a country like India."" \n \n About a third of India\'s 1.3 billion people struggle to live on less than $2 a day. Many are lucky to eat more than one full meal a day, and women often give their portions up to their hungry children or husbands. \n \n Malnourished women are more likely to give birth to underweight babies, who then are in danger of being ""stunted"" or not growing to their full height and weight. A full 48 percent of all Indian children under the age of 5 are considered stunted, according to a 2015 report by UNICEF. \n \n ""Undernourished girls grow into undernourished women. Married by their families while still in their teens, these girls become pregnant by the time they are 17 or 18, when their bodies have not matured enough to safely deliver a child,"" said Amit Sengupta, a physician and health care activist with the Delhi Science Forum, a public advocacy organization. \n \n He said the government\'s advice to pregnant women betrayed ""backward thinking"" and hostility toward evidence-based science. \n \n ""This kind of advice is detrimental to women\'s health,"" he said.']",2,"– A government pamphlet's advice for pregnant women in India isn't going over well. The booklet titled ""Mother and Child Care"" tells the women to ""detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,"" spurn ""impure thoughts,"" look at ""beautiful pictures"" to benefit their fetus, and avoid meat and eggs, per the AP and Hindustan Times. According to one gynecologist in India, the advice isn't just ""unscientific and irrational,"" but it's ""a national shame"" in a country where 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulted in the mother's death in 2015, due in part to malnutrition and anemia. That's compared to 14 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies in the US, according to UNICEF. Since women are typically the last to eat and receive medical care in Indian households, the government should be ""ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet,"" says gynecologist Arun Gadre. This would also help prevent stunted births; some 48% of Indian children under 5 have not grown to the proper height and weight. But ""if the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,"" Gadre says. With its advice against lust, the pamphlet also suggests that engaging in sex is dangerous for pregnant women, contrary to medical evidence.

29,"['Correction: Earlier versions of this article misspelled the name of reality-TV personality Tareq Salahi. This version has been corrected. \n \n A couple of thousand people were held hostage by Charlie Sheen’s ego Tuesday night in an auditorium named after the female descendants of the American Revolution, half a mile from the World War II Memorial in the capital of the free world. This prompts an icky existential question: If the abusive ex-star of a CBS sitcom can compel a legion of citizens to pay $104.25 apiece to be doused in cultural bile, is the free world a little too free? \n \n The answer, of course, is no. Mostly no. No, except for the five seconds after Sheen seemed to imply that he believes President Obama wasn’t born in the United States, triggering boisterous applause from the mostly young, near-capacity crowd at the 3,700-seat DAR Constitution Hall. Sheen seemed to toy with the idea of running for president (with Nicolas Cage) and noted that his birth certificate was not “Photoshopped.” \n \n The man has become so unreadable that it was hard to tell whether he was joking or serious. He was, though, noncommittal about running and occasionally circumspect. \n \n “Every day is just one day,” Sheen said at the top of the show. “Tomorrow is not here yet.” \n \n It was the end of a long day for Sheen, who deployed his lawyers to two court hearings in Southern California on Tuesday morning, charioted himself in a black Rolls-Royce to the Van Nuys Airport that afternoon, and blazed across the continent in a private jet to walk onstage 67 minutes late for his show in downtown Washington, the halfway point in his 20-city tour titled “Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option,” a kind of Sherman’s March of the male libido. \n \n Washington as a whole greeted Sheen with a feisty, inebriated bear hug, but there was some wonky thoughtfulness in the crowd. \n \n “I came here to see Charlie Sheen on an extended loop and be both horrified and entertained,” said a 34-year-old lobbyist who declined to give her name because she’s a “professional girl” who “cares about my future.” \n \n “Not often can you see a public figure implode in front of your eyes — usually you can only see that through the media,” said her 40-year-old lobbyist friend, who was also too embarrassed to be identified. \n \n “We perpetuate this image that is fake and a lie, and we put it on television,” railed a TV reporter into her cellphone — presumably to an editor — as she prepared to do a spot from outside the venue before the show started. “That’s how I feel as a journalist.” \n \n Me, too, but here’s the straightest scoop deliverable: The show began with a stream-of-consciousness monologue about Sheen’s hatred of ex-wives and his failure to secure sole custody of his children earlier in the day. It lurched onward to a dry sit-down interview — led by much-booed WBIG (100.3 FM) host Tommy Griffiths — about the first time Sheen met Marlon Brando. The crowd quaked with catcalls whenever Sheen wasn’t talking about doing drugs or manhandling women. \n \n “ENTERTAIN US,” boomed a male voice as Sheen waxed philosophical on the hard living of Dennis Hopper. \n \n “SHUT THE [EXPLETIVE] UP AND SAY SOMETHING WEIRD,” demanded another. \n \n It has been less than two months since Sheen outed himself as a warlock who is capable of ingesting “epic” amounts of cocaine, vanquishing addiction with his superhuman mind, shrugging off his nearly $2 million-an-episode job with Warner Bros. and orating on national television about the vague, seemingly mutable bylaws of nature and space-time (Google “winning” and “tiger blood” and “Adonis DNA” and so on). \n \n In the first week or so of his renaissance (or breakdown, depending on your standards), it seemed as if Sheen was onto something, as if he were imbued with a spiritual clarity reserved for prophets, as if he were pulverizing and remolding the very notion of celebrity. \n \n That notion of celebrity now seems to belong to his audiences — or at least the one at DAR, whose restlessness guided the rhythms of the show and whose outbursts were often more entertaining than the ramblings of Sheen or his better-received guest, stand-up comic Jeff Ross. \n \n “Curiosity about exploitation” was why 33-year-old Arlington salesman Johnny Champane came with three friends at the last minute. “Exploitation of himself. Of us. We bought tickets, didn’t we?” \n \n Since this was Washington, Griffiths asked Sheen how he’d handle Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi (“I’d make him marry [my ex-wives] Brooke and Denise”) and about what he’d defund to balance the budget (disband the Fed and “send the IRS to prison”). The crowd veered between boos and applause so frequently and quickly that one was indistinguishable from another. \n \n “Geez, you guys hate everything,” Sheen said at one point. \n \n Recognizable Washingtonians in attendance included Tareq and Michaele Salahi, the infamous White House gate-crashers and erstwhile reality-TV personalities, who signed autographs in the lobby, where they inadvertently created the event-horizon of a cultural black hole.', 'New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, right, and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announce the arrest of 19 people and seizure of 254 guns as part of gun smuggling between the Carolinas and New York, Monday,... (Associated Press) \n \n A pair of gunrunners smuggled firearms into New York City by hiding them in luggage they carried on discount buses that offered cheap fares and lesser odds of getting caught, authorities said Monday. \n \n An undercover city police officer posing as a gun broker for criminal customers bought 254 weapons from the men in dozens of transactions since last year _ the largest gun seizures in the city in recent memory. One of the guns was an assault rifle that was disassembled and transported in a girlfriend\'s zebra-striped bag, authorities said. \n \n The alleged smugglers, Walter Walker and Earl Campbell, were among 19 people arrested in New York and in North Carolina and South Carolina _ states where the guns originated _ as the result of a 10-month investigation. Also charged was an aspiring rapper from Brooklyn. \n \n Walker and Campbell were arrested earlier this month by local police in their home states, authorities said. The names of their defense attorneys were not immediately available. \n \n New York Police Department officials and prosecutors announced details of the case on Monday, citing it as another example of a persistent black market in which firearms from the South can sell for three times their original price in the city. New York has some of the nation\'s strictest gun-control measures and a mayor who has crusaded for tougher laws in other states. \n \n ""There is no doubt that the seizure of these guns has saved lives,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference. \n \n Wiretap evidence showed that sellers in the Carolinas knew the weapons were destined for New York, said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan. \n \n ""Perhaps the two most disturbing aspects of the gun-trafficking operation were the simplicity of the business model, and the complete indifference of the gun suppliers to the mayhem their actions would cause here in New York City,"" Brennan said. ""The marketing strategy was buy low, sell high and keep a low profile."" \n \n The gun case was a spinoff of a drug investigation in Brooklyn that turned up Instagram photos of handguns and wads of cash posted by the rapper. Wiretap and other evidence led investigators to Walker, 29, of Sanford, N.C. and Campbell, 24, of Rock Hill, S.C., who were smuggling guns separately but using the same middleman in New York City, authorities said. \n \n The two tapped a loose network of suppliers in their hometowns, authorities said. Some guns were obtained on the black market, while others were bought from gun dealers using straw buyers to get around one-gun-a-month restrictions. \n \n ""The problem is that the gun laws passed now, so it\'s like now I can only buy a gun from a gun store every 30 days,"" Campbell complained in one conversation, according to an indictment. ""So I had to, like, pay different people to keep buying different guns."" \n \n Before heading to New York, Campbell would get photos of the guns his suppliers were offering and send the images to the undercover officer, authorities said. Both defendants would travel to the city carrying a dozen or more handguns, rifles and shotguns in bags that were stowed in luggage compartments of Chinatown-based carriers also favored by drug couriers, investigators said. \n \n One of the discount bus companies charges $60 one-way from Raleigh, N.C., to New York. The fare is about half that charged by Greyhound, which, unlike the Chinatown buses, requires identification for boarding. \n \n Walker met two times last year with the middleman and the undercover officer at the rapper\'s Brooklyn recording studio to sell the undercover firearms, the indictment said. He also alleged sold weapons to the undercover in April in Manhattan. \n \n In January, the undercover officer met with Campbell and his girlfriend, who was carrying assault rifle parts in her zebra-striped suitcase, authorities said. The girlfriend struggled to assemble the weapon in the backseat of a car by using a YouTube instructional video she called up on her smartphone, investigators said. When she failed, the undercover bought the pieces anyway for $1,100, they said.']",2,"– Charlie Sheen may have alienated his ""truther"" fans, but it looks like he'll be able to replace them with birthers. Politics was on the agenda when Sheen's ""Violent Torpedo of Truth"" tour hit Washington, DC, Tuesday night and the actor got plenty of cheers when he raised the birth certificate issue, reports the Washington Post. ""For starters, I was f**king born here, how about that? And I got proof!"" Sheen said. ""Nothing Photoshopped about my birth certificate."" Sheen—observing that a poll shows him beating ""that lunatic from Alaska"" Sarah Palin—discussed the possibility of a presidential bid, with Nicolas Cage as his running mate, Politico reports. President Sheen would legalize pot, ""send the IRS to prison,"" and deal with Moammar Gadhafi by sending ex-wife Denise Richards and soon-to-be-ex-wife Brooke Mueller to Libya. ""If I run for president and win, country music is illegal,"" Sheen told the crowd."
30,"['The establishment is fighting back, alright. \n \n This has not received a lot of national attention, but the Republican legislature in Florida is about to push through a plan which puts Allen West at serious risk, and the person leading the effort is one of Mitt Romney’s spokemen. As reported by The Shark Tank: \n \n After last night’s [Jan. 26] Republican Presidential debate, the candidates’ respective spinmeisters made their cases to the media as to why their guy won the debate. One of Governor Mitt Romney’s spokesmen was Florida Representative Will Weatherford, and during the course of his remarks in the “Spin Room”, he shed a very dim light on the ongoing redistricting process in the Florida Legislature…. West’s congressional district inexplicably sheds the most out support as compared to all other incumbent Republican and Democrat Congressman. A few weeks back we quoted an unnamed legislator saying that, “Allen West was screwed”, a statement which was originally made about made five months before the purposed maps were made public, leading insiders to believe that the fix was in against Allen West.

(AP Photo/Evan... (Associated Press) \n \n CLEVELAND (AP) — After weeks of planning and one ferocious outburst that upstaged nearly everything on the Republican National Convention\'s first day, conservatives\' feisty but always improbable effort to deny Donald Trump the GOP presidential nomination succumbed to multiple causes of death. \n \n The lack of vital signs grew daily, culminating during Tuesday\'s roll call of the states that formally put Trump over the top. That vote saw a fizzling of what conservatives hoped would be an effort by some delegates to brazenly ignore state party rules and back the candidate of their choice, not Trump. \n \n ""Whatever may or may not have been planned, apparently it didn\'t happen,"" said Colorado delegate Kevin Grantham. He said party leaders wanted to ""make sure that Donald Trump is the nominee, regardless of what the states said, regardless of what the delegates say."" \n \n The anti-Trump conservatives unified with another faction trying to alter party rules to shift power from the establishment Republican National Committee to grassroots activists, including many supporters of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a defeated presidential hopeful. But they were badly outnumbered by Trump delegates and party regulars who believed, like him or not, he\'d won this year\'s GOP primaries. \n \n Also weighing against them — the rebels\' lack of an alternative candidate, vigorous lobbying by an alliance between the Trump campaign and the RNC and a growing sense that it was time to unite against presumptive Democratic pick Hillary Clinton. \n \n ""You can stand your ground until the point comes when you would be compromising the country or the state,"" said Steve House, chairman of the Colorado GOP, whose delegation was loaded with dissidents and Cruz supporters. ""The team said, \'Let\'s stand up and support the nominee.\' "" \n \n On the other side of the arena, the Utah delegation gamely announced that it was casting its 40 votes for Cruz. But the presiding officer awarded all those delegates to Trump because of a quirk in Utah GOP rules that allow votes only for active candidates at the convention — and Trump was the only one. \n \n ""There\'s been a lot of effort to make sure we have a smooth convention, that Donald Trump is the nominee and that we unite,"" said Phil Wright, chairman of the Utah delegation. He said awarding all the votes to Trump was the GOP\'s way ""of trying to squash any dissent."" \n \n Since it became clear last spring that Trump was the likely nominee, conservative delegates around the country plotted ways to use the party\'s rules to derail him at the convention. They organized using social media, conference calls and seemingly endless emails. \n \n But they were soundly thrashed last week when the convention\'s rules committee approved guidelines for this week\'s gathering. That carried over to the convention itself, which is run by party leaders who wield the gavel and make final rulings on disputes. \n \n On Monday, conservatives demanded a final shot at rewriting party rules but were blocked. Their roars of outrage drew widespread coverage and distracted from party leaders\' efforts to show unity, but still they lost. \n \n During Tuesday\'s roll call, the Alaska delegation split its 28 votes among Trump, Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Convention officials counted all 28 Alaskan delegates for Trump, citing a discrepancy in state party rules, and overruled the delegation when it demanded a fresh count. \n \n Underscoring the futility in challenging party leaders, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus explained the ruling against Alaska to the entire convention and said, ""In any event, have a great night."" He then quickly left the stage as music began to play, leaving the Alaska delegates unhappy and vanquished. \n \n ___ \n \n AP congressional correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report.']",2,"– ISIS really wants to make sure it covers all its bases: A recruitment video released yesterday stars two deaf and mute fighters using sign language.

""We need measures worth 1.5 billion euros to finalize the 11.5 billion euro package."" \n \n Near-bankrupt Greece is fighting an increasingly desperate battle to convince skeptical European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders it has turned over a new leaf and is ready to push through long-delayed reforms to overhaul its recession-hit economy. \n \n But the lenders have so far appeared far from convinced, and officials have told Reuters Greece is likely to require a new debt restructuring that the euro zone - faced with market turmoil in Italy and Spain as well - can ill afford. \n \n Greek media have reported that the country\'s leaders are discussing possible layoffs of contractors in the public sector, a cap on pensions, cuts in welfare benefits, reductions in tax exemptions, and lower salaries for public employees as well as raising the retirement age by a year to make up the shortfall in savings. \n \n PRESSURE ON CASH RESERVES \n \n A decision on a new tranche of aid for Greece is not expected until September, and the country\'s already dire financial position appears to be getting increasingly precarious. \n \n ""The fact that we have not received the agreed aid installments has put pressure on our cash reserves.

Johnson Jr. pleaded for the community to “stop the violence” and “put the guns down.” \n \n On Tuesday, Johnson, 39, also became a victim of deadly violence and gunfire. \n \n Johnson was fatally shot about 1:11 p.m. Tuesday as he drove on 89th Avenue in East Oakland, not far from where a street shrine to his son and grandson had been erected after their deaths at 90th Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard. \n \n Despite his wounds he was able to drive to the 8500 block of MacArthur, where he crashed into some parked cars near Castlemont High School. \n \n Oakland police alerted by ShotSpotter gave him CPR at the scene, but he later died at a hospital. No motive has been released by police for the killing and no arrests made. \n \n Johnson’s son, Andrew “Drew” Thomas, 20, and Thomas’ young son, Drew Leon Deon Jackson, were fatally shot August 7, 2013, by someone who fired into the rear of a Brookfield Village home on Ghormley Avenue at 2:46 a.m. \n \n Reading this on your phone or tablet?

Johnson, who died Nov. 1 at Children’s Hospital Oakland after a battle with lymphoma. \n \n And the memories of what happened to Johnson’s other son and grandson have never faded. \n \n The family, Smith said, is handling the latest tragedy “very hard.” \n \n “He helped everybody, he loved everybody,” Smith said. “He didn’t mess with nobody, he was like a big teddy bear. I’m not saying that because I was his mother, but because I know.” \n \n Smith spoke with pride of Johnson’s Drewski Designs business, which made T-shirts and clothing for picnics, anniversaries, funerals and special events: “A lot of people called him, wanting him to make them this and that.

32,"['GREENSBURG, Ind. -- A mom who has been behind bars since 1996 accused of murdering her toddler son in an arson fire, walked free from jail Wednesday after new evidence was presented that led a court to grant her a new trial. \n \n A sheriff led Kristine Bunch, wearing a new dress and black patent leather shoes and carrying her prison clothes in a Wal-Mart bag, out the door of the jail. He let go of her arm and then said quietly: ""You\'re free."" \n \n Bunch, 38, turned down the sidewalk and went straight to her mother, Susan Hubbard. They had a long embrace. \n \n Next in line for Bunch was her son, 16-year-old Trenton, who had never visited his mother outside of prison, who has never slept under the same roof with her except for his very first night. Bunch went back to the Indiana Women\'s Prison the day after giving birth at a local hospital. \n \n Authorities say Bunch set fire to her mobile home in a blaze that killed her 3-year-old son, Tony. \n \n Bunch, then 22, was sentenced to 60 years. But on Wednesday, at 38, she was released, pending a new trial that was granted in March by the Indiana Court of Appeals. \n \n The Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law took up Bunch\'s case in 2007 and was joined in the cause by Chicago attorney Ron Safer, whose Schiff Hardin firm worked on the case at no cost. In 2009, they presented new evidence to the appeals court based, in part, on technological advances in fire investigations. \n \n The new evidence, Safer said, made it impossible for the fire to have happened the way the state alleged, that some test results the state provided were simply incorrect. In actuality, tests showed that he died of carbon monoxide poisoning, Safer said. Had the fire been set with an accelerant in the manner prosecutors alleged, he would have died from burns. \n \n On Wednesday, Senior Circuit Judge W. Michael Wilke, based on the fact that Bunch\'s family put up bond money for her in 1996, said the words she and her family had waited 16 years to hear: ""The defendant will be released from the Department of Corrections."" \n \n Decatur County prosecutors were unavailable for comment. Bunch has a court appearance next week. But, Safer said, ""Today she is a free woman, and we are determined to make sure that she has spent her last day behind bars."" \n \n Bunch said she was initially in a state of shock upon being sentenced to 60 years for arson and the murder of her son. She likened it to a bad dream that wouldn\'t end. Upon her release, Bunch was joyful but expressed no bitterness over a conviction she has always maintained was a mistake. \n \n ""I haven\'t been by myself,"" she said. ""I had a family that stood by me. I had people that believed in me and stepped up. And you can\'t receive blessings like that and be bitter."" \n \n While in prison, Bunch said she took part in Kairos prison ministry and became a Catholic. She earned undergraduate degrees in English and anthropology from Ball State University. And now she has dreams of going to law school, focusing on criminal law and joining a wrongful conviction team. \n \n ""I want to give back. I\'ve been very blessed,"" she said. ""One day I want to fight for others because others fought for me."" \n \n First, Bunch said she wants to get reacquainted with her family. \n \n Trenton already has a long list of things he wants to do with his mom. \n \n He wants to take a trip to the zoo, go to a concert, have her watch him run track in the spring if he makes the team. \n \n ""I want to do the stuff that I should have been able to do a long time ago,"" he said, ""and never got to do."" \n \n Initially, though, Trenton may have to help his mother navigate her 16-year time warp. When she was last free, cellphones were the size of shoeboxes, and she was amazed at the tiny devices her friends and her legal team were toting, that half the courtroom had to cough up at the judge\'s order before her hearing began. \n \n And then there\'s the Internet -- she\'s heard about it but never seen it. There\'s no access in the prison. \n \n ""My son said I\'m going to teach you how to Facebook,"" she said, ""and we\'re going to look at the Internet."" \n \n But Bunch also relishes the idea of much simpler pleasures. She wants to watch her son sleep. \n \n ""I\'ve never gotten to see my son sleep except for little naps when he would come visit me,"" she said. ""I want to be able to bounce in his room all night and look at him while he\'s asleep.""', 'In the early morning hours of June 30, 1995, a fire sparked to life in Kristine Bunch\'s mobile home. It fanned out across the floor and climbed up the walls, then formed an impassable barrier across the middle of the trailer. Bunch, 21, snapped awake in the living room. Her three-year-old son, Tony, shrieked for her on the other side of the flames. \n \n Bunch staggered outside and howled for a neighbor. She bashed Tony\'s window with a tricycle. As the flames lashed 30 feet into the dawn sky, a fire engine tore up to the house. A firefighter, crawling on his belly, found Tony\'s charred body in the bedroom. \n \n Bunch told police she had no idea what caused the fire. Soon, though, arson investigators determined that a liquid accelerant such as kerosene or lighter fluid had been poured in Tony\'s bedroom and the living room. Police arrested Bunch on charges of arson and felony murder. Eight months later, Bunch went on trial. By then, she was 22 and unexpectedly pregnant with a second child. The evidence against her seemed overwhelming. Two arson investigators gave compelling testimony for the prosecution, and the jury took only a few hours to convict her on both counts. \n \n At sentencing, Bunch recalled, the judge sneered down at her belly. \n \n ""I understand that you have arranged to have yourself impregnated,"" he said. ""You thought it would work to your advantage somehow in this process. It will not. You will not raise that child."" \n \n The judge gave her the maximum sentence: 60 years. \n \n \n \n Karen Daniel and Judy Royal are obsessed with people like Bunch. \n \n During their nearly 30 combined years at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University Law School, the two lawyers have helped exonerate more than two dozen people once found guilty of horrendous crimes. Most of the people they have freed are men; just four are women. And for a long time, Daniel and Royal thought that disparity made perfect sense. Men are convicted of crimes, especially violent crimes, at much higher rates than are women. So it follows that most people exonerated of crimes are also men: The National Registry of Exonerations, a University of Michigan Law School database that has cataloged information on more than 1,600 exonerations nationwide since 1989, includes just 148 women. \n \n About three years ago, however, Daniel and Royal began to question whether that number was too low. Women make up about 11 percent of the people convicted of violent crimes, but just 6 percent of those exonerated of violent crimes. At the urging of a former client, Julie Rea Harper—who spent four years in prison for the murder of her son before a serial killer confessed to the crime—Daniel and Royal decided to try to figure out if there was anything that set exonerated women apart. \n \n They started by looking at the few women whose cases they had worked on themselves. ""I haven\'t had any men\'s cases that looked like these four cases,"" Daniel recalls thinking. ""Could that really be a coincidence?"" \n \n After three years of pursuing that question, Daniel and Royal have concluded that most innocence projects—including their own legal clinic—are failing to bring justice to wrongly convicted women. They have identified factors that make female clients more difficult to exonerate, and uncovered startling facts that distinguish the cases of wrongly convicted women from those of men. And they have launched a project that could change how the American innocence movement helps these women get justice. \n \n \n \n Daniel and Royal started by digging deep into the exonerations database. Their first insight had to do with DNA evidence—the very breakthrough that launched the innocence movement a quarter century ago. ""Women tend not to be convicted of the types of crimes that can be overturned based on the results of DNA testing,"" Daniel explained. Men perpetrate the overwhelming majority of rapes and murders of strangers. These crimes are much more likely to leave behind DNA evidence that can rule out an innocent suspect, or point to the real rapist or killer. \n \n But when women kill, they usually kill someone close to them. And in most of those cases, DNA isn\'t relevant. When a woman is suspected of killing her husband or her child, investigators are likely to find her DNA all over the crime scene whether she\'s guilty or innocent—so DNA testing can do little to exonerate her. Sure enough, 27 percent of the men in the exonerations registry were freed using DNA evidence. The same was true of only 7.6 percent of the women. \n \n Yet many exoneration projects, including the original Innocence Project founded in 1992, only work with convicts who can be absolved through DNA. Because courts consider DNA tests definitive and trustworthy, genetic evidence is often the most effective way to overturn a wrongful conviction. Innocence projects have tended to avoid cases in which the offender knew the victim, because it can be hard to disentangle what happened in a domestic crime. In some cases, Daniel said, ""you almost have to look into that person\'s brain to know what happened."" About half the women in the registry went to prison for harming someone in their care. \n \n But reliance on DNA and aversion to domestic cases weren\'t the only hurdles for wrongly convicted women. In a whopping 63 percent of the women\'s cases, Daniel and Royal realized, it turned out that there was never a crime to begin with—the death was actually a suicide or an accident. That was true in only 21 percent of the men\'s cases. \n \n This was a critical discovery. The tools innocence projects rely on are designed to solve crimes. When DNA evidence isn\'t available, innocence investigators may seek to establish alibis, interview witnesses overlooked by police, undermine mistaken witness identifications, or track down alternative suspects with a history of similar crimes. Attorneys have a much easier time getting a wrongful conviction reopened when they can point to the real culprit. \n \n Yet if a woman is wrongly convicted for an accident that kills her child, there is no crime to solve, no ""real killer,"" and probably no alibi. \n \n Overturning convictions for crimes that were really accidents is difficult and time-consuming. Attorneys may have to prove that the prosecution misused or misunderstood forensic science or withheld crucial evidence. Proving that something was an accident may require attorneys to understand highly technical and controversial evidence on fire science, shaken-baby syndrome, toxicology, or rare medical conditions, and hire expensive expert witnesses to bolster their arguments. These hurdles disproportionately affect women: Daniel and Royal have found that 37 percent of the women (but around 20 percent of the men) in the exonerations registry were cleared because their original convictions used false or misleading forensic evidence. \n \n There was one more thing that set exonerated women apart: Daniel and Royal have come to believe that, in many cases in which women were freed because no crime had been committed, sexist stereotypes had been used to conjure up a motive. \n \n ""Almost every case has something like this,"" Daniel told me, recounting one trial in which a prosecutor suggested a mother had killed her son so she could pursue a career in modeling. ""That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,"" Daniel said. The woman spent years in prison before the real perpetrator came forward. \n \n When Harper, the woman blamed after a serial killer murdered her son, was on trial, the prosecution portrayed her variously as thirsty for revenge on her ex-husband or, pointing out her pursuit of a postgraduate degree, career-obsessed with no time for a child. Her ex-husband testified that Harper considered an abortion when she first became pregnant (which Harper denied). ""And that was used to show she was capable of murder,"" Royal said, noting that the trial—and jury selection—took place in a rural, heavily conservative county in Illinois. \n \n In the case of Kristine Bunch, the prosecutor said he didn\'t think the blaze burned Bunch badly enough. Wouldn\'t a mother walk through fire to save her child? He offered evidence that Bunch was a bad mother, telling the jury in his closing argument that she had asked a friend to take custody of Tony, even though the friend had denied this rumor in her testimony. Not to mention the judge\'s comments about Bunch\'s pregnancy. \n \n These sorts of narratives have ""nothing to do with whether the evidence shows that a person did what they\'re being accused of,"" said Andrea Louise Lewis, an attorney who works for Royal and Daniel. ""And these women get wrongfully convicted in these cases where nothing happened. Nothing criminal happened at all."" \n \n \n \n After Kristine Bunch gave birth to her second son, correctional officers put her in an ankle chain just long enough for her to reach the toilet in her hospital room. It had been three months since she went to prison. Bunch held her baby for a fleeting moment before her parents took him home with them. Then she made it her single-minded mission to find someone to help reopen her case. \n \n ""I realized, I\'m going to have to fight,"" Bunch recalled. She sent out hundreds of letters and received hundreds of rejections. \n \n Daniel and Royal have come to believe that in many cases sexist stereotypes had been used to conjure up a motive. \n \n While Bunch despaired in prison, new research emerged showing that the signatures of an accidental fire are easy to confuse with signs of arson; as a result, many old arson cases have been called into question. In a similar vein, child abuse investigators once took it as gospel that a baby with brain swelling and certain forms of internal bleeding had been violently shaken within the past several hours. But a new body of evidence suggests that infections, infant strokes, and accidental falls can also cause the telltale symptoms of shaken-baby syndrome (SBS). Meanwhile, child abuse researchers now believe that a symptom like brain bleeding can take days—not hours—to cause serious problems. If a child has several caregivers—a babysitter, relatives, and immediate family members—it can be impossible to say with certainty who abused her. \n \n But it\'s prosecutors who decide whether to file charges or fight appeals, and not all of them buy the new science. When I sent questions about wrongly convicted women to the National District Attorneys Association, I was referred to Josh Marquis, an NDAA board member and Oregon district attorney who is a strident skeptic of the innocence community. Daniel and Royal noted that a disproportionate number of women are exonerated because new science cast doubt on their original conviction—or even moved medical experts who once testified against them to change their minds. But Marquis said that he and many of his fellow prosecutors don\'t trust the developing science. New doubts about SBS, he said, are shared by only ""a very small group of doctors"" whose voices have been amplified by the defense bar. As for developments in arson science, he said, ""arson investigation is more of an art than a science."" \n \n It was only when Bunch connected with an Indianapolis attorney named Hilary Bowe Ricks, and scraped together a modest fee using her $1.30-a-day prison earnings, that she learned that new arson science could cast her conviction into doubt. In 2006, Ricks convinced the Northwestern center to join the case, and the team, which by then included Daniel, soon found a bevy of problems with the conviction. Bunch\'s original defense attorney had argued that one of the trailer home\'s many electrical problems probably caused the fire. Any accelerant, he insisted, was likely from a kerosene heater the family sometimes ran in the living room. However, state investigators working on-site (using now-questionable science) observed burn patterns in Tony\'s bedroom that fire experts at the time saw as undisputed evidence of arson. And a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives chemist who examined 10 samples sent to his Washington, DC, lab testified at Bunch\'s original trial that the floor of both the living room and the bedroom tested positive for liquid accelerant. \n \n Bunch\'s new legal team obtained the raw data that the ATF chemist had analyzed. According to lawsuits her attorneys have since filed against the investigators for withholding evidence, someone had altered the result for the sample in Tony\'s bedroom, which was negative for accelerant, making Bunch seem guilty. It appeared to Ricks as though investigators hadn\'t found accelerant anywhere in the trailer home, except in the living room, where the heater stood. \n \n The fire that had taken Tony\'s life now looked like an accident. (The state investigators have denied any wrongdoing, and an ATF spokeswoman declined to comment.) \n \n Bunch\'s legal team brought this undisclosed evidence to the Indiana Court of Appeals. On March 21, 2012, a three-judge panel reversed Bunch\'s conviction. The state Supreme Court affirmed the ruling in August, and she walked out of prison, a free woman for the first time in more than 16 years. By Christmas, prosecutors quietly declined to retry her. \n \n ""When you walk out, you\'re exonerated, and you\'re free and clear. But that hurt, that humiliation, that shame—it doesn\'t go away."" \n \n \n \n A few months after Bunch was released, Daniel and Royal launched Northwestern\'s Women\'s Project, an exoneration effort focused exclusively on freeing wrongly convicted women. They have already agreed to represent six women—cases that will involve child head trauma and arson science—and in December, they asked the Illinois Supreme Court to grant their first appeal. Meanwhile, their team is poring over files from dozens of suspicious convictions around the country and amassing court transcripts for an in-depth study of wrongful convictions of women accused of killing their children. \n \n Daniel and Royal\'s tiny project may wind up in the vanguard of work to exonerate both men and women. More wrongful convictions are overturned each year, but fewer and fewer of them involve DNA: Paul Cates, a spokesman for the Innocence Project, told me that investigators have now cleared many ""easy"" DNA cases—such as convictions that can be overturned by testing a single previously untested rape kit. Instead, more cases now involve complex DNA evidence, or none at all, and many more of those cases are ultimately found to involve an accident. Last year, a record 125 people were exonerated across the country; in 58 of those cases, courts found no crime was committed at all. \n \n Today, Kristine Bunch volunteers for the Women\'s Project, sorting through inmates\' letters. She reads each one carefully, remembering the decade she spent writing pleas just like theirs. ""You live with this freaky numbness,"" she said. ""It\'s almost like you\'re underwater and everything is in slow motion. And you can\'t seem to pull yourself up out of it."" \n \n She is thrilled that there is now an outfit giving convictions like hers its full attention, run by attorneys who understand that everything about a woman—her career, her ambitions, how much she cries—is ripe for judgment. In her off-hours, she is trying to get to know her 19-year-old son. Even though she saw him nearly every weekend in prison, she missed out on raising him, and building a strong relationship has proved difficult. \n \n So has the healing process. Many men who were wrongfully convicted didn\'t know their supposed victims. But with Bunch, the accident she was blamed for not only took 17 years of her life—it took her child. \n \n ""You\'re accused of this horrible, horrible crime, you\'re put away, you have newspapers saying horrible, horrible things about you,"" she said. ""When you walk out, you\'re exonerated, and you\'re free and clear. But that hurt, that humiliation, that shame—it doesn\'t go away because you\'ve been exonerated. It\'s hard to step back out and act like you\'re normal and part of the world.""', 'In what was easily her strongest debate performance in recent memory – and arguably her strongest since the campaign began – Hillary Clinton was calm, cool and collected at Thursday night’s debate. \n \n Clinton could’ve been understandably on edge, as she was fresh off a resounding loss in New Hampshire on Tuesday and an effective tie in Iowa the week before. But it was Sanders who was oddly on the defensive despite what has been momentum in his favor, starting out the night more combative than Clinton and wasting his time on petty one-liners. (When Clinton talked about building political capital when she’s in the White House, for instance, Sanders began a rebuttal with “Secretary Clinton, you’re not in the White House yet.”) \n \n Perhaps it was understandable that Sanders appeared to be on defensive as the major topics of the night – race, foreign policy and relations with Obama – are all considered areas of relative weakness for the income inequality-focused Sanders, though the the depth of his policy knowledge and ability to articulate it before audiences, particularly on race issues, has improved markedly since the campaign began. \n \n Still, as winning over minority voters will be one of the principal areas of focus for both candidates going into southern primaries like the one in South Carolina and polls show that Sanders is struggling to eat into Clinton’s lead in the coming contests, expectations were high for Sanders this debate. \n \n And while both candidates performed well initially in talking about systemic racism and reforming the criminal justice system, it was Sanders who stumbled when a moderator asked if race relations would be better handled under him than the current president. It was a foreseeable trap – asking a white man whether he’d do a better job on race issues than the first black president – but Sanders didn’t seem to see what he was walking into. \n \n “Absolutely,” he said in response to the moderator’s question before slipping into his classic stump speech. “Because what we will do is instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they’re not hanging out on street corners. We’re going to make sure those kids stay in school are able to get a college education.” \n \n It was as tone-deaf a line as any all night and, worse yet, it may have reminded Clinton of another line of attack she’d prepared in advance. In an MSNBC interview earlier on Thursday, Sanders had criticized President Obama’s failure to connect with Congress, saying in an interview with MSNBC, “There’s a huge gap right now between Congress and the American people. ... What presidential leadership is about [is] closing that gap.” \n \n From a political analyst’s perspective, it’s a completely valid criticism – but when you’re running in a Democratic primary with an extremely popular Democratic president, it is, well, a weird move. \n \n And Clinton didn’t let him – or the audience – forget about that or other critiques of the president, pivoting near the end of evening to Sander’s frequent criticism of Obama. “I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership” she said, “because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time.” \n \n Then, without changing her even tone in the slightest, Clinton launched her most vicious attack on Sanders of the debate, running down a list of the times Sanders had called the president “weak” and “a disappointment”. She ended with, “I don’t think [Obama] gets the credit he deserves.” \n \n The argument over Obama’s legacy is one that Clinton’s campaign has been wanting to have with Sanders for some time, and Sanders set her up for an easy hit. Viewers at home watching the candidates on a split screen could see Sanders huffing and puffing as Clinton spoke, laughing angrily to himself and scribbling notes as she spoke. He clearly hadn’t been expecting that line of attack, though he might well have anticipated it. When he finally did get time to respond, he told the woman whom he’d earlier all but accused of accepting campaign donations in direct exchange for political favors that repeating his own words “was a low blow”, indignantly and with no cool whatsoever. \n \n It was a bad look for Bernie – whom the cameras often caught wagging a finger at the moderators while Clinton spoke – and it left him struggling to articulate the reasons for the distance between himself and a popular president, a distance he’d previously tried to wave away before when an interview Obama gave to Politico seemed to suggest that the sitting president favors Clinton over Bernie. \n \n Throughout the debate, on practically every topic, Clinton’s cool demeanor played well. Even on the one topic that should have gotten under her skin – why more New Hampshire women, particularly young women, didn’t vote for her – she resisted the temptation to be or even sound critical. \n \n “I have spent my entire adult life making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices even if that choice is not to vote for me” she said, adding that she hoped that they’d vote their consciences in the primary and learn more about her before the general election. \n \n After Clinton surrogates like Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem made the mistake of being insufficiently deferential to younger women last week – possibly costing her at least a few votes – Clinton didn’t have a lot of room to err in her answer, and she didn’t. \n \n It was, instead, her opponent who made the mistake – repeatedly this debate – of being too quick to anger and allowing his feelings to affect his answers. Clinton, who can hardly express an emotion in public without her ability to lead being called into question, didn’t have that luxury, and she didn’t try to indulge in it. \n \n For once, that was an advantage.']",3,"– Exonerating women who are wrongfully convicted of violent crimes is no easy task—just ask Kristine Bunch. She got 60 years for supposedly setting the fire that killed her 3-year-old son in 1995, and struggled to find anyone who could help, Mother Jones reports. Finally, lawyers at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school exposed a glaring hole (and possibly corruption) in the arson investigators' case. That evidence got Bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, USA Today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the Center, Karen Daniel and Judy Royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: Women constitute roughly 11% of violent-crime convictions but only 6% of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a ""real culprit,"" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. ""That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,"" says Daniel. ""Almost every case has something like this.""

While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly. The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency, and Mitt Romney will win this race. \n \n In his acceptance speech, President Obama did not offer any solutions for the millions of Americans unemployed or underemployed. But his convention speech was not the only big letdown to voters, as Americans also dealt with yet another dismal jobs report last week. President Obama is the only president in modern American history to stand before the American people asking for re-election with this many Americans struggling to find work. The key numbers in this election are the 43 straight months of 8% or higher unemployment, the 23 million Americans struggling to find work, and the 47 million Americans who are on food stamps. \n \n Today, there is no question: Americans are not better off than we were four years ago, and that is why President Obama has struggled in this race. The truth is that some of President Obama’s allies are claiming victory, but others are acknowledging the unsustainable position in which they find themselves. This is evidenced in a recent quote in The New York Times by an Obama Administration official saying, “It’s certainly not what I would call the position we wanted to be in at this point in the race…He’s going to have to make the case that we wouldn’t even be at 8 percent if it weren’t for him.” \n \n Consider the following points: \n \n The Obama Economy: The stakes are very high in this election, and voters understand the future of our country is on the line. This may be lost on those living within the hyper-political world in and around the Beltway, but it is not lost in communities in battleground states. In short, the Romney-Ryan campaign understands Americans struggling in the Obama economy will determine the outcome of the race, and once the preponderance of information about the President’s failed policies – combined with Mitt Romney’s vision to strengthen the middle class – are communicated, our nation will move in a different direction. \n \n All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further. In eight states, Pollster.com’s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts the margin between the two candidates at less than three points, virtually guaranteeing a tight race.

In both states, Pollster.com’s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts Obama’s lead at only seven points in each of these states. In North Carolina, fresh off of hosting the Democratic National Convention, the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a stealth withdrawal. In a state the President won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008, all one has to do is look at the Obama campaign’s television buy in the state to understand how they view their chances there. The Obama campaign’s North Carolina television buy has dropped 35% compared to June, and they have run more than twice as much advertising over the past two weeks in Rochester, Minnesota (hitting a small slice of Iowa), than they have in any North Carolina market. \n \n Historical Data: Political campaign historians will recall President Jimmy Carter led Ronald Reagan by a near double digit margin late in the fall in 1980. In that race, the voters made their decision based on the key issues confronting the nation and it determined the outcome. On the economy, the most important issue of this race, Mitt Romney leads by 51%-45%, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll. \n \n Targeted Campaign: The Romney-Ryan campaign is running deeply local and targeted efforts in each of the states focusing on the voter groups that will make the difference on Election Day. Anyone asserting a “one-size-fits-all-campaign” effort is being put forward is simply misinformed, as evidenced by the 15 different ads released by the Romney Ryan campaign this past Friday and now running in nine states, including Wisconsin. \n \n New Money Advantage: All of this is not possible without resources, and the Romney-Ryan campaign and the Republican Party have a real advantage. In August alone, the Romney Victory effort raised more than $111 million, marking the third straight fundraising month of more than $100 million, putting us on a very strong financial footing for the final two months. \n \n Energy and Enthusiasm: CNN/ORC’s most recent polling shows that 62% of Republicans are “extremely” or “very” excited about this election, while only 56% of Democrats report being “extremely” or “very” excited. This Republican enthusiasm advantage has manifested itself in an unprecedented and historic grassroots effort that will have a significant impact on turnout in battleground states on Election Day. For instance, as of today, Victory volunteers have already knocked on more doors than during the entire 2008 campaign. (2.72 million in 2012 through September 8 compared to 2.43 million overall in 2008.) \n \n Romney’s Ground Game: During last weekend’s “Super Saturday,” we crossed the 20 million volunteer voter contact threshold. Also, the Romney campaign knocked on more doors last week than in any week during the 2008 campaign. More than 55,000 volunteers have knocked doors or made phone calls for Victory this year and that number is growing by the week. And volunteers have collected person-to-person identification information on nearly 1.7 million swing voters in battleground states thus far. And the numbers are even more startling when one looks at individual states. For instance, in Ohio alone, five times more phone calls and 28 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. This past Saturday, more than 100,000 doors were knocked on by Victory volunteers in the Buckeye State. And in Wisconsin, five times more phone calls and 72 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. And the list goes on and on. \n \n Mitt Romney will be the next President. The outcome of this race will ultimately be determined in favor of Governor Romney because he has the better leadership skills, the better record, and the better vision for where he wants to take the country. These advantages are being fueled by the commitment and determination of volunteers and voters to change direction and move our country on a path toward economic growth and job creation. In short, the combination of having the superior candidate, being in a margin-of-error race with an incumbent President, having a cash advantage, and having an unprecedented grassroots effort and a winning message on the economy ensure that Americans will make a change in leadership in Washington on November 6.', 'AP \n \n The Mitt Romney campaign circulated a statement Monday from its pollster, Neil Newhouse, conceding that President Barack Obama ""has seen a bounce from his convention"" in daily tracking polls but urging readers not to ""get too worked up about the latest polling."" \n \n Newhouse characterized the recent shift to Obama as ""a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions"" and argued that the ""basic structure of the race has not changed significantly"": \n \n All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further.

PPP has these polls that just put chum in the water for the media. Sometimes I think there\'s a conscious effort between the media and Chicago to get Republicans depressed. \n \n A poll tracking model created for HuffPost Pollster by political scientist Simon Jackman, based on all polling at the national and state levels, shows that the conventions have helped boost Obama\'s share of the vote to his highest levels since early March. The model currently has Obama leading Romney by 3 percentage points.', 'I asked a top Romney adviser what he makes of reports that the Romney campaign knows it’s losing and that Ohio is slipping out of reach (PPP has a new poll with Obama at 50 in the state): \n \n It’s horses**t.

And the more Washington DC controls our economy, the more important inside-the-beltway publications are and the more money they make. The 202 area code is dominated by people who will make more money if Obama is reelected, so it’s not just an ideological thumb they’re putting on the scale for him, it’s a business interest. \n \n I actually think the other side is in a panic. You look at New Mexico closing up. And they’re not above 50 in any of their target states. Look, we’re raising money, they’re raising money, and it’s tight. This is a dogfight.

39,"['The rate of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) nearly doubles in those who both smoke and drink compared to those who only smoke or drink, according to new research published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology.

All of which begs the question of how reliable these sayings are. Is there any evidence beyond the anecdotal that drinking wine followed by beer or vice versa makes hangovers worse? \n \n A review of previous research published in 2000 confirms that the causes of the main symptoms of hangovers are dehydration, changes in the levels of hormones such as aldosterone and cortisol, and the toxic effects of alcohol itself. In addition there’s evidence that the immune system is disrupted and that this could be the cause of the headache, the nausea and the fatigue. \n \n \n \n The first of the two main ingredients of a drink that affect the severity of a hangover is obvious. The higher the alcohol content, and the faster you drink it, the worse the hangover. This is however just an average. The same quantity of alcohol does not always result in the same severity of hangover. Many report that they don’t get hangovers and no one quite knows why. In a study of young Danes on holiday, almost a third of those who consumed at least 12 units of alcohol (roughly equivalent to four pints of lager or four 250ml glasses of wine) avoided hangovers. \n \n Mixing drinks needn’t necessarily increase the overall amount of alcohol consumed, but it may do with cocktails. If combining three or four measures of spirits alongside other ingredients, a throbbing head and dry throat is probably just the result of consuming more alcohol in total. \n \n Beyond the ethanol that triggers intoxication, the other key ingredients that affect hangovers are what the beverage industry calls congeners. These are the other substances produced during fermentation, such as acetone, acetaldehyde, fusel oil and the best-known, tannins, which give darker drinks their colour and part of their flavour. Bourbon whisky, for example, contains 37 times the quantity of congeners as vodka. \n \n To find out the effect of these substances on hangover severity, researchers in the US recruited university students who were regular drinkers, without alcohol problems. On different nights they were given either bourbon and cola, vodka and cola or a placebo which consisted of cola mixed with tonic, with a few drops of either bourbon or vodka to make it taste similar to the real stuff. They drank anything between three and six drinks, however much was enough to give them a concentration of 0.11g of alcohol per 100ml of breath. This would put them two to five times over the drink drive limit, depending which country they were in. They then spent the night in the clinic and were woken at 7am for breakfast before taking part in a battery of tests. For this they were paid a rather generous $450. The researchers found the students who drank bourbon rated their hangovers as worse, but interestingly they performed just as well on tasks such as reaction time tests. \n \n Clear drinks such as white rum, vodka and gin tend to cause fewer and less severe hangovers because they contain relatively low levels of congeners. Perhaps those who mix their drinks are more likely to choose a dark-coloured drink containing higher levels of these substances simply by virtue of their wider drinking range, but again it isn\'t the mixing in itself that causes the problem. \n \n No scientist seems to have done the perfect counter-balanced study where people are randomly assigned to drink beer followed by wine or wine followed by beer. But perhaps it’s not the grape or the grain that matters, but the effect that the strength of those drinks has on judgement. Beer is only between a third and half the strength of wine, so starting on it leads to less intoxication if followed by the stronger stuff. But if a person starts on wine or spirits, then their judgement may be impaired enough to drink more heavily later. There’s certainly evidence that people are not good at judging their own drunkenness. At low levels people overestimate the amount of alcohol in our blood, but after a few drinks they start to underestimate it. \n \n So, the existing evidence suggests that hangovers can\'t be blamed on mixing drinks. It\'s probably down to the high congener count of the booze, or over-drinking. As for hangover cures, scientists have looked into those too, and the British Medical Journal published a review of trials of everything from borage to artichoke and glucose to prickly pears in 2005. The bad news for drinkers is that none of them work. \n \n Do you agree? If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook or Google+ page, or message us on Twitter.']",2,"– Many of us may avoid downing hard alcohol, wine, and beer on the same night for fear of a raging hangover the next day. But at the BBC, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, Claudia Hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. (As for ""beer before liquor, never been sicker""? It appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference.) ""The existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks,"" Hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: Congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, Hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: A study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, Science Daily reported. (If you do find yourself with a hangover, you may want to reach for a Sprite.)"
40,"['BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Scientists from the U.S. and Denmark are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earth\'s crust that\'s responsible for the famous Old Faithful geyser and other hydrothermal features at Yellowstone National Park. \n \n Throughout November the research team will conduct flights over the park using a giant, hoop-shaped electromagnetic system suspended from a helicopter. The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface. \n \n The team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes massive hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park, said lead scientist Carol Finn with the U.S. Geological Survey. \n \n One such explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles (2.6 km) across beneath at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake. It\'s believed to be the largest such crater in the world. \n \n Similar to the regular eruptions of Old Faithful, hydrothermal explosions occur when huge pockets of boiling water beneath the ground experience a sudden drop in pressure, causing the water to convert to steam and explode violently to the surface. \n \n Similar work elsewhere in the U.S. has helped reveal hazards from volcanoes. \n \n ""Nobody knows anything about the flow paths"" for the hot water that erupts from Yellowstone\'s geysers, Finn said. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" \n \n The electromagnetic system was developed in Denmark to map out groundwater supplies in Denmark. It\'s able to discern between water and rocks to a depth of about 1,500 feet beneath the surface. \n \n In Yellowstone, a better understanding of the hydrothermal plumbing could help administrators plot out future development so tourists can enjoy the park\'s features without damaging them or being put into harm\'s way. \n \n The study is a collaboration between the U.S.G.S., Yellowstone National Park, the University of Wyoming and Denmark\'s Aarhus University.', 'This week, a survey will begin to map the underground hydrothermal features of Yellowstone National Park for the first time. \n \n The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Aarhus University in Denmark and the University of Wyoming, will use a helicopter carrying electromagnetic technology that resembles a giant hula hoop to record tiny voltage signals. \n \n The data will be able to tell the scientists if they are flying over solid earth, “rotten” sulfuric rock, or water. Carol Finn, one of the scientists on the surveying team, said she has been looking forward to this for ten years. \n \n “This is really kind of a last frontier if you will, in Yellowstone, of being able to look at a large part that’s underground that people that people have not looked at,” said Finn. “This survey can visualize the geology and the water down to about 500 meters, so 1500 feet.” \n \n The goal of the project is to fill in the gaps of knowledge about what causes geysers like Old Faithful and hydrothermal explosions by locating where all that heated water flows underground. \n \n “There’s just a lot we don’t know and this survey is really exciting because it’s going to be the first view of a large portion of the groundwater system, of the water underground that feeds all of these thermal features,” said Finn. \n \n The survey will also provide information that could help the park in the future by locating unstable ground. The researchers will fly the helicopter along the Mammoth-Norris corridor and take at least four weeks to complete.']",2,"– The mysteries of Old Faithful may soon be solved, thanks, in part, to something that looks like a giant hula hoop. American and Danish scientists have this week begun an aerial survey of Yellowstone that actually looks well into the earth, ""visualizing"" the geology and water as much as 1,500 feet below the surface, says Carol Finn. She's waited a decade to explore what she calls ""a last frontier ... in Yellowstone,"" and the intention is to better map the flow of water that's feeding Old Faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions. Over a four-week period, a helicopter will fly above, armed with electromagnetic technology that looks like a giant hula hoop. The AP explains it in layman's terms: ""The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface."" Scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, ""rotten"" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per Wyoming Public Media. But a press release frames the main quest like so: We know that the water that explodes from Yellowstone's geysers ""originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface."" We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" asks Finn. Right now, ""nobody knows."" (Archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a Mayan temple.)"
41,"['Once they sense danger, fruit flies can pitch their bodies like a fighter jet during flight, rolling almost upside down in order to shift momentum and speed to avoid a oncoming threat, new research shows. \n \n “We discovered that fruit flies alter course in less than one one-hundredth of a second, 50 times faster than we blink our eyes, which is faster than we ever imagined.” Michael Dickinson, UW professor of biology and co-author of the paper about these findings, said in a news release. \n \n In his lab, Dickinson and other researchers have found that evasive maneuvers performed by fruit flies, also known as Drosophila hydei, are very similar to those of a fighter jet. His research will be published in the April 11 issue of Science. \n \n Escape Maneuver in a Flying Fly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n More like a plane than a boat \n \n “One of the fastest things a fruit fly does is take information from its eyes and react accordingly,” Dickinson said. \n \n Previous research suggested that flies would turn like a boat would, Dickinson said, but this new research has shown that they can pitch their body and perform banked turns much like a plane would. \n \n “They do this with remarkably subtle changes in wing movement,” Dickinson told us. \n \n Florian Muijres, lead author of the paper and postdoctoral researcher, said that it’s both the speed and accuracy of the flies that they have found impressive. \n \n “What we have found is that these flies are fast and accurate in their response,” Muijres said. \n \n According to Muijres, the flies can roll almost completely upside down while flying thanks to the incredible speed at which they flap their wings. \n \n “These flies normally flap their wings 200 times a second and, in almost a single wing beat, the animal can reorient its body to generate a force away from the threatening stimulus and then continues to accelerate,” Muijres said in the UW release. \n \n The fly’s brain may be small, but it’s very dense with neurons. Muijres said a fly’s brain is actually more dense than a human brain. The mystery of how these little creatures are able to perform such amazing feats is still pushing the researchers at UW forward with their research. \n \n “We have the input and the output and now we are looking at how the input translates into the output,” Muijres said. \n \n Using tech to slow down time \n \n UW researchers used three high speed cameras to accurately capture the flies’ movements in a 20-by-20 centimeter flight arena. They used an expanding shadow effect to make the fly take evasive action, and the cameras recorded the action at 7,500 frames per second. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly SetupNrobofly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Because the camera shutters were opening and closing every one thirty-thousandth of a second, they need to light the flight arena so the cameras would be able to get the footage. Dickinson said they used infra-red light in order to light the space for the cameras without blinding the flies in the process. \n \n “When the flies would go through the focus of all three cameras is when we would start recording,” Dickinson said. \n \n Once the measurements and video were recorded, the scientists were able to replicate the fly’s movement on a robot fly model. \n \n “We are able to take the measurements and replay them on the robot and directly measure the forces the wings were generating,” Dickinson said. \n \n Amazing brains \n \n Dickinson said a fruit fly’s brain performs very complicated calculations in a split second, an amazing level of calculation for something so small. \n \n “How can such a small brain generate so many remarkable behaviors? A fly with a brain the size of a salt grain has the behavioral repertoire nearly as complex as a much larger animal such as a mouse.

Scientists who had the insects wing it through two laser beams watched the bugs make hairpin turns at blazing fast speeds, by banking in the same way that fighter jet planes do. The findings, published in the journal Science, shed light on these tiny critters’ remarkable ability to evade predators (and fly swatters). \n \n [Updated at 5:15 p.m. PDT April 10: Tracking how these insects fly in response to a threat should help researchers understand the fruit fly\'s inner life, said Cornell University physicist Jane Wang, who was not involved in the research. \n \n ""The insects turn because they have some internal control circuitry, just like a pilot [who\'s] turning a plane,"" Wang said. ""And by looking how the insects turn, we might be able to say what the \'pilot\' is thinking.""] \n \n When trying to escape from a threat, the Drosophila hydei flies turn at a speed that’s five times faster than their normal turning speed, according to researchers from the University of Washington. Instead of turning right or left on the ""yaw"" axis, like a boat in the water, the flies execute banked turns, by rolling and pitching their bodies at the same time, which supercharges their turns. They can execute one of these within less than one hundredth of a second after seeing a threat, the scientists said. That’s 50 times faster than the blink of an eye. \n \n “A lot of other people working in the field … would not have predicted the fly could rotate itself so quickly,” said study coauthor Michael Dickinson, a neurobiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. \n \n Dickinson and his colleagues captured 3,566 wing beats involved in 92 separate fruit fly escapes, which was no easy task. To capture such infinitesimally tiny movements, the scientists had to use high-speed cameras that took 7,500 frames per second -- that’s nearly 40 frames for each wing beat. They also needed flood the flight area with light to capture the motions in high detail -- but all that light would blind the flies, which wouldn’t be able to maneuver. \n \n Instead, they had to use infrared light, whose wavelength is too long for human or fly eyes to pick up on. All the circuitry in those lights generated so much heat that the scientists had to run an air conditioner in the laboratory, forcing the researchers to dress warmly in already chilly Seattle weather. \n \n There were, Dickinson said, “a whole lot of wool hats worn in the lab.” \n \n The scientists watched the flies fly through two crossing laser beams, causing their own shadow to loom large like an impending threat. In response, the flies quickly executed their escape maneuvers, which the scientists were able to capture on camera. \n \n The videos showed that the flies could roll to one side by 90 degrees or even more as they made these turns, almost bringing them upside down. And they could make these turns in less than two wing beats -- which is pretty remarkable, given that they typically flap their wings at 200 times per second, the scientists said. \n \n “So it’d kind of be like a jet fighter pilot with a stick in his or her hand, only had to make a little bit of tiny change in the stick and pshooo, the plane goes off,” Dickinson said. “So we’re very interested in how the brain can control motion on such a fine scale.” \n \n With all this high quality data, the scientists were able to pull out mathematical rules that governed the flies’ decisions on how to make a banked turn, and they then programmed them into a robotic fly that they tested in flowing mineral oil. (Because the robot was much bigger than the flies, the scientists had to adjust the viscosity of the fluid they were ""flying"" through so the physics would stay about the same, the scientists said.) \n \n The next step, Dickinson said, is to understand the complex neural circuitry linked to the flight muscles that makes these daring maneuvers possible. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Hallelujah!

42,"['Babies cry more in Britain, Canada, Italy and Netherlands than in other countries – proved for first time by new research by the University of Warwick. \n \n Psychologists have created world’s first universal charts for normal amount of crying in babies during first three months \n \n in babies during first three months On average, babies around the world cry for around 2 hours per day in first two weeks, peak at 2 hours 15 mins at six weeks - and crying reduces to 1 hour 10 minutes by week twelve \n \n In Denmark, Germany and Japan, parents deal with the least amount of crying and fussing \n \n Babies cry more in Britain, Canada and Italy, than the rest of the world – according to new research by the University of Warwick. \n \n Professor Dieter Wolke in the Department of Psychology and the Warwick Medical School has formulated the world’s first universal charts for the normal amount of crying in babies during the first three months. \n \n In a meta-analysis of studies involving almost 8700 infants – in countries including Germany, Denmark, Japan, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK – Professor Wolke calculated the average of how long babies fuss and cry per twenty-four hours across different cultures in their first twelve weeks. \n \n On average, it was found that babies cry for around two hours per day in the first two weeks. Crying generally peaks at around two hours fifteen minutes per day at six weeks – and reduces gradually to an average of 1 hour 10 minutes by the twelve week mark. \n \n However, some infants were found to cry as little as 30 minutes - and others over 5 hours - in twenty-four hours. \n \n Babies cry the most in the UK, Italy, Canada, and the Netherlands – and the lowest levels of crying were found in Denmark, Germany and Japan. \n \n The highest levels of colic – defined as crying more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 days a week in a baby– were found in the UK (28% of infants at 1-2 weeks), Canada (34.1% at 3-4 weeks of age) and Italy (20.9% at 8-9 weeks of age). \n \n In contrast, lowest colic rates were reported in Denmark (5.5% at 3-4 weeks) and Germany (6.7% at 3-4 weeks). \n \n The current definitions for determining whether a baby is crying too much and suffering from colic, are the Wessel criteria, which were formulated in the 1950s. \n \n As childcare and the family unit has largely transformed over the last half century and across different cultures, new universal guidelines were needed for modern parents and health professionals to assess normal and excessive levels of crying in babies. \n \n Professor Wolke comments on what the research will lead to: \n \n “Babies are already very different in how much they cry in the first weeks of life – there are large but normal variations. We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy experiences or genetics. \n \n “The new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialised countries will help health professionals to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first 3 months or shows excessive crying which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents.” \n \n The research, ‘Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Fussing and Crying Durations and Colic Prevalence in Infants’ is published in The Journal of Pediatrics. \n \n 3 April 2017', 'Professor Dieter Wolke, who led the research, said: “German and Danish parents are much less likely to get worked up and they will wait a little bit before they intervene to see if the baby can self-sooth. \n \n “They don’t get all worried about it.” \n \n Across all the countries examined for the survey, babies cried for an average of two hours per day in the first two weeks after birth. \n \n Crying peaked at about two hours and 15 minutes each day at six weeks of age, before gradually reducing to an average of one hour and 10 minutes. \n \n Previous research has indicated that around 40 per cent of infant crying is inconsolable, and Professor Wolke said many new mothers and fathers are unduly stressed by some “unscientific” parenting books which offer bogus solutions. \n \n Concern in Britain over crying babies costed the NHS an estimated £70 million each year, he said, with stressed-out parents less more likely to reinforce a pattern of crying. \n \n “It’s the same principal as going on a plane,” he said. \n \n “You are told to put your own oxygen mask on before helping others. \n \n “If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby.” \n \n But he added that adult well-being surveys consistently put Denmark as one of the happiest countries in the world and that Danish babies may enjoy some “genetic bias” whereby they cry less. \n \n “The new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialised countries will help health care professions to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first three months or shows excessive crying which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents,” he said.']",2,"– New research into the amount of time that infants in various countries spend crying found that the littlest ones in usually placid Canada were the most colicky. British babies came in second, followed by Italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in Denmark and Germany. Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, psychologists at the University of Warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic—a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition—by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in Canada, reports the Guardian, where 34.1% of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the UK, the tally was 28% and in Italy 20.9%. Relatively blissful Danish babes scored 5.5%, with Germany at 6.7%. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. ""They don’t get all worried about it,"" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of ""genetic bias"" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys. In any case, new parents should learn to chill. ""If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby,"" Wolke says. (Crying saved this baby's life.)"
43,"['falls A lot of luck: How teen survived parachuting accident Jan. 28, 2014 at 7:32 PM ET \n \n Tweet email \n \n When Texas teen Mackenzie Wethington survived a parachuting accident Saturday, her father Joe called the 16-year-old “a miracle.” Doctors who treat traumatic injuries aren’t disagreeing. \n \n “Considering the bone and soft tissue damage that would occur from a fall from this height, the fact that she is alive and seemingly doing well really is quite miraculous, ’ said Dr. Michael Anderson, a pediatric critical care specialist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. \n \n \n \n Wethington is one lucky teen. The trauma surgeon who first treated Mackenzie in the ER didn\'t expect her to survive. ""I\'m glad to be wrong about that,"" Dr. Jeffrey Bender of the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in Oklahoma City said Tuesday at a news conference. \n \n Currently, Wethington is awake and breathing on her own and is listed in fair condition. “We see worse injuries routinely from car and ATV accidents,” said trauma surgeon Dr. Jason Lees, who is part of the Oklahoma team treating Wethington. “There’s a reason we wear parachutes when we step out of a plane.” \n \n Amazingly, Wethington, who suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken teeth and multiple fractures throughout her body, is expected to fully recover within about six to eight weeks, Bender said Tuesday. Her injuries are ""consistent with someone hit by a car going 40-50 mph,"" although that doesn\'t mean she hit the ground at that speed, he said. \n \n According to the World Health Organization, falls are the second leading cause of accidental or unintentional injury deaths worldwide. Each year an estimated 424,000 individuals die from falls globally. And it doesn’t have to be a 3,500-foot mishap. \n \n \n \n “A person can take a fall from a standing height and the neck can break, so this young girl is exceptionally fortunate in how the circumstances and force of the fall dissipated throughout her body,” said Dr. Ryan Goodwin, director of the Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Orthopedics at the Cleveland Clinic. “She is young, and in seeming good health, so she has that going for her.” But, he adds, she also had a lot of luck and physics on her side, too. \n \n \n \n When an individual falls from a great height, survival often depends on a lot of luck, as well as air resistance, or drag. \n \n “You can think of a fall as a form of energy,” explained James Kakalios, the Taylor Distinguished Professor in the school of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota. “Basically, if a person steps out of a plane you have no velocity. Gravity will start to pull you down and you accelerate.” \n \n \n \n But as you gain speed, air resistance comes into play and acts as a kind of brake slowing you down and reducing the amount of kinetic energy, or in other words, the force in which your body slams into the ground, said Kakalios, author of the Physics of Superheroes. \n \n He thinks the teen may have done some things accidentally to increase air drag, slowing her fall, and leading to a potentially softer, yet still serious, landing. \n \n “She’s creating a lot of turbulence as she falling, and therefore she’s maximizing the time it takes for her to hit the ground,” he said, citing that reducing the rate in which an object, or person, comes to a stop is critical for safety. “That’s why we have airbags,” Kakalios said, citing other instances of people surviving long falls such as I- 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis in which 13 people were killed, but 145 survived the 115-foot fall and the case of man who survived after he fell 500 feet from a New York skyscraper. \n \n “It’s noteworthy that people don’t usually survive these things, but some people do in the right set of circumstances,” he said. “Many people buy lottery tickets and don’t win, but there’s always someone who does win.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tweet email', 'Paramount Pictures Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker in \'Flight.\' \n \n Four years after Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic and became a global hero, the humorist James Thurber published a New Yorker magazine piece, ""The Greatest Man in the World,"" about a fictional pilot named Jack ""Pal"" Smurch. Mr. Thurber\'s aviator flew around the world nonstop in a rickety airplane he had built, then revealed himself to be a braggart, a fool and a generally despicable human being. The airline pilot played by Denzel Washington, Whip Whitaker, is far from despicable—he is, after all, played by Denzel Washington—but he\'s no Chesley Sullenberger, either. ""Flight,"" which was directed by Robert Zemeckis, soars when Whip is at the controls, struggling to save a seemingly doomed airplane. When he\'s back on the ground and struggling with himself, the film takes a surprising turn into a drama of addiction and moral exploration. One unwelcome surprise is how shopworn the story\'s components prove to be. Still, they\'re enhanced if not redeemed by Mr. Washington\'s stirring portrait of a skillful, prideful pilot hitting bottom. \n \n White-knuckle fliers may want to pass on ""Flight"" altogether, though they\'ll be missing an early sequence that\'s right up there with the best of the incipient-disaster genre: Think ""Airplane!"" without the laughs. What\'s unclear is whether Whip, who shouldn\'t even be sitting in the cockpit, will be up to the challenge. What\'s abundantly clear from the outset of the midair crisis is that a cascade of malfunctions will make his airplane uncontrollable. (However wildly over the top the sequence may seem to be, it\'s only a heightening of what actually happened off the California coast in 2000 when a loose jackscrew jammed the horizontal stabilizer of an Alaska Airlines MD-83, sending the airplane into a dive from which the pilots tried, unsuccessfully, to recover by flying upside down.) \n \n Crisis has been a major food group for many of the characters Mr. Washington has played; he\'s such a quick-witted star, with his flashing smile and mercurial spirit, that he ingests danger gleefully and thrives on it. Not this time, though. It\'s a shock to see the shape he\'s in—overweight, unkempt, a star stripped of his charisma for a role that keeps him in a garishly unflattering light. And Whip\'s experience and demonstrable skill may not be enough to save him, even though he\'s first hailed as a hero. Too many secrets threaten to bring him down in the investigation that follows his fateful flight. \n \n Watch a clip from the Robert Zemeckis film ""Flight."" An airline pilot (Denzel Washington) saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling. Also starring Nadine Velazquez. (Photo & Video: Paramount) \n \n When movie stars choose roles that make them unattractive, they\'re often praised for their courage, even though doing so can amount to adventurous career management. I\'d rather praise Mr. Washington for the eloquence, solemnity and disarming humor of his performance as a man whose body and soul are beset by the contending forces of probity and deceit, a good man whose addictions to drugs and booze have turned him into a shameless liar. \n \n That said, the script, by John Gatins, brings mixed blessings at best. Instead of hurtling to a climax, the story moves in fits and starts, loses momentum, injects itself with cockeyed comedy—John Goodman\'s Falstaffian drugmeister is the damnedest deus ex machina you\'ve ever seen—lumbers through 12-step thickets and finally resolves into an old-fashioned morality play. Mr. Zemeckis\'s direction is similarly a mixture of thrilling action, incisive characterization, overblown set pieces—the federal crash investigation is staged like a full-scale congressional hearing—and shameless, though effective, melodrama. The cast includes Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood, both of whom give the movie\'s star valuable support, and Kelly Reilly, who, as another addict in Whip\'s life, turns tepid writing into passionate humanity. \n \n Watch a clip from the Disney animated film ""Wreck-It Ralph."" A video game villain (John C. Reilly) wants to be a hero, but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives. Also with Jane Lynch & Sarah Silverman. (Photo & Video: Disney) \n \n \'Wreck-It Ralph\' \n \n Can it be that three decades have passed since video arcade games such as Pac-Man and Donkey Kong first unleashed their jumpy, choppy, charmingly blocky characters on a pop-eyed public? Disney\'s latest animated feature evokes nostalgia for that bygone era of barebones 8-bit technology and simple gameplay rules with a genially simple scheme. Just as Pixar\'s ""Toy Story"" trilogy revealed the secret life of toys, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" follows characters from a game called ""Fix-It Felix, Jr.,"" a takeoff on Donkey Kong. On duty, they\'re exuberant primitives. Off duty, they\'re fully drawn creatures in a 3-D world. Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, is the game\'s bad guy, a sensitive hulk who wants desperately to win a medal as a good guy. To that end, he flees his console\'s confines, travels around the arcade electronically and patches himself, with chaotic consequences, into a succession of modern high-definition games. It\'s a lovely pretext for dazzling visuals, yet the production is diminished by the clumsiness of an 8-bit script. \n \n That\'s a major or a minor matter, depending on how addicted you may have been to those early games, many of whose characters make cameo appearances; whether the film will connect with today\'s young kids is a major matter soon to be resolved. The story begins promisingly, with Ralph in an envious funk. He has always been compelled to wreck things—the rules of his game are inviolable—while Felix (Jack McBrayer) has always gotten praise for fixing things with his magic hammer. A 12-step group for bad guys doesn\'t do much for Ralph\'s bruised psyche, so the first stop on his pilgrimage is, logically enough, a game called ""Hero\'s Duty."" There he impersonates a robot and meets Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a shrill and glitchy character—she suffers from visual static—who has been evicted from her own game of ""Sugar Rush."" \n \n Enlarge Image Close Disney Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz \n \n The film was directed by Rich Moore, in his feature debut, and written by Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston. Its narrative core concerns the fraught friendship of Ralph and Vanellope, which in turn poses the question of whether a bad guy can really transform himself into a good guy. (Spoiler alert: Yes, he can.) But character gets trampled as the action goes turbo, Vanellope\'s voice grows ever more shrill and we find ourselves trapped, along with Ralph, in a Sugar Rush surround of oppressively pretty colors and numbingly repetitive races and chases. A further question posed by ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is whether brilliant animation alone can sustain a film that comes up short in dramatic development. (Spoiler alert: No, it can\'t.) \n \n Watch a clip from the film ""This Must Be the Place."" Cheyenne (Sean Penn), a retired rock star, returns to New York to find the man responsible for a humiliation suffered by his recently deceased father during WWII. (Photo & Video: Weinstein Co.) \n \n \'This Must Be the Place\' \n \n Sean Penn stars as Cheyenne, a burned-out American rock star living in Dublin and trapped in a second, passive childhood, plus full Goth regalia. At several points Cheyenne says ""Something\'s not quite right here: I don\'t know exactly what it is, but something…."" Before I get to what that something might be, let me touch on several relatively right things about this remarkably lifeless film, which Paolo Sorrentino directed from a script he wrote with Umberto Contarello. \n \n Mr. Penn\'s performance, depressed by the nature of his sad-clown character, is self-regarding in ways that are simultaneously dismaying and fascinating. The music, by David Byrne and Will Oldham, is exceptionally varied and characteristically rich. The cinematographer, Luca Bigazzi, finds one striking vista after another when Cheyenne leaves Dublin and criss-crosses the U.S. \n \n Enlarge Image Close The Weinstein Company Sean Penn and Frances McDormand \n \n What\'s wrong here, ludicrously and groanworthily wrong, is the reason for Cheyenne\'s criss-crossings. He is, it develops, on a hunt for the Nazi war criminal who did some unspecified something to his late father during the Holocaust. As juxtapositions go, regressed Goth rock star and Holocaust could hardly be more bizarre, and bizarre can be good when it\'s done deftly. In this case, however, it\'s done ponderously and sententiously. The movie\'s title is taken from the classic Talking Heads song, which is subtitled ""Naive Melody.""

Mackenzie Wethington, who went skydiving Saturday as a birthday present from her parents, slammed into the ground, yet somehow only suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken bones, and a broken tooth; she's already communicating with her parents in writing and doctors say she's in good condition and should suffer few long-term effects. ""I have no idea how she survived,"" one tells Today. Experts are calling it a miracle; one suspects the teen somehow decreased her air speed and thus landed somewhat more softly—in other words, she was incredibly lucky. The teen was supposed to do a tandem jump with an experienced skydiver, but was told when she arrived that Pegasus Air Sports Center wasn't doing tandem jumps, so her first jump after six hours of training was on her own—and went horribly awry. It's not clear exactly what happened: According to MyFox DFW, the family says Mackenzie's primary parachute didn't open properly (it was supposed to open automatically) and may have gotten tangled, and Mackenzie couldn't open the emergency chute. Mackenzie's dad (who says the main chute only half-opened, according to CNN) blames Pegasus Air Sports Center, claiming it offered inadequate training and didn't properly maintain its equipment. The owner of Pegasus, however, blames Mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment: ""She didn't do what she was supposed to do,"" he says, though it's not clear what she did wrong; the owner says she didn't take a ""corrective counter action"" to make her parachute ""stop turning."" He claims the chute did open fully but somehow, ""maybe ... initiated by her,"" started a rotation that caused the problem. The family has hired a lawyer, Fox News Insider reports."

They say they\'ve been left with no choice but to file a petition in order to ""honor the memory of their father, protect his legacy, and prevent his testamentary intentions from being undermined by avarice and overreaching of his third wife, Tanya Callau."" \n \n Thicke died suddenly in December at age 69, after his aorta ruptured while playing hockey with his son Carter. \n \n The older sons claim their father acquired the vast majority of his wealth long before meeting Callau, who signed a prenuptial agreement ahead of their 2005 marriage. \n \n In the trust, Thicke left each of his three children equal shares of a Carpinteria ranch, 75 percent of his personal effects and 60 percent of his remaining estate, according to the petition. He left Callau the ranch\'s furnishings, 25 percent of his personal effects, a $500,000 life insurance policy, all of his death benefits from pensions and union memberships and 40 percent of his remaining estate. He also provided that she could live at the ranch, as long as she paid for its expenses and maintained the property. \n \n Now, Thicke\'s sons claim Callau is insisting that the prenup she signed is invalid. \n \n According to the petition filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Thicke updated his trust from time to time, and the most recent iteration was signed in February 2016. It designated his brother Todd as the trustee, and left the estate in the hands of his children if Todd declined the role — which he did. Brennan and Robin say Callau made no complaints about the prenuptial agreement or the estate plan at that time. \n \n ""Now that Alan is dead, Tanya claims there are numerous problems with the Trust and the Prenuptial Agreement,"" writes attorney Alex Weingarten in the petition.

""The only thing they care about is protecting the legacy of their father and honoring his intentions. That is exactly what we are going to do."" \n \n The widow\'s attorney Adam Streisand sent THR a statement Tuesday evening. ""Tanya Thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public and she never has,"" he says. ""It is clear that Alan’s sons have chosen this distasteful public smear tactic to bully Tanya, by stirring up the tabloid media, filing a bogus lawsuit, and refusing family mediation.

Robin Thicke and brother Brennan, the oldest of Thicke's three sons, say that Tanya Callau—who wed Thicke in 2005—is threatening them with bad publicity unless they give her more of Thicke's estate. Thicke left much of his estate to his three children, but Callau still inherited a significant amount (the Hollywood Reporter has the exact breakdown) and was allowed to continue living on his Carpinteria, Calif., ranch. Thicke's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting Callau, and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying Thicke. They also say she had no issues with the prenup or the estate plan the last time Thicke updated his trust, in February 2016. (He died in December.) But now, Thicke's sons claim, Callau is claiming the prenup is invalid and there are problems with the trust. Per a petition the brothers filed in a Los Angeles court this week, the brothers say Callau also claims she has community rights to more of Thicke's assets, she should be reimbursed for any improvements she makes to the ranch while living there, and that she took a step back from her own career to support Thicke and help raise his youngest son. The brothers' attorney says in the filing that Callau has ""threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands,"" leading the brothers to ask a court to enforce the prenup and Thicke's will, TMZ reports. Callau's rep says in a statement, ""Tanya Thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public."""
45,"['A 1,112-y tree-ring record of moisture shows that in opposition to conventional wisdom, the climate during the rise of the 13 th -century Mongol Empire was a period of persistent moisture, unprecedented in the last 1,000 y. This 15-y episode of persistent moisture likely led to a period of high grassland productivity, contributing fuel to the Mongol Empire. We also present evidence that anthropogenic warming exacerbated the 21st-century drought in central Mongolia. These results indicate that ecosystems and societies in semiarid regions can be significantly affected by unusual climatic events at the decadal time scale. \n \n Abstract \n \n Although many studies have associated the demise of complex societies with deteriorating climate, few have investigated the connection between an ameliorating environment, surplus resources, energy, and the rise of empires. The 13th-century Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous land empire in world history. Although drought has been proposed as one factor that spurred these conquests, no high-resolution moisture data are available during the rapid development of the Mongol Empire. Here we present a 1,112-y tree-ring reconstruction of warm-season water balance derived from Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) trees in central Mongolia. Our reconstruction accounts for 56% of the variability in the regional water balance and is significantly correlated with steppe productivity across central Mongolia. In combination with a gridded temperature reconstruction, our results indicate that the regional climate during the conquests of Chinggis Khan’s (Genghis Khan’s) 13th-century Mongol Empire was warm and persistently wet. This period, characterized by 15 consecutive years of above-average moisture in central Mongolia and coinciding with the rise of Chinggis Khan, is unprecedented over the last 1,112 y. We propose that these climate conditions promoted high grassland productivity and favored the formation of Mongol political and military power. Tree-ring and meteorological data also suggest that the early 21st-century drought in central Mongolia was the hottest drought in the last 1,112 y, consistent with projections of warming over Inner Asia. Future warming may overwhelm increases in precipitation leading to similar heat droughts, with potentially severe consequences for modern Mongolia.', 'Image copyright National Palace Museum Image caption Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongol empire, which historians say was the largest contiguous empire in history \n \n The rise of Genghis Khan and the huge Mongol Empire in the early 13th Century may have been helped by good weather, scientists suggest. \n \n American researchers studying the rings of ancient trees in central Mongolia have discovered that his rise coincided with the mildest, wettest weather in more than 1,000 years. \n \n Grass grew at a rapid rate, providing fodder for his war horses. \n \n Genghis Khan united the Mongol tribes to invade and rule a vast area. \n \n It covered modern-day Korea, China, Russia, eastern Europe, India and south-east Asia. \n \n Charismatic leader \n \n The research shows that the years before Genghis Khan\'s rule were characterised by severe drought from 1180 to 1190, the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. \n \n Image caption Present-day Mongolians regard Genghis Khan as the founding father of their country \n \n But as the empire expanded from from 1211 to 1225, Mongolia saw an unusual spell of regular rainfall and mild temperatures. \n \n ""The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,"" study co-author and West Virginia University tree-ring scientist Amy Hessl told the AFP news agency. \n \n ""It wasn\'t the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. \n \n ""Where it\'s arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower.

This would probably remain of note only in tree-ring-studying circles if not for one other thing: Those dates happen to coincide with the rise of none other than Genghis Khan, reports the BBC. And the researchers say it's no coincidence. They argue in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the change in weather from severe drought conditions prior to 1211 to fertile ones afterward directly helped Khan build his empire. Think rain—specifically the lush grasslands it created to fuel to Khan's horse-driven army, along with the livestock his soldiers needed to survive. ""It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army, and concentrate power,"" West Virginia University researcher Amy Hessl tells National Geographic.

46,"['george washington Washington the ‘Blackest’ Name in America \n \n On the eve of George Washington\'s birthday, Associated Press writer Jesse Washington investigates why the founding father\'s surname now belongs predominantly to African-Americans. The 2000 U.S. Census counted 163,036 people with the last name Washington, 90 percent of whom were black — a far higher percentage than any other name. Writes Washington: \n \n \n \n The story of how Washington became the ""blackest name"" begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname. \n \n By choosing the name, he says, Reconstruction-era blacks might have been showing pride in the nation\'s history, as George Washington, who died in 1799, was still hugely popular at the time. Alternately, the name could have been a way to maintain ties to plantation owners who continued to be powerful regional figures after the Civil War. Then again, ""It\'s a myth,"" writes Washington, ""that most enslaved blacks bore the last name of their owner."" \n \n For instance, ""only a handful"" of George Washington\'s slaves had his name. According to Mary Thompson, a historian at Washington\'s Mount Vernon plantation, the president recorded most as having only a first name — and despite the abolitionist writings he left behind, he owned hundreds of slaves. ""Washington was leading this schizoid life,"" says biographer Ron Chernow. ""In theory and on paper he was opposed to slavery, but he was still zealously tracking and seeking to recover his slaves who escaped."" (Martha Washington\'s maid, Oney Judge, ran away while the family was living in Philadelphia. Washington abused his presidential powers by asking the Treasury Department to kidnap Judge from her new life in New Hampshire, says Chernow, but the plot failed.) \n \n In the end, any assumption that the name is tied to George may be a faulty one. ""There is no direct evidence,"" says Tony Burroughs, an expert on black genealogy. ""As far as I\'m concerned it\'s a coincidence."" \n \n But the coincidence is a marked one. According to Jesse Washington, the name is so heavily African-American that many present-day Washingtons are ""surprised to learn"" that white Washingtons exist, having never met one. In 2000, only 5 percent (8,813) of Washingtons in the U.S. were white. (The surname study was not repeated in the 2010 Census.) By comparison, Williams was the sixteenth ""blackest"" name, at 46 percent black, even though the name is much more popular, and there were 716,704 black Williamses overall. \n \n Washington: The \'Blackest Name\' In America [AP via HuffPo]', 'George Washington\'s name is inseparable from America, and not only from the nation\'s history.

The 2000 U.S. Census counted 163,036 people with the surname Washington. Ninety percent of them were African-American, a far higher black percentage than for any other common name. \n \n The story of how Washington became the ""blackest name"" begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname. \n \n Even before Emancipation, many enslaved black people chose their own surnames to establish their identities. Afterward, some historians theorize, large numbers of blacks chose the name Washington in the process of asserting their freedom. \n \n Today there are black Washingtons, like this writer, who are often identified as African-American by people they have never met. There are white Washingtons who are sometimes misidentified and have felt discrimination. There are Washingtons of both races who view the name as a special _ if complicated _ gift. \n \n And there remains the presence of George, born 279 years ago on Feb. 22, whose complex relationship with slavery echoes in the blackness of his name today. \n \n ___ \n \n George Washington\'s great-grandfather, John, arrived in Virginia from England in 1656. John married the daughter of a wealthy man and eventually owned more than 5,000 acres, according to the new biography ""Washington: A Life,"" by Ron Chernow. \n \n Along with land, George inherited 10 human beings from his father. He gained more through his marriage to a wealthy widow, and purchased still more enslaved blacks to work the lands he aggressively amassed. But over the decades, as he recognized slavery\'s contradiction with the freedoms of the new nation, Washington grew opposed to human bondage. \n \n Yet ""slaves were the basis of his fortune,"" and he would not part with them, Chernow said in an interview. \n \n Washington was not a harsh slaveowner by the standards of the time. He provided good food and medical care. He recognized marriages and refused to sell off individual family members. Later in life he resolved not to purchase any more black people. \n \n But he also worked his slaves quite hard, and under difficult conditions. As president, he shuttled them between his Philadelphia residence and Virginia estate to evade a law that freed any slave residing in Pennsylvania for six months. \n \n While in Philadelphia, Oney Judge, Martha Washington\'s maid, moved about the city and met many free blacks. Upon learning Martha was planning one day to give her to an ill-tempered granddaughter, Judge disappeared. \n \n According to Chernow\'s book, Washington abused his presidential powers and asked the Treasury Department to kidnap Judge from her new life in New Hampshire. The plot was unsuccessful. \n \n ""Washington was leading this schizoid life,"" Chernow said in the interview. ""In theory and on paper he was opposed to slavery, but he was still zealously tracking and seeking to recover his slaves who escaped."" \n \n In his final years on his Mount Vernon plantation, Washington said that ""nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union."" \n \n This led to extraordinary instructions in his will that all 124 of his slaves should be freed after the death of his wife. The only exception was the slave who was at his side for the entire Revolutionary War, who was freed immediately. Washington also ordered that the younger black people be educated or taught a trade, and he provided a fund to care for the sick or aged. \n \n ""This is a man who travels an immense distance,"" Chernow said. \n \n In contrast with other Founding Fathers, Chernow said, Washington\'s will indicates ""that he did have a vision of a future biracial society."" \n \n Twelve American presidents were slaveowners. Of the eight presidents who owned slaves while in office, Washington is the only one who set all of them free. \n \n ___ \n \n It\'s a myth that most enslaved blacks bore the last name of their owner. Only a handful of George Washington\'s hundreds of slaves did, for example, and he recorded most as having just a first name, says Mary Thompson, the historian at Mount Vernon. \n \n Still, historian Henry Wiencek says many enslaved blacks had surnames that went unrecorded or were kept secret. Some chose names as a mark of community identity, he says, and that community could be the plantation of a current or recent owner. \n \n ""Keep in mind that after the Civil War, many of the big planters continued to be extremely powerful figures in their regions, so there was an advantage for a freed person to keep a link to a leading white family,"" says Wiencek, author of ""An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America."" \n \n Sometimes blacks used the surname of the owner of their oldest known ancestor as a way to maintain their identity. Melvin Patrick Ely, a College of William and Mary professor who studies the history of blacks in the South, says some West African cultures placed high value on ancestral villages, and the American equivalent was the plantation where one\'s ancestors had toiled. \n \n Last names also could have been plucked out of thin air. Booker T. Washington, one of the most famous blacks of the post-slavery period, apparently had two of those. \n \n He was a boy when Emancipation freed him from a Virginia plantation. After enrolling in school, he noticed other children had last names, while the only thing he had ever been called was Booker. \n \n ""So, when the teacher asked me what my full name was, I calmly told him, \'Booker Washington,\'"" he wrote in his autobiography, ""Up from Slavery."" Later in life, he found out that his mother had named him ""Booker Taliaferro"" at birth, so he added a middle name. \n \n He gives no indication why the name Washington popped into his head. But George Washington, dead for only 60-odd years, had immense fame and respect at the time. His will had been widely published in pamphlet form, and it was well known that he had freed his slaves, Thompson says. \n \n Did enslaved people feel inspired by Washington and take his name in tribute, or were they seeking some benefits from the association? Did newly freed people take the name as a mark of devotion to their country? \n \n ""We just don\'t know,"" Weincek says. \n \n But the connection is too strong for some to ignore. \n \n ""There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for. They had a very strong sense of politics and history,"" says Adam Goodheart, a professor at Washington College and author of the forthcoming ""1861: Civil War Awakening."" \n \n ""They were thinking about how they could be Americans,"" Goodheart says. ""That they would embrace the name of this person who was an imperfect hero shows there was a certain understanding of this country as an imperfect place, an imperfect experiment, and a willingness to embrace that tradition of liberty with all its contradictions."" \n \n Many black people took new names after the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the black power movement, says Ira Berlin, a University of Maryland history professor who has written books on the history of African-Americans. \n \n ""Names are this central way we think about ourselves,"" Berlin says. ""Whenever we have these kinds of emancipatory moments, suddenly people can reinvent themselves, rethink themselves new, distinguish themselves from a past where they were denigrated and abused. New names are one of the ways they do it."" \n \n But for black people who chose the name Washington, it\'s rarely certain precisely why. \n \n ""It\'s an assumption that the surname is tied to George,"" says Tony Burroughs, an expert on black genealogy, who says 82 to 94 percent of all Washingtons listed in the 1880 to 1930 censuses were black. \n \n ""There is no direct evidence,"" he says. ""As far as I\'m concerned it\'s a coincidence."" \n \n ___ \n \n Coincidence or not, today the numbers are equally stark. Washington was listed 138th when the Census Bureau published a list of the 1,000 most common American surnames from the 2000 survey, along with ethnic data. The project was not repeated in 2010. \n \n Ninety percent of those Washingtons, numbering 146,520, were black. Only five percent, or 8,813, were white. Three percent were two or more races, 1 percent were Hispanic, and 1 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. \n \n Jefferson was the second-blackest name, at 75 percent African-American. There were only 16,070 Lincolns, and that number was only 14 percent black. \n \n Jackson was 53 percent black. Williams was the 16th-blackest name, at 46 percent. But there were 1,534,042 total Williamses, including 716,704 black ones _ so there were more blacks named Williams than anything else. \n \n (The name Black was 68 percent white, meaning there were far more white Blacks than black Blacks. The name White, meanwhile, was 19 percent black.) \n \n Many present-day Washingtons are surprised to learn their name is not 100 percent black. \n \n ""Growing up, I just knew that only black people had my last name,"" says Shannon Washington of New York City. Like many others, she has never met a white Washington. \n \n She has no negative feelings about her name: ""It\'s a reflection of how far we\'ve come more than anything. I most likely come from a family of slaves who were given or chose this name."" \n \n As the creator of advertisements, events and http://www.parlourmagazine.com, she works with many Europeans, who often ask how she got her name. She plans on keeping it when she gets married, and likens her attachment to that of some black people for racist memorabilia like mammy dolls and Jim Crow signs. \n \n ""I don\'t exactly love it,"" she says of her name, ""But I have to respect it."" \n \n Marcus Washington never thought much about his name as one of the few black people working in the overwhelmingly white William Morris talent agency. That changed after he filed a $25 million lawsuit in December accusing William Morris of racial discrimination. \n \n ""I\'m sure that for some people there, my name triggered the thought that I was African-American, and automatically triggered biases that resulted in me not being given a fair shot,"" he says. \n \n One 2004 study conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business found that job applicants with names that sound white receive 50 percent more callbacks than applicants with ""black"" names. \n \n The study responded to real employment ads with more than 5,000 fictitious resumes. Half the resumes were assigned names like Emily Walsh; the other half got names like Lakisha Washington. After calculating for the difference in resume quality, the study concluded that ""a white name yields as many more callbacks as an additional eight years of experience on a resume."" \n \n But what about those 8,813 white Washingtons? What is their experience? \n \n For the family of 85-year-old Larry Washington, who traces his family tree back to England in the 1700s, the experience has changed over the years. (He says he is not related to George, who had no children.) \n \n When he moved to New Jersey in 1962 to teach at a college there, Larry Washington\'s family tried to scout housing over the phone, but nothing was ever available. ""When we showed up, there were plenty of houses,"" he recalls. After that, he taught his six children to always apply in person. \n \n Over the years, his name made him sensitive to racism: ""We just simply recognized these things, and had full sympathy with the people who were really black and getting the real treatment."" \n \n His son Paul, who in the 1970s worked for a temporary agency in Long Island, NY, says people in the offices where he was assigned always betrayed their relief when he turned out to be white. He experienced housing discrimination into the \'80s, but says that no longer happens. \n \n He is now a geology professor who has lived in ten states from Louisiana to Pennsylvania. Sometimes he wonders if his name helps him get interviews at colleges looking to recruit a rare black geologist, and if it hurts him when the college discovers that he is white. \n \n Paul\'s children have had much different experiences _ like his 25-year-old daughter, an English professor who teaches foreign students, whose new pupils are always amazed to meet someone with ""the ultimate American name."" \n \n When Paul\'s brother Larry Jr. was recently traveling through customs in Japan, the inspector looked at his passport and said, ""Oh, Mr. Washington!"" \n \n ""His politeness and the number of times he bowed clearly indicated that he thought I was the member of a very important family,"" Larry Jr. recalls. \n \n His sister Ida, a veterinarian who lives in Seattle, says she has never experienced discrimination due to her name as an adult. She is married, but uses Washington as her professional name. \n \n ""It\'s very distinctive. I use it with a certain amount of pride,"" she says. \n \n Back in high school, she became fascinated with black history. ""I think my name has made me much more aware of what African-American folks struggle with. I feel in tune with them."" \n \n Perhaps her sentiments bring the name full circle _ from blacks making a connection to the greatest white Washington to a white person choosing a name associated with blackness. \n \n ""I find it touching that freed blacks wanted to identify with the American tradition and the American dream,"" says Chernow, the biographer. ""It makes a powerful statement."" \n \n ""I have to think,"" he says, ""that George Washington would be very pleased that so many black people have adopted his name."" \n \n ___ \n \n Jesse Washington covers race and ethnicity for The Associated Press. He is reachable at jwashington(at)ap.org or http://www.twitter.com/jessewashington. \n \n ___ \n \n On the Web: \n \n Census surname study: http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/index.html']",2,"– George Washington’s name is synonymous with America—and of the people who bear his surname today, 90% of them are African-American, according to the 2000 census. How did “Washington” become, as Jesse Washington, writing for the AP calls it, the “blackest name"" in America? It could be that blacks chose the name to honor George himself, an odd prospect when you consider that the first US president, while opposed to slavery on paper, owned 124 slaves and worked them hard. But perhaps not so odd when you realize that Washington also freed all 124 of those slaves upon his and his wife’s deaths; of the eight American presidents who owned slaves while in office, he was the only one to do so. Some of his former slaves may have chosen to take his surname as a mark of their community; others may have wanted to maintain a link to a powerful family after being freed. Or the choice could have been random: Booker T. Washington, for example, has never said why he chose his last name 60 years or so after George Washington’s death. Some may even have picked the name to signal their devotion to their new country: ""There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for,” says one professor and author. But one black genealogy expert, who says 82% to 94% of Washingtons listed in the 1880 to 1930 censuses were black, disagrees. ""As far as I'm concerned it's a coincidence.""

47,"['Water from the Mt. Tabor Reservoir system tested clean of urine-related toxins Thursday, news that came as no surprise to Water Bureau administrators yet also did not change their decision to dump 38 million gallons after a man peed in the Southeast Portland storage pool a day earlier. \n \n City leaders said they were going ahead with plans to drain the water in Reservoir 5 to ensure no health risks to Portland water customers. The decision to empty and clean the reservoir has drawn mention of Portland -- much of it disbelieving or out-and-out derisive -- by national and international news media. \n \n The chief point of contention: Reservoir 5 can hold up to 50 million gallons of water. The typical adult human bladder can hold two or so cups of urine. So the possibility someone getting sick because of Wednesday morning’s incident is, as Water Bureau officials acknowledge, slight at best. \n \n “From a public health protection standpoint, it’s not necessary to get rid of the water,” said Anna Harding, co-director of the School of Biological and Population Health Sciences at Oregon State University. “The urine, which has very few microorganisms to begin with, would be very, very, very, very diluted.” \n \n Still, city officials say, any risk is too much. \n \n “The professionals told me this is the way to go. I’m following their advice. We’ve got plenty of water, so we will go ahead and take the safest course,” said City Commissioner Nick Fish, who oversees the utility. “People can feel free to second guess, but this is not a debate. This is the best public health decision.” \n \n The second-guessing came from far and wide Thursday, including the leading advocate of a May ballot measure to switch control of the city’s water away from the City Council to an independently elected water district board. \n \n Kent Craford, a former lobbyist for large industrial water customers and co-petitioner of the ballot measure, said he thinks flushing 38 million gallons is a bad idea. \n \n “It’s a public relations decision,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t waste all that water, all that money.” \n \n Craford would not speculate whether the water board he’s proposing would feel the same. \n \n “That would be up to the board, up to the managers,” he said. “Our belief is that a water district board will make better decisions than the City Council, and that they would ensure better management than what we have right now.” \n \n The debate about dumping or keeping the water is uniquely Portland with roots in the city’s multi-year battle against new federal mandates on open-air reservoirs. Portland leaders opted to stop fighting last year, and Mt. Tabor’s open reservoir system must be disconnected from the city water system by the end of 2015. The open-air reservoir at Washington Park must go offline by the end of 2016. \n \n “Politics had no impact on our decision in this case,” Fish said. “But this is Mt. Tabor and the reservoirs, and everything that happens up there is evaluated through a political prism. I know people are going to second guess. That’s their right.” \n \n -- Anna Griffin', 'Update: Kavanaugh and Vocativ are now reporting that the paperwork on this case lists an incorrect last name for the man accused of urinating in the reservoir. His name is Dallas Swonger. \n \n \n \n Dallas Delynn says he didn’t urinate in Portland’s drinking supply, but rather on a wall next to it. \n \n The 18-year-old caught on video hanging around the Mt. Tabor Reservoir system early Wednesday morning has granted his first interview to the online news magazine Vocativ. \n \n In the free-flowing, profanity-laced conversation with former Oregonian reporter Shane Dixon Kavanaugh, Delynn said he did not urinate in the water: \n \n “Everybody thinks it’s funny and a joke and I’m going to be on the news,” he says, flicking the cigarette butt into a nearby bush. “It’s no … joke, dude. I don’t want people thinkin’ that Dallas is dumb ass because he pissed in the … water. In our drinking water. Yeah, that’s … awesome. I mean, wouldn’t you be pissed about that?” \n \n Instead, Delynn said he urinated on the wall next to Reservoir 5. \n \n Delynn and two friends were given written citations for trespassing – Delynn also was written up for urinating somewhere other than a park bathroom – and barred from Mt. Tabor for 30 days. Portland Water Bureau officials are working with the Multnomah County District Attorney to determine whether there are criminal charges to be filed. \n \n \n \n Delynn also told Kavanaugh he thinks it\'s silly to flush 38 million gallons of water: \n \n ""Like, how they can do that?” says Delynn. “How can they be like, ‘Yeah, we’re gonna flush all that water.’ Dude, I’ve seen dead birds in there. During the summer time I’ve see hella dead animals in there. ... I mean, really, dude?”', 'Dallas Swonger wants the world to just know one thing. \n \n “I didn’t piss in the fucking water,” he says, pulling a drag off a Newport cigarette. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dallas Swonger \n \n The Portland teen is in the hot seat after surveillance video supposedly captured him taking a leak in a city reservoir early Wednesday morning, prompting officials to flush 38 million gallons of drinking water down the drain. \n \n For those more visually inclined, that’s enough H20 to fill about 57 Olympic-size swimming pools. Or 304 million tallboy cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. \n \n “Yeah, it’s fucking retarded dude,” Swonger says. \n \n In an exclusive, expletive-filled interview with Vocativ outside his mother’s home Thursday, the 18-year-old insisted that his piss never trickled into Portland’s drinking supply. He also lamented the looming reality that this story will make him a national (and international) laughing stock. \n \n “Everybody thinks it’s funny and a joke and I’m going to be on the news,” he says, flicking the cigarette butt into a nearby bush. “It’s no fuckin’ joke, dude. I don’t want people thinkin’ that Dallas is a dumb ass because he pissed in the fuckin’ water. In our drinking water. Yeah, that’s fucking awesome. I mean, wouldn’t you be pissed about that?” \n \n The night that launched the whiz-seen-round-the-world had started off on a more feel-good note for Swonger. He says he had moved back to town that very day from St. Helens, which is 30 miles north of Portland, where he had been living with his dad. Eager to shred with some friends, he and two buddies went to skateboard at Mount Tabor Park after hours, which is home to three of the city’s five uncovered drinking water reservoirs – and a handful of excellent hill runs. After bombing down the park’s western slope, nature began to call Swonger. It was around 1 a.m. and the three friends, along with two other people they met in the park, were near one of the reservoirs. \n \n “I was like, ‘Dudes I have to piss so bad,’” he says. “So I just went over to the wall [of the reservoir].” \n \n “I leaned up against the wall and pissed on it,” he says. “Right there on the wall, dude. I don’t know else how to describe it.” \n \n Water Bureau officials, however, insist Swonger took a leek in the drink. “When you see the video, he’s leaning right up because he has to get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars,” bureau administrator Davd Shaff told the Oregonian. “There’s really no doubt what he’s doing.” \n \n Water Bureau security and Portland Police officers later stopped Swonger and his two friends, identified as Trey McDaniel and Daniel McDonald, and cited all three with trespassing. Swonger was also cited for public urination. \n \n While human pee is not a health hazard – and scores of animals piss, shit and die in Mount Tabor’s reservoirs every year – the city says it will dump a total of 38 million gallons of water, even though test results on Thursday showed no signs of water contamination. \n \n “Like, how they can do that?” says Swonger. “How can they be like, ‘Yeah, we’re gonna flush all that water.’ Dude, I’ve seen dead birds in there. During the summer time I’ve see hella dead animals in there. Like dead squirrels and shit. I mean, really, dude?” \n \n Yes, really. In 2011, city officials flushed 7.8 million gallons of reservoir water from Mount Tabor after another man decided to unzip and rip. The Water Bureau also says that it intends to pursue additional charges against Swonger. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mount Tabor Reservoir: The city is flushing 38 million gallons of drinking water down the drain because it says Dallas peed in the open reservoir. REUTERS/Steve Dipaola \n \n The whole ordeal has Swonger pretty rattled. “Dallas is really bummed out about all of it,” says his skateboard buddy McDonald, who we reached by phone on Thursday. “He’s a really good guy at heart. He just doesn’t make the best decisions. Honestly, he has the potential to do really good.” \n \n As Swonger stood outside his family’s yellow, single-story house talking to a reporter, his mother suddenly opened the front door. “Dallas, don’t do anything stupid,” she says, ushering him indoors. She adds: “I’m sorry, he just graduated from high school. He’s trying to get his stuff together.” \n \n Swonger stops at the front door and turns around. “Sorry, dude,” he says. “I don’t know, dude. I don’t know what’s going on.”']",3,"– The Portland teen accused of peeing in a city reservoir on Wednesday insists he didn't do it—in a relatively NSFW defense. ""Yeah, it's f---ing retarded, dude,"" 18-year-old Dallas Swonger tells Vocativ in what the site calls an ""expletive-filled interview"" given as Swonger smoked a Newport cigarette. ""I didn't piss in the f---ing water."" He explains that he did urinate, after a night of skateboarding at Mount Tabor Park, but he did so against the wall of the reservoir, not into the reservoir. ""I was like, 'Dudes I have to piss so bad.' So I just went over to the wall. I leaned up against the wall and pissed on it. Right there on the wall, dude. I don’t know else how to describe it."" Officials beg to differ (a Water Bureau official got very specific about it, saying that surveillance video showed Swonger making sure ""to get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars""), and thus decided to dump 38 million gallons of water, but Swonger notes that even if his urine had made it into the water, he doesn't see what the big deal is. ""Dude, I’ve seen dead birds in there. During the summer time I've see hella dead animals in there. Like dead squirrels and s---. I mean, really, dude?"" Vocativ also got amusing quotes from Swonger's mom (""I’m sorry, he just graduated from high school. He’s trying to get his stuff together"") and one of the friends skateboarding with him that night (""He just doesn’t make the best decisions. Honestly, he has the potential to do really good""). Possible criminal charges are still pending, the Oregonian notes. The paper also reports that the water tested clean of urine-related toxins, but all 38 million gallons will still be dumped."

(Photo: Nicholas Kamm, AFP/Getty Images) \n \n Addressing crises both domestic and foreign, President Obama appealed for calm Thursday amid violent protests in a St. Louis suburb, and said a rescue operation for religious minorities in Iraq will not be necessary. \n \n Obama, speaking from his vacation at Martha\'s Vineyard, Mass., called the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown a tragedy, and urged police and protesters in Ferguson, Mo., to ""take a step back"" and consider how to best move forward. \n \n ""Now\'s the time for healing,"" Obama said. ""Now\'s the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson."" \n \n STORY: Governor vows a \'different tone\' on Ferguson\'s streets \n \n STORY: Michael Brown had no criminal record, police say \n \n The president called on local police to be ""open and transparent"" about their investigation of Brown\'s death. He said there is never an excuse for looting and violence toward police officers, and ""there\'s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights."" \n \n In particular, Obama criticized police for detaining two journalists during protests Wednesday, and for threatening others. Officers ""should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,"" he said. \n \n Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs on crowds who gathered to protest the death of Brown on Saturday; some protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails. \n \n Obama called the teenager\'s death ""heartbreaking and tragic,"" and said the Department of Justice is working with local officials on the investigation. The president said he made it clear to Attorney General Eric Holder that ""we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done."" \n \n The president also said he spoke with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, calling him ""a good man."" \n \n While ""emotions are raw right now"" and ""there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama asked citizens to remember that all Americans remain united by common values. \n \n ""That includes belief in equality under the law, a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest,"" Obama said. ""A reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us and the need for accountability when it comes to our government."" \n \n As for Iraq, Obama said there has been progress with the limited military mission he announced last week. \n \n Earlier in the week, the Obama administration began considering a rescue operation for members of the Yazidi religion who were trapped atop Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq, surrounded by Islamic State fighters. \n \n On Wednesday, a Pentagon assessment team reported that most of the Yazidi have escaped, and a full-scale rescue operation would not be needed. \n \n ""We broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar,"" Obama said. ""We helped vulnerable people reach safety; and we helped save many innocent lives."" \n \n He added, ""I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly."" \n \n Obama said airstrikes would continue against militants who are threatening U.S. personnel and others in northern Iraq. Humanitarian relief to displaced Iraqis will also continue. \n \n The president praised development of a new government in Iraq, saying it will be better able to eventually take control of the fight against militants. \n \n Said Obama: ""We are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction."" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/VpCRbA', 'Ty is a 6-year-old brindle and white Bull Terrier (Photo via Frank Romano) \n \n A man is searching for his dog after he went missing Friday night, apparently from a cargo area at LAX. \n \n Frank Romano said he was flying to Tampa out of LAX via Delta Airlines Friday night with his family and his 6-year-old bull terrier, Ty. Ty was in the cargo area in a carrier Romano said he had purchased from PetCo. Romano\'s family boarded the plane, but a Delta employee escorted him off the plane and told him that an hour earlier, Ty had chewed through the door of his pet kennel and escaped. Romano found this odd. \n \n ""I don\'t know how he could\'ve bit through his kennel though when it had a metal door and was made of hard plastic,"" he said. \n \n Romano says the story about what happened to his ""best friend"" gets even more bizarre from there. For one, he doesn\'t understand why the Delta employee didn\'t tell him about Ty\'s escape immediately. Also, he said he was told that the kennel Ty escaped from would appear in baggage claim, but it never did. \n \n Romano said he searched around LAX, but Ty never turned up. The next day, his family flew to Tampa as planned. Romano has called Delta several times, but the situation has only become more confusing. \n \n ""They give us the run around,"" he told LAist. ""Even gave us a number to the cargo place at Tampa airport saying he was there. We called and said they had no dogs."" \n \n If this story sounds odd, you might be disheartened to know that it\'s not uncommon. Delta apparently has a history of losing pets. The airline has allegedly lost so many dogs under their care that someone created a Change.org petition with over 2,000 signatures to demand they take responsibility. \n \n In 2011, a New York man bought a puppy in Alabama, then arranged to have the puppy sent back to New York along with him. Delta temporarily misplaced the dog, then found it in Atlanta. In 2011, a German Shepherd headed from California to Germany to join its owner—a couple in the Army—got loose in Atlanta while under Delta\'s care. That dog was later hit by a car and died. Another unsatisfied Delta customer reported that he and his girlfriend had adopted a stray dog in Mexico in 2010, spent money nursing him to health and then made plans to bring the dog back to their home in Canada with them. Delta allegedly also gave them the run-around as to where the dog was with a similar story about an escape, but couldn\'t seem to produce the dog. \n \n Delta also mixed up two children in 2010—a boy and a girl—sending one to Boston and the other to Cleveland when it was meant to be the other way around. \n \n Romano is still looking for Ty, and still doesn\'t have any concrete answers from Delta. A representative at Delta told LAist that they would look into this and get back to us tomorrow. We\'re hoping we see Ty and Romano reunited soon. \n \n Update, November 7, 12 p.m.: Delta has provided us with the following statement: \n \n Delta continues to investigate what happened, but early indications show that procedures were followed, and the dog may have compromised the kennel on its own. Delta immediately worked with LAX airport teams and the customer to locate the dog but was unsuccessful. We remain in contact with this customer, and we are fully supporting the search for their pet. Delta understands that pets are important members of the family and regrets this occurred while this pet was entrusted to our care.']",2,"– Although it was ""very sad,"" the breakup of Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson at least seemed to be civil. Apparently that tenuous detente has ended, at least per the buzz around the 25-year-old singer's recent tweets.

49,"[""Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio told a group of Minnesota supporters Wednesday he is hoping one of the remaining candidates for president will stop Donald Trump from winning the Republican nomination — and that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could be the best option for conservatives. \n \n Rubio, who dropped out of the race Tuesday after losing his home state of Florida, didn’t endorse any of his former rivals in a conference call with dozens of Minnesota supporters. In the call, he explained his decision to leave the race and why he felt his presidential campaign didn’t do better, and suggested he might run for office again at some point in the future. \n \n He said he saw no real path forward for his campaign after losing Florida and its 99 winner-take-all delegates. He acknowledged he could have stayed in the race with the intention of seeking the nomination at the convention, but said he would have had to run a shoestring campaign with no money to defend himself on the airwaves. Even if he had won the nomination against the odds, Rubio said, the victory could prove pyrrhic. \n \n “Winning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it, even though you did it through the rules of the RNC, would be pretty much fatal for the party,” Rubio said, though he added that many Republicans will not vote for Trump, either. \n \n But he’s rooting for someone else to stop Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination — someone who can go into the convention with more delegates and a better claim than Rubio believes he would have been able to muster. \n \n He didn’t endorse either Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the two other remaining candidates. But Rubio praised Cruz as “the only conservative left in the race.” \n \n Rubio said his positive campaign message didn’t match the national mood, and said media coverage helped snowball Super Tuesday losses into the end of his campaign. \n \n “This election was entirely driven by national media coverage, in many ways,” Rubio said, in audio of the conference call obtained by the Pioneer Press. “When the media narrative goes negative on you, and all the news is bad, it kind of knocks us off.” \n \n Minnesota was one of only three primaries or caucuses Rubio won in his year-long presidential campaign and the only state he won. His other wins were in Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. \n \n “We’re always joking the last 24 hours at home that we need to move to Minnesota with a winter home in Puerto Rico and work in D.C.,” Rubio said. \n \n The Florida senator said he had tried to run an upbeat campaign, but didn’t think that message resonated in an election when “there’s a lot of frustration in this country.” \n \n “I really believe we’re on the verge of an incredible era in our history,” Rubio said, but added: “This is not the greatest year for that kind of message.” \n \n Describing the arc of his campaign for his Minnesota supporters, Rubio said he endured an “unprecedented” amount of attack ads from the Super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Though he “weathered” those ads, Rubio said he “probably could have won Iowa if it weren’t for the TV attacks.” \n \n He said he “saw the bottom fall out of our support” after the March 1 elections, when Rubio won Minnesota but lost everywhere else. \n \n “The media kind of just said, ‘Marco Rubio had a terrible night, and it looks like the strongest anti-Trump alternative is Ted Cruz,'” Rubio said. \n \n He rejected an unidentified supporter’s suggestion that negative coverage by Fox News was particularly to blame for his defeat, but said “there were a couple people on (Fox) that went full Trump.” \n \n The “drumbeat” of negative news about his chances made it harder for Rubio to raise money, he said, and also turned away potential voters. \n \n “When the media is constantly telling you, ‘So-and-so is winning and so-and-so is losing,’ it impacts voters,” he said. \n \n Rubio said polling showed him trailing in Florida by just 5 points last Thursday — “We were closing fast on Donald Trump in Florida,” he said. But by the time Tuesday came around Rubio got blown out by 17 points. \n \n “The only thing that happened over the weekend was the constant drip drip drip of ‘Rubio’s losing’ ” in the media, he said — as well as a Trump rally in Chicago that was canceled after a heavy presence from protesters. “I don’t know for a fact it had an impact on voters, but there’s nothing else that happened during that three-day period.” \n \n But Rubio acknowledged that media narratives cut both ways. \n \n “When we won Iowa, we came in third place, but the media coverage treated us like the winner. We were raising $250,000 a day online,” Rubio said. “We benefited from that narrative, but in the end, we were hurt by it, too. That’s just the way it is.” \n \n He said he is “at peace” with his decision to leave the race but believes he might seek office in the future — though he joked he doesn’t “have any ‘Rubio 2020’ signs printed out or anything like that.” \n \n “I remain open to public service in the future if the opportunity is right for me,” Rubio said. \n \n Rachel E.

FRIDAY: Popular student’s deadly attack stuns school and community \n \n EARLIER POST \n \n Two students are dead after one of them opened fire Friday morning in the Marysville-Pilchuck High School cafeteria before turning the gun on himself, authorities said. \n \n Police said a girl was killed and two other girls and two boys were wounded in the 10:45 a.m. shooting. Several students identified the shooter as freshman Jaylen Fryberg, recently named the school’s homecoming prince. \n \n Zach Yarbrough, a junior, said he saw the shooter “extend his arm across a round table and fire his gun three to four times.” He watched the shootings but didn’t see what happened afterward because he “was already out of the cafeteria.” \n \n Four young people — two boys and two girls — were taken by ambulance to Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. \n \n Both girls who are at Providence with gunshot wounds to the head are now out of surgery and in a critical care unit. Both were ID’d by family members with the help of police, but families asked not to release their names. Doctors will monitor brain activity overnight, and there was no immediate prognosis, said Dr. Joanne Roberts, chief medical officer for Providence. \n \n Friday afternoon, teary-eyed teens and adults who said they were family and friends of one of the victims huddled in a hallway near a main entrance to the hospital. Some made calls on their cellphones, but most stood quietly near one another. \n \n Another victim, Andrew Fryberg, a 15-year-old cousin of Jaylen, had surgery at Providence then was transferred to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. \n \n The fourth, 14-year-old Nate Hatch, was shot in the jaw and was also transferred to Harborview. He was out of surgery and in serious condition Friday afternoon. He also is a cousin of Fryberg. \n \n “His family is coming to grips with what happened,” a hospital spokeswoman said. \n \n Jarron Webb, 15, said the shooter was angry about a romantic relationship he was involved in, and that the girl was one of the people shot. He said he believes one of the victims was his friend since kindergarten. \n \n Freshmen Brandon Carr, 15, and Kobe Baumann, 14, said they were just outside the cafeteria when the shooting happened. \n \n “We started hearing these loud banging noises, like someone hitting a trash can,” Carr said. They heard screaming and yelling. \n \n “Once I knew it was gunshots, we just booked it,” Carr said. \n \n They eventually joined about two dozen kids inside a classroom with police and FBI. Police told them to stay in there. “Everybody in the classroom was just freaking out crying,” Carr said. Eventually, they were told they could leave, and were loaded onto buses. \n \n Carr said he knew Fryberg and that both were on the freshman football team. He said that Thursday at practice, Fryberg was in good spirits. \n \n “He was all happy, dancing around and listening to music. I don’t know what happened today,” Carr said. \n \n Baumann said he was in fourth-period English class with Fryberg right before the shooting, and that he seemed kind of nervous. \n \n “He sits right up in the front. He got called on, but he just kept his head down and didn’t really say anything.” \n \n Students reported pandemonium in the lunchroom after the shooting, with dozens rushing for doors and then jumping a fence to escape. \n \n Freshman Austin Wright said every exit in the lunchroom was jammed with kids escaping gunfire. “I heard three gunshots and I ran.” \n \n Richard Young, who knows the Fryberg family and has a son at the high school, said he’s heard community members describe Jaylen as “a really good kid.” \n \n “He was well-liked,” Young said. “It’s just a big shock to everybody.” \n \n Fryberg’s postings on Twitter are full of angst, with his most recent posting on Thursday morning saying, “It won’t last…. It’ll never last….” \n \n “I should have listened…. You were right,” he wrote in another message earlier in the week. \n \n Other images on social media showed him joyful, playing sports and spending time with his girlfriend. One image shows him proudly holding the antler of a deer, with a hunting rifle next to him. \n \n Jaylen comes from a family that is prominent in the Tulalip Tribes. His grandfather is director of fish and wildlife at the tribe. \n \n “Anytime something happens to one of our kids, it affects everyone,” tribal communications director Niki Cleary said. “Everybody will be dealing with this for a long time.” \n \n As residents gathered at the Don Hatch Youth Center on the reservation, one Tulalip resident said many members heard the last name on the news and immediately knew who the broadcasters were talking about. By process of elimination, they realized it was Jaylen. \n \n “We’re all one family,” he said. “You never imagine it’s going to happen here.” \n \n A crisis team is providing counseling services at the center. Anyone in the area is welcome to come, behavioral health executive director Diane Henry said. \n \n “We’ll be here as long as we’re needed,” Henry said. \n \n At a noon news conference, Marysville Police Cmdr. Robb Lamoureux called the scene an active investigation and said police officers were going door-to-door to ensure that the campus was safe. They were leaving tape to mark the doors of rooms that had been cleared. Officers were finding students and staff members hiding alone or in small groups. \n \n “We are confident that there was only one shooter and that the shooter is dead,” Lamoureux said. \n \n Some of the school’s 1,200 students were evacuated, walking out and across the fields with their hands up. Others were told to stay inside classrooms. \n \n Sophomore Arlene Cortez, 16, says she locked herself in a classroom with other students for about 45 minutes before police came in. \n \n Some were bused to the nearby Shoultes Gospel Hall, where they are being accounted for. Lamoureux urged parents and family members of students to stay away from the scene, saying authorities would provide information on a location for them to be reunited with students. \n \n At the church, tearful parents and students were being reunited, and hugging. \n \n “I never thought I would be standing here after a school shooting,” said Heather Parker, whose son, Corbin, is a senior. “He’s pretty shook up. He just said ‘I’m OK.’ He was trying to calm me down.” \n \n Adam Holston, 14, a freshman, was just leaving the lunchroom when the gunfire broke out. “Everyone just started running. I could hear the gunshots and my heart was racing and we didn’t know what was going on.” \n \n Some ran out to the parking lot, some to the field. \n \n “Someone opened a door and we all ran into classrooms and just stayed there.” \n \n Jery Holston had two children in the school communicating with him by cellphone. They were both OK. Adam is a freshman; Kayleigh is a senior. \n \n Holston said Adam called him this morning yelling, “Dad, dad, hurry, someone is shooting. Please come.” He said his son ran and hid outside in the field by the stadium. \n \n Jery was in Stanwood at the time. “I probably did a hundred miles per hour to get there. I didn’t stop for anything. My heart went into my stomach. As a father, this has been my fear since my kids have been in school, that something like this would happen.” \n \n Ayn Dietrich-Williams, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Seattle, said agents were in Marysville to offer assistance. \n \n All classes have been canceled through next week, and activities and sports through at least the weekend. \n \n Marysville is among three school districts recently chosen to share a $10 million federal grant for improved student mental-health services, which have been identified as a pressing need. Administrators were working on plans for the money just as news came about the shooting Friday morning. \n \n “We’re stunned,” just stunned,” said Jodi Runyon, assistant to Marysville superintendent Becky Berg. \n \n Jerry Jenkins, who supervises Marysville and several other districts for the Puget Sound Educational Service District, said, “The tragedy that happened in Marysville could have happened anywhere. We used to have a much greater social safety net. Marysville has been willing to sit down and work with mental health providers to get mental health services to kids who need it, even though that is not a school’s traditional role.” \n \n This story includes information from Times staff reporters Jennifer Sullivan, Christine Clarridge, Mike Baker, Leah Todd, Lewis Kamb, Coral Garnick, Paige Cornwell, Dan Beekman and Jim Brunner, Times researcher Miyoko Wolf and assistant metro editor John de Leon. \n \n Photos: Scenes from the Marysville-Pilchuck High School shooting']",2,"– Politicians are getting behind Ted Cruz ... sort of: In a conference call to Minnesota supporters Wednesday that was mostly focused on explaining why he dropped out of the presidential race, Marco Rubio said that he hopes one of the GOP candidates still in the race will keep Donald Trump from becoming the nominee, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.

50,"['Abstract \n \n We document a new genus and species of shrew rat from the north peninsula of Sulawesi Island, Indonesia. The new taxon is known only from the type locality at 1,600 m elevation on Mt. Dako, in the district of Tolitoli. It is distinguished from all other Indonesian murines by its large, flat, pink nose with forward-facing nares. Relative to other Sulawesi murines, the species has extremely large ears (~ 21% of head and body length), very long urogenital hairs, prominent and medially bowing hamular processes on the pterygoid bones, extremely long and procumbent lower incisors, and unusually long articular surfaces on the mandibular condyles. Morphologically, the new taxon is most similar to a group of endemic Sulawesi rats known commonly as “shrew rats.” These are long faced, carnivorous murines, and include the genera Echiothrix, Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, Sommeromys, and Tateomys. Our Bayesian and likelihood analyses of DNA sequences concatenated from 5 unlinked loci infer the new shrew rat as sister to a clade consisting of Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, and Echiothrix, suggesting that Sulawesi shrew rats represent a clade. The Sulawesi water rat, Waiomys mamasae, was sister to the shrew rats in our analyses. Discovery of this new genus and species brings known shrew rat diversity on Sulawesi to 6 genera and 8 species. The extent of morphological diversity among these animals is remarkable considering the small number of species currently known. \n \n Kami mendokumentasikan genus dan spesies baru tikus cucurut dari bagian semenanjung utara pulau Sulawesi, Indonesia. Takson baru ini hanya diketahui dari lokasi spesimen tipe pada ketinggian 1,600 mdpl di Gunung Dako, Kabupaten Tolitoli. Ia dibedakan dari spesies tikus Indonesia lainnya berdasarkan ukuran hidung yang besar, datar, berwarna merah muda dengan moncong hidung menghadap ke arah depan. Jika dibandingkan dengan spesies tikus Sulawesi lainnya, spesies ini memiliki telinga yang sangat besar (~ 21% dari panjang kepala dan badan), rambut urogenital yang sangat panjang, prosesus hamular yang jelas dan menonjol pada pertulangan pterygoid, gigi seri bagian bawah yang sangat panjang, dan penampang persendian yang panjang dan tidak biasa pada kondilus mandibula. Secara morfologi, takson ini lebih mirip dengan kelompok tikus endemik Sulawesi yang umumnya dikenal sebagai “tikus cucurut”. Kelompok ini dicirikan dengan mulut yang panjang, pemakan daging, dan termasuk didalamnya adalah genus Echiothrix, Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, Sommeromys, dan Tateomys. Analisis Bayesian dan likelihood menggunakan sambungan sekuens DNA dari 5 lokus yang tidak terpaut menunjukkan spesies tikus cucurut baru ini berkerabat dekat dengan kelompok yang terdiri dari Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, dan Echiothrix, memberi kesan tikus cucurut Sulawesi merepresentasikan suatu clade atau kelompok tersendiri. Tikus air Sulawesi, Waiomys mamasae, diketahui berkerabat dekat dengan tikus cucurut dalam analisis yang dilakukan. Penemuan genus dan spesies baru ini menambah keanekaragaman jenis tikus cucurut di Sulawesi yang telah diketahui menjadi 6 genera dan 8 spesies. Besarnya perbedaan morfologi di antara spesies-spesies tersebut merupakan sesuatu yang luar biasa mengingat sedikitnya jumlah spesies yang telah diketahui saat ini.', 'Hog-nosed Shrew Rat (courtesy: Kevin C. Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals, Museum Victoria) Hog-nosed Shrew Rat (courtesy: Kevin C. Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals, Museum Victoria) Jake Esselstyn, Curator of Mammals for the LSU Museum of Natural Science (courtesy: Kevin C. Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals, Museum Victoria) \n \n LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn and his international collaborators have discovered a new genus and species on a remote, mountainous island in Indonesia. This new discovery is the third new genus described by this group of scientists since 2012, and identifies a rodent with features never seen by the scientific community before. \n \n On the second morning of their field season in 2013, Esselstyn and Museum Victoria Senior Curator of Mammals Kevin Rowe set out in opposite directions from their field camp to check their traps. Unbeknownst to each other, they both caught the same type of animal in their respective traps and immediately knew they were looking at a new species. \n \n “We had never seen anything like this. It was obviously a new species. We came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well,” Esselstyn said. \n \n The animal is a shrew rat with a large, flat, pink nose and forward-facing nostrils for which they named the Hog-nosed rat, or Hyorhinomys stuempkei. With extremely large ears, long hind legs that may be used for hopping, long white incisors and very long urogenital hairs, the Hog-nosed rat is so genetically different from any other species that the scientists described it as a new genus. This discovery is the cover story of the Journal of Mammalogy this month. \n \n Long incisors are a trait of shrew rats. But the Hog-nosed rat has especially long incisors. Another distinct characteristic of the Hog-nosed rat is that it lacks a jaw muscle attachment point found in most mammals called the coronoid process on the dentary bone. \n \n “I don’t know of any other rodents that have lost the coronoid process completely,” Esselstyn said. \n \n The loss of the coronoid process indicates a weak jaw musculature and a diet that does not require vigorous chewing. The scientists found that the new species eats earthworms and beetle larvae. \n \n Challenging Study Site \n \n The island of Sulawesi in Indonesia is geographically complex, mountainous and challenging to scientifically sample. Little research has been conducted on the island since the early 20th century. \n \n “On Sulawesi, there is a lot of ground to cover and most of it hasn’t been surveyed before, especially at high elevation,” Esselstyn said. \n \n He and his collaborators from Australia and Indonesia have been studying the region since 2010. Inundated by constant rain, the study site for this discovery was a moss-covered habitat on Mt. Dako at about 1,600 meters elevation and a two-day trek from the nearest village. \n \n “There’s a lot of biogeographic complexity at Sulawesi. So we’re not too surprised that we’re finding new things. But our team has been a bit surprised by the degree to which these animals are really novel. They are not just subtly different organisms, but really charismatically different,” Rowe said. \n \n The scientists described the Few-toothed shrew rat, or Paucidentomys vermidax, in 2012. One of the reasons why scientists have thought that rodents have been evolutionarily successful is they have incisors for gnawing and molars for grinding. \n \n “However, this rat we described in 2012, doesn’t have molars and they really can’t gnaw because of the shape of their incisors. Interestingly, this species has lost the two things that we think made rodents successful,” Esselstyn said. \n \n In 2014, the scientists described the Sulawesi water rat, Waiomys mamasae, which was known to villagers and their guides but not to the scientific community. Villagers use this animal as a talisman to protect their homes against fire. \n \n “Our guides didn’t tell us right away that they had caught it. We were asleep and they were up late at night discussing whether they should give it to us or keep it for themselves. We were very glad that they eventually decided to give it to us, because otherwise we would have left and never had known about this animal,” he said. \n \n These animals Esselstyn and his colleagues have described are new species within new genera, because the animals could not be placed within any existing group. After sequencing the DNA from the specimens, the scientists had the molecular evidence to confirm the species’ unique distinctions.', 'As rats go, this one is pretty cute. And until Tuesday, the world was oblivious to its existence. But thanks to the fieldwork of a research team from Australia, Indonesia and America the 250-gram animal has been discovered in the remote, high-altitude jungle of Sulawesi, Indonesia. \n \n Described for the first time in the Journal of Mammalogy, this new species of mammal is so unique that it also represents a new genus. \n \n Museum Victoria mammalogist Kevin Rowe, a member of the team that found the rat in 2013, said among the distinct features were its very small mouth, large white front teeth, big ears and noticeably long pubic hairs. \n \n Dr Kevin Rowe of the Museum Victoria, with a specimen of the newly discovered mammal species, the hog-nosed rat, found in Indonesia. Photo: Eddie Jim \n \n ""It was exciting as I knew immediately that we had a new species,"" Dr Rowe said. ""I am still amazed that we can walk into a forest and find a new species of mammal that is so obviously different from any species, or even genus, that has ever been documented by science."" \n \n Advertisement \n \n While scientists are yet to observe a live hog-nosed rat, the five specimens caught in overnight traps boast long hind limbs similar to a bandicoot, suggesting it might hop, and long pubic hairs not seen in rats but featured on an Australian hopping mammal, the potoroo. \n \n The mouth can hardly open suggesting the carnivorous rat \'slurps\' up its food - most likely earthworms, beetle larvae and other invertebrates. \n \n Meet the newest mammal discovered: the hog-nosed rat from Indonesia. Photo: Museum Victoria \n \n ""It looks like it\'s whistling all the time,"" Dr Rowe said. \n \n While the 40-45 centimetre animal\'s unique anatomy was evidence it was a new species, genetic testing confirmed it was also a new genus. \n \n The hog-nosed rat was found in the cool but humid moss forests of Sulawesi\'s northern peninsula, 1600 metres above sea level. The nearest village is a two-hour hike away and even that village is considered remote. \n \n The pig-like nose with forward-facing nostrils inspired its Greek-in-origin genus name: Hyorhinomys (\'hyo\' meaning hog, \'rhino\' meaning nose and \'mys\' meaning rat). \n \n Named by the discovery team from Museum Victoria, Indonesia\'s Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense and the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science, the rat\'s scientific name is Hyorhinomys stuempkei. \n \n Dr Rowe said the rat\'s closest relative was a group of shrew rats found on Sulawesi but that they were not closely related. All rats and mice evolved 25 million years ago, of which there are about 1500 known species. \n \n Geologically isolated, Sulawesi has not been connected to Australia or Asia for 10 million years. The fieldwork is part of a wider project to document and establish the area\'s biodiversity, long considered a hot spot of endemic species.']",3,"– A newly found creature's name is the hog-nosed rat, and things don't get any more picturesque from there. Reporting on their find in the Journal of Mammalogy, scientists describe the animal, found in 2013 on Mount Dako, on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island: It's a long-faced carnivorous creature with ""extremely large ears (~21% of head and body length) [and] very long urogenital hairs""—the latter being pubic hairs. Co-author Kevin Rowe tells Mashable Australia that it's unclear what purpose the hair serves, though ""it probably helps it in some kind of reproductive way. Both males and females have those long ... hairs, like whiskers. They're not like human pubic hairs."" Among its other features: Rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat's mouth opening is so narrow that it can't open it much. ""It probably eats worms and insect larvae, just kind of slurping them up."" (In line with that slurping, it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone, which other mammals rely on to chew.) KNOE reports it's the third genus newly identified by the international team since 2012 (here's another of the team's finds), and recalls the moment the rat was found—twice. Rowe, of Museum Victoria, and LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn went to check their respective traps, saw what was clear to them was a new species, ""came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well."" The rodent was given the name Hyorhinomys stuempkei, which the Age translates from the Greek as ""'hyo' meaning hog, 'rhino' meaning nose and 'mys' meaning rat.""

He was sentenced to death in 2005 on charges that he shot a disabled nurse and former patient, Joyce Brannon, to keep her from testifying against him. \n \n He did not testify in his own defense during his trial.

United States, 08-1280."", 'Federal prosecutors announced Friday they will seek the death penalty for a former University of Illinois graduate student accused of kidnapping, torturing and killing a visiting scholar from China in June. \n \n In making the announcement, prosecutors alleged for the first time that Brendt Christensen “choked and sexually assaulted” another victim in 2013 in central Illinois. He also has claimed “additional victims” and expressed a “desire to be known as a killer,” according to prosecutors. \n \n Christensen, 28, who is being held without bond, had tentatively been set to go to trial Feb. 27 in federal court in Urbana on a charge of kidnapping resulting in a death stemming from the disappearance of 26-year-old Yingying Zhang, whose body has not been found. \n \n The decision to seek the death penalty — which required the approval of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions — means that the trial will likely be delayed for months. \n \n The death penalty was abolished in Illinois state court in 2011 after years of allegations of deep flaws in the state’s justice system. In certain cases, though, it remains a tool for federal prosecutors, but its use in federal courts is still rare. It also can take years for an execution to actually be carried out. \n \n The last person to be sentenced to death in a federal courtroom in Illinois was Dr. Ronald Mikos, who was convicted in 2005 in Chicago of murdering a former patient to keep her from testifying against him in a Medicare fraud trial. \n \n Mikos, 69, whose appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied nearly a decade ago, is still awaiting execution in federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., federal records show. \n \n The announcement in Christensen’s case marks at least the third time in recent weeks that Sessions has opted to push for the death penalty. Earlier this month, it was revealed prosecutors would seek the death penalty against Billy Arnold, an alleged gang member accused of killing two rivals in Michigan. In December, Sessions greenlighted pursuit of the death penalty against Jarvis Wayne Madison, a Florida man who allegedly kidnapped and killed his estranged wife. \n \n In their five-page motion Friday, prosecutors said the death penalty was warranted because Christensen “is likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would constitute a continuing and serious threat to the lives and safety of others.” \n \n No details of the alleged 2013 sexual assault by Christensen were provided other than the initials of the victim, “M.D.” The alleged assault occurred the year Christensen was admitted to the university’s highly competitive physics graduate program. \n \n Four years later, Zhang\'s sudden disappearance rattled the U. of I. campus and sent shock waves throughout China. \n \n Zhang, who began her research appointment last April, tried unsuccessfully to flag down a bus before walking to another stop the afternoon of June 9. Shortly after, federal authorities allege, Christensen approached Zhang in his black Saturn Astra sedan and lured her inside. \n \n Surveillance video from a nearby parking garage captured the exchange in which Zhang could be seen speaking to the driver for several moments before getting into the front passenger seat. \n \n The investigation focused on Christensen after police concluded his Saturn was the car seen in the video. He initially told the FBI he was home all day playing video games on the day Zhang disappeared. \n \n Yingying Zhang, 26, a visiting scholar at the University of Illinois, has been missing since June 9, 2017. Authorities say she is presumed dead. Brendt Christensen, 28, has been charged with kidnapping Zhang. \n \n When he was questioned a second time, Christensen changed his story, telling agents he got the date mixed up, according to court records. He said he was driving on campus, came across an Asian woman looking distressed and offered her a ride because she said she was late to an appointment, authorities said. Christensen said the woman panicked after he made a wrong turn, and he let her out of his car a few blocks from where they met, prosecutors said. \n \n Meanwhile, police searched Christensen’s car and determined that the area where Zhang would have been sitting had been cleaned in a way to conceal evidence, according to prosecutors. Police also searched his phone and found visits to a sadomasochism fetish website with discussion threads on kidnapping fantasies, prosecutors said. \n \n On June 29, Christensen attended a campus rally for Zhang with a girlfriend, who unbeknownst to him was wearing an FBI wire. He was captured on audio recordings describing his ""ideal victim"" as he pointed out people in the crowd, prosecutors have previously said. \n \n Other recordings made that day captured Christensen admitting to having kidnapped Zhang and describing how she fought back as he held her against her will, according to prosecutors. \n \n Earlier this week, a defense filing revealed that a few hours before Zhang’s kidnapping, a female U. of I. graduate student reported to police that a man wearing aviator sunglasses had pulled up to her in a black sedan and flashed a badge. She refused to get in the car and he drove off. \n \n A few days later, the woman picked out Christensen’s photo from among six shown her by the FBI, but Christensen’s lawyers are seeking to block the testimony, saying she couldn’t be certain because of the sunglasses. \n \n She did say that of the six photos, Christensen ""shared the most characteristics"" of the man because of his ""short, dark hair and tan face,"" the filing said. \n \n jmeisner@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @jmetr22b \n \n RELATED: Earlier abduction attempt reported on day Chinese scholar went missing at U. of I. » \n \n Parents of missing Chinese scholar: \'I don\'t know how to spend the rest of my life without my daughter\' » \n \n At vigil for missing Chinese scholar, suspect talked about \'ideal victim,\' prosecutor says »']",2,"– University of Illinois graduate student Yingying Zhang disappeared in June. The Chinese woman's body has not been found, but federal prosecutors believe that Brendt Christensen is responsible for her murder—and they announced Friday that, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions' blessing, they will pursue the death penalty in their case against him. The Chicago Tribune looks at just how rare a thing such a conviction and sentence would be. Illinois did away with the death penalty in 2011, and its use in federal court is far from commonplace. More on the case, the move, and the growing allegations against Christensen: The Tribune reports the last instance of the federal sentence being imposed in Illinois court was in 2005, when Dr. Ronald Mikos was found guilty of murdering a one-time patient who was cooperating in a Medicare fraud trial against him. The Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal in 2009, the AP reported at the time, but he still awaits execution."

Fired in late July 2017, less than two weeks after his appointment, the White House’s official reason for releasing Scaramucci was to give its new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly, a clean slate. Scaramucci’s tenure in Trump’s cabinet was tumultuous despite being short. The highlights included apparent protocol breaches with the FBI, conflicting statements about his relationship with then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and a profanity laced interview with The New Yorker, in which he spoke ill of several other Trump administration officials, including Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.

It’s not hard to see why. The lame duck two-term governor fawned over Donald Trump after the bombastic billionaire won the presidential election. Many speculated Christie was angling for a post in the new administration. Trump did name Christie to head his transition team, but eventually replaced him with Mike Pence. In the end, Trump decided not to include Christie in his cabinet, possibly because Christie was damaged goods. Indeed, Christie’s reputation was sullied by the Bridgegate scandal in which allies created a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge in early September 2013, hoping motorists would blame a local Democratic mayor for the tie-up. \n \n The outgoing governor said he does not care about poll numbers. That seemed to be the case last month when Christie and his family were spotted lounging on a state-owned beach while the general public was denied beach access due to a statewide government shutdown. \n \n Source: Federal Bureau of Investigation \n \n 3. James Comey \n \n > Occupation: Director of the FBI \n \n James Comey has been a controversial figure since the middle of the 2016 presidential election. Initially, Comey was criticized for publicly attacking Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s judgment in using a private email server during her time at the State Department. Comey garnered even more ire when, in an apparent break with bureau protocol, he announced candidate Clinton was the subject of an FBI investigation only days before the election. While some attribute President Donald Trump’s electoral victory to Comey’s investigation of Clinton, Trump abruptly fired the FBI Director less than five months into his presidency. \n \n Comey had served as FBI Director since 2013, when he was appointment by President Barack Obama, until he was terminated by Trump in May 2017. The White House has since provided multiple conflicting justifications for Comey’s firing. \n \n Source: media.ford.com \n \n 4.

A loyal company man, Fields had been with Ford since 1989, working his way up to COO in 2012 and CEO in 2014. \n \n Fields’ time at the top was limited largely due to his failure to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure as CEO — even as corporate revenue climbed over 5% from 2014 to 2016. Shareholder confidence was mostly undermined by Fields’ determination to take on Tesla, investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology. Despite attempts to woo shareholders by announcing a 10% reduction in its global workforce in early May 2017 in order to boost profits, Fields was let go later that month. \n \n Source: Flickr / Keith Allison \n \n 5.

53,"['""The Road"" is a road you\'ll wish hadn\'t been taken. Not because anything\'s been badly done, but because there\'s a serious imbalance in the complicated equation between what the film forces us to endure and what we end up receiving in return.Given that it\'s based on Cormac McCarthy\'s somber novel, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for a devastating report from the end of the world witnessed by a man who\'s been there, it\'s no surprise that the film is for the most part profoundly depressing.What is disappointing is that despite numerous strong areas, including fine acting by Viggo Mortensen and young Kodi Smit-McPhee as father-and-son survivors of an unnamed apocalypse, what we\'ve been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile, an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book.As adapted by British playwright Joe Penhall and directed by John Hillcoat, best known for the slickly violent ""The Proposition,"" ""The Road"" turns out to be good at shocking and upsetting us, but it lacks the compensating emotional heft that would make absorbing those shocks worth our while.For while Chris Kennedy\'s formidable production design places us in an uncomfortably real space, absent McCarthy\'s haunting language, ""The Road"" for the most part is not so good at transcendence, at making us feel, as the book definitely does, that there is reason for us to endure its pitiless descriptions of what Joseph Conrad described in ""Heart of Darkness"" as ""the horror, the horror.""What Conrad was likely talking about, and what ""The Road"" devotes considerable time to on the screen and on the page, is the terrors that humans inflict on each other. One of the provocative questions this story asks is whether staying alive is worth the savagely inhuman actions necessary to make survival possible.Unwilling to begin on a totally downbeat note, ""The Road"" opens with what turns out to be a dream flashback to a time just before the unspecified catastrophe happens, a time when Mortensen\'s unnamed man is married to Charlize Theron\'s unnamed woman and their first child is on the way.Ten years into the post-apocalypse, the mother is gone, the unborn child is a young boy (Australian actor Smit-McPhee) and the world has changed. It\'s a blasted, blighted, ashen and slowly dying Earth, shaken by quakes, lighted by out-of-control fires and filled with dead cars, empty buildings, deserted bridges and very few people.To stay alive in this world, you have to keep moving, wearing the most utilitarian rags you can find (Margot Wilson did the excellent costume design) and pushing the shopping cart that contains all your possessions. It\'s a vision of a world largely without us that completely chills the soul.The casting of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee is one of the film\'s strengths. With straggly hair and a great wild look, Mortensen is convincing as a harried survivor, and the rapport he has with the more innocent and soulful child played by Smit-McPhee is excellent.""I\'ve never had a better acting partner,"" Mortensen has said, ""someone I knew had my back, and he knew I had his.""One of the great fears of those few survivors is cannibalism, something the strong inflict on the weak, and scenes that hint at that are among ""The Road\'s"" hardest to take.The man\'s greatest fear is that he will die before his son is old enough to protect himself, and the son\'s greatest fear, paradoxically, is that he and his father will somehow lose the essence of their humanity in the drive to stay alive. ""Are we still the good guys?"" he asks his father plaintively. ""Are we carrying the fire?""This pair have their affecting moments, as does Robert Duvall as a kind of barely alive human lump, but absent McCarthy\'s transformative prose, which has a power even images can\'t improve on, what we are left with is more endurance test than anything more elevated.If it is to do more than horrify and depress us, ""The Road"" is in need of a finer sensibility, and that is simply not on offer.', 'The Road \n \n November 24, 2009 \n \n Cast & Credits The Man Viggo Mortensen \n \n The Boy Kodi Smit-McPhee \n \n Wife Charlize Theron \n \n Old Man Robert Duvall \n \n The Veteran Guy Pearce \n \n \n \n Dimension Films presents a film directed by John Hillcoat. Written by Joe Penhall, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy. Running time: 119 minutes. Rated R. \n \n \n \n Printer-friendly » \n \n E-mail this to a friend » \n \n Note: I first saw ""The Road"" in September at the Toronto Film Festival, as one of eight films I saw in three days. I wrote a draft of a review at the time and sent it. That review accidentally found its way into sight in October, long before the film was scheduled to open. I yanked it offline as quickly as I could. \n \n \n \n I saw the movie a second time at a press screening on Oct. 27 in Chicago. I see festival films again whenever I have the chance. I find the second viewing makes the good ones better, and the bad ones worse. Such is the case with ""The Road."" \n \n ""The Road"" evokes the images and the characters of Cormac McCarthy\'s novel. It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling. I\'m not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers. The novel itself would not be successful if it were limited to its characters and images. Its effect comes above all through McCarthy\'s prose. It is the same with all of McCarthy\'s work, but especially this one, because his dialogue is so restrained, less baroque than usual. \n \n \n \n The story is straightforward: America has been devastated. Habitations have been destroyed or abandoned, vegetation is dying, crops have failed, the infrastructure of civilization has disappeared. This has happened in such recent memory that even The Boy, so young, was born into a healthy world. No reason is given for this destruction, perhaps because no reason would be adequate. McCarthy evokes the general apprehension of post-9/11. The Boy and The Man make their way toward the sea, perhaps for no better reason than that sea has always been the direction of hope in this country. \n \n \n \n The surviving population has been reduced to savage survivalists, making slaves of the weaker, possibly using them as food. We\'ve always done that, employing beef cattle, for example, to do the grazing on acres of pasture so we can consume the concentrated calories of their labor. In a land where food is scarce, wanderers seek out canned goods and fear their own bodies will perform this work for the cannibals. \n \n \n \n Although we read of those who stockpile guns and ammunition for an apocalypse, weapon stores on the Road have dwindled down. The Man has a gun with two remaining bullets. He is a wary traveler, suspecting everyone he sees. He and The Boy are transporting a few possessions in a grocery cart. He encourages his son to keep walking, but holds out little hope for the end of their journey. \n \n \n \n I am not sure the characters could be played better, or differently. Viggo Mortensen portrays The Man as dogged and stubborn, determined to protect his boy. Kodi Smit-McPhee is convincing as a child stunned by destruction, depending on his father in a world where it must be clear to him that any man can die in an instant. The movie resists any tendency toward making the child cute, or the two of them heartwarming. \n \n \n \n Flashback scenes star Charlize Theron as the wife and mother of the two in earlier, sunnier days. These sequences show the marriage as failing, and these memories haunt The Man. I\'m not sure what relevance this subplot has to the film as a whole; a marriage happy or sad -- isn\'t it much the same in this new world? It has a lot of relevance, however, to The Man and The Boy. In times of utter devastation, memories are what we cling to. \n \n \n \n The external events of the novel have been boldly solved, and this is an awesome production. But McCarthy\'s prose has the uncanny ability to convey more than dialogue and incident. It\'s as dense as poetry. It is more spare in The Road than in a more ornate work like Suttree; in The Road, it is as evocative in the way Samuel Beckett is. If it were not, ""The Road"" might be just another film of sci-fi apocalypse. It\'s all too easy to imagine how this material could be vulgarized, as Richard Matheson\'s novel was in the 2007 version of ""I Am Legend."" \n \n \n \n How could the director and writer, John Hillcoat and Joe Penhall, have summoned the strength of McCarthy\'s writing? Could they have used more stylized visuals, instead of relentless realism? A grainy black-and-white look to suggest severely limited resources? I have no idea. Perhaps McCarthy, like Faulkner, is all but unfilmable. \n \n \n \n The one great film of his work is the Coens\' ""No Country for Old Men,"" but it began with an extraordinary character and surrounded him with others. The Road is not fertile soil, providing a world with life draining from it. McCarthy\'s greatest novels are Suttree and Blood Meridian. The second, set in the Old West, is about a fearsome, bald, skeletal man named Judge Holden, who is implacable in his desire to inflict suffering and death. (""Blood Meridian"" is being prepared by Todd Field, director of ""In the Bedroom."") \n \n \n \n Hillcoat\'s earlier film, ""The Proposition"" (2005), written by Nick Cave, seems almost McCarthy-like. Something in McCarthy\'s work draws Hillcoat to it, and you must be a brave director to let that happen. Writing this, I realize few audience members can be expected to have read The Road, even though it was a selection of Oprah\'s Book Club. Fewer still will have read McCarthy\'s other works. \n \n \n \n I\'ve been saying for years that a film critic must review the film before him, and not how ""faithful"" the film is to the book -- as if we\'re married to the book, and somehow screen adaptation is adultery. I realize my own fault is in being so very familiar with Cormac McCarthy. That may affect my ability to view any film adaptation of his work afresh. When I know a novel is bring filmed, I make it a point to not read the book. Yet I am grateful for having read McCarthy\'s.', 'In “The Road,’’ the world has ended with a bang and a whimper. Author Cormac McCarthy’s lean prose has been lifted off the printed page and laid carefully into the soundtrack like antique china in a packing crate. “The clocks stopped at 1:17,’’ says the narrator. “A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions.’’ That’s all we know about the apocalypse and all we need to know. \n \n The movie takes place in an America that has been turned into an ash heap, with skeletal human survivors picking their way across the cinders. Kept rigorously in the foreground are a Man (Viggo Mortensen) and a Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee), the latter born shortly after the end came and thus a creature exclusively of this fallen world. \n \n The two are traveling from the interior to the coast before winter comes - that’s the action of the movie. That, and keeping clear of marauding bands of men who would gladly skin them and eat them. Also, as the boy reminds his father, the two “carry the fire,’’ whatever that means. It could refer to decency and goodness, the guttering spark of humanity. It could just mean they’re still alive. \n \n “The Road’’ has been poured straight from McCarthy’s bleak bottle and brought to the screen by Australian John Hillcoat, who turned the 2005 Outback Western “The Proposition’’ into an epic of blasted landscapes and bloody motivations. He’s the man for the job, yet in adapting this harsh, unyielding book for the screen, Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall pull their punches the slightest degree and thus too much. \n \n Or maybe movies can only dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at. Hillcoat’s “Road’’ is true to the book’s profoundly moving post-nuclear stoicism, but it can’t quite get those biblical cadences that make McCarthy such a transfixing read. The Coens managed it with “No Country for Old Men,’’ so it can be done, but you have to be willing to go all the way into the dark. As a colleague said after seeing this movie, you need to show the baby on the spit. “The Road’’ doesn’t dare, can’t dare, and is the lesser thing. \n \n What’s on the screen is disturbing enough. (Even at that, it has taken a year for the Weinsteins, the producers and distributors of “The Road,’’ to get the nerve to release the film.) As the Man and the Boy drag their shopping cart across what’s left of America, the enormity of the cataclysm is glimpsed forward and backward. A wife (Charlize Theron) who may have been the braver for opting out. An impossibly old man (Robert Duvall) like a figure out of “Godot,’’ unable to go on but still going on. A trap door in a kitchen that leads to something you’d better not think about. \n \n There are other basements and further revelations in “The Road,’’ but Hillcoat avoids jack-in-the-box suspense clichés; the movie plods with a literalism that’s at times too reverent (as is Nick Cave’s score, piling on a sensitive “mournfulness’’ both redundant and unnecessary). Mortensen underplays his role admirably, and Smit-McPhee is gratifyingly unactorly. At the movie’s best we see their relationship shift as something crucial and inarticulate is passed from one generation to the next. \n \n Like all end-of-the-world fiction, “The Road’’ brings iconic meaning to the smallest of gestures. A single kindness becomes the hope of humanity; a cruel act the path to hell. If I have mixed feelings about the movie, it’s because Hillcoat honors the story’s minimalism without bringing his own sensibilities to bear on the material. He’s spooked by the responsibility, and maybe he’s right: When the director does add a single furry detail to the final scenes, it feels like a surrender to sentiment. \n \n At the same time, everything about the film is a welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of “2012,’’ a movie that turns mass extinction into the Greatest Show on Earth. In “The Road,’’ what has been lost is recognized as infinitely precious; what’s left is bitter and our due. \n \n Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com.

Critics have mixed feelings about the bleak post-apocalyptic film. Here’s what they’re saying: Despite good acting, the film is merely adequate, “an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book,” writes Kenneth Turan of the LA Times. “To do more than horrify and depress us, The Road is in need of a finer sensibility.” A devoted Cormac McCarthy fan, Roger Ebert wrestles with his review. “It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling,” he writes. “I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers.” The movie can only “dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at,” says Ty Burr of the Boston Globe. Still, it’s a “welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of 2012.” “The Road isn't a masterpiece,” writes Steven Rea in the Philadelphia Inquirer. But it stuck with him, “its images of dread and fear kicking around like such a terrible dream.”"

The Israeli military, however, said Abu Latyef was a civilian. \n \n The Israeli defense minister, Moshe Ya\'alon, said Israel holds Hamas responsible for the shooting. \n \n ""We will not allow life in the south to be disturbed, and we will react in the sternest and gravest way to any attack on our sovereignty and injuries of our civilians and soldiers,"" Ya\'alon said in a statement released by the defense ministry. \n \n U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is concerned about the violence, condemns Abu Latyef\'s killing and deplores the death of the Gaza girl and other Palestinian civilian casualties, his spokesman said Tuesday. \n \n The Israeli military said Abu Latyef was the first Israeli civilian killed near the Gaza Strip since it launched a series of attacks there last year. \n \n In Israel\'s ""Pillar of Defense"" operation in November 2012, the country\'s military launched strikes on Gaza designed to stop constant rocket fire. Eight days of round-the-clock warfare followed between Israel and Hamas. More than 160 Palestinians, many of whom were civilians, were killed. Six Israelis died, including civilians and soldiers. \n \n Journalist Talal Abu Rahma reported from Gaza City; CNN\'s Michael Schwartz reported from Bethlehem in the West Bank. CNN\'s Saad Abedine, Hamdi Alkhshali, Kareem Khadder and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.', 'Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \n \n A civilian working for the Defense Ministry was shot and killed on Tuesday from Palestinian sniper fire, while working to fix damages caused to the Israeli-Gaza border fence caused by the recent winter storm. \n \n \n \n Salah Shukri Abu Latyef, 22, from Rahat, was working for Shabbat Drilling operating a tractor at the Gaza border when he was shot and struck in the center of his chest by a Palestinian sniper, according to the army\'s assessment. \n \n \n \n He was airlifted to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba where he later succumbed to his wounds. \n \n \n \n Israeli media reported that the Palestinian militant group Popular Resistance Committees claimed responsibility for the shooting. \n \n \n \n ""The incident occurred very close to the border,"" one security source said. \n \n \n \n ""This was his first day working on the Gaza Strip border and unfortunately it was also his last day of life,"" Latyef\'s cousin said. \n \n \n \n An IDF spokesman said that the military had limited the access of farmers working in the immediate vicinity of the fence in the aftermath of the attack. \n \n \n \n Israel clamped restrictions in the past on Palestinians working inside the Gaza Strip near the security fence to prevent exactly the type of sniper incident that killed an Israeli defense ministry worker on Tuesday, government officials said. \n \n \n \n The easing of those restrictions were part of the understandings brokered by Egypt that brought an end in November 2012 to Operation Pillar of Defense against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. \n \n \n \n Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu characterized the attack a ""very grave incident"" that Israel would not let go unanswered. This attack, unlike the other terror attacks this week, elicited a quick and immediate response from Netanyahu. \n \n \n \n ""Our policy up until now has been to prevent beforehand and to react with force, and this is how we will act now as well,"" he said. \n \n \n \n Government sources said Netanyahu viewed this incident as particularly serious both within the context of the string of other attacks this week – the foiled bus bomb in Bat Yam, the rocket fire from Gaza and the knifing of a Border Patrolman outside of Jerusalem – and also because it was such a clear violation of the understandings that brought an end to Operation Pillar of Defense. \n \n \n \n According to those understandings, Israel eased restriction on Gazans working close to security fence that were clamped on the area because of security concerns. \n \n \n \n Netanyahu made his comment as he was just about to fly back to Jerusalem from Sderot, where he went Tuesday to dedicate the new Tel Aviv-Sderot train line. \n \n \n \n Netanyahu said that Israel would not tolerate a ""drizzle"" of attacks from Gaza that would ""turn into a storm."" \n \n \n \n Since Operation Pillar of Defense last year, he said the south has been quieter than it has been for more than a decade. ""I am committed to maintaining that quiet, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That is our policy."" \n \n \n \n The cross-border shooting comes after a spate of attempts by Palestinians to plant explosives along the security fence and to damage the barrier in recent days. \n \n \n \n Defense Minister Moshe Ya\'alon said there was ""no direct relation"" between terrorist attacks in Israel over the past two days and the cross-border shooting attack. \n \n \n \n ""We view take a most severe view of them. In Gaza, Hamas is sovereign, and we see it as being responsible for today\'s shooting from the Strip and rocket launches over the past today at Israel. We will not allow a disruption to life in the South, and we will respond decisively and painfully to attacks on our sovereignty and against our civilians and soldiers,"" the defense minister added. \n \n \n \n He advised Hamas ""not to test our patience,"" calling on Gaza\'s ruling regime to exercise its authority on the ground to prevent further attacks on Israel by other organizations. \n \n \n \n ""If there won\'t be quiet in Israel, there won\'t be quiet in Gaza either,"" Ya\'alon warned. \n \n \n \n ""Terrorism incidents are the continuation of previous attacks, most of which are the result of a lone attacker, or one who has been influenced by the atmosphere of incitement and hatred that exists in the Palestinian Authority against Israel. This is an intolerable situation from our perspective, and despite the difficulties in dealing with a lone individual incited to murder Jews, we will act with a resolute hand and in various ways to harm anyone who tries to carry out terrorist attacks,"" Ya\'alon pledged. \n \n \n \n As long as the PA continues to incite against Israel and its civilians, and fails to promote a culture of peace, Israel will have to deal with attacks that result from this, he added. Ya\'alon sent his condolences to the family of the fatally wounded civilian, and wished the policeman stabbed on Monday a swift recovery. \n \n \n \n Ya\'alon ordered the closing of the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Tuesday evening, following escalation on the Gaza border. \n \n \n \n President Shimon Peres said that ""Israel will ensure its own security"" and advised Hamas and the Islamic Jihad to stop aggressions against Israel. \n \n \n \n ""If Gaza wants it to be quiet, it must remain quiet, otherwise it will suffer the consequences of the unrest many times over,"" Peres said. \n \n \n \n ""Gaza is not under any occupation. It is playing with fire. The world will not continue supporting Gaza if it continues killing innocent people,"" the president added. \n \n \n \n Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein said the attack ""proves that Hamas and its satellite organizations are determined to harm Israeli citizens without any connection to their religion or ideology."" \n \n \n \n ""The trickle of attacks must stop and life near Gaza must be stable and safe,"" Edelstein added, sending his condolences to the victim\'s family. \n \n \n \n Opposition leader Isaac Herzog (Labor) said he is certain that the recent wave of terror is meant to sabotage peace talks and the possibility of a two-state solution. \n \n \n \n ""We will not give in to terror and will not let it win or determine the State of Israel\'s interests,"" Herzog stated. ""I trust that the IDF and security forces will act against terror."" \n \n \n \n However, some on the right did not share Herzog\'s determination to continue negotiating. \n \n \n \n ""The deterioration in security shows once again that the Palestinians don\'t want peace,"" Deputy Minister for Liaison with the Knesset Ofir Akunis said. ""This is a direct result of the Palestinian incitement against Israel."" \n \n \n \n Knesset Finance Committee chairman Nissan Slomiansky (Bayit Yehudi) said the next release of terrorists from prison, which is planned for next week, should be canceled, calling it ""absurd."" \n \n \n \n ""Day after day Israeli residents\' lives are endangered and the government continues blindly giving in to the demands of the Palestinian Authority and the Americans. We should put an end to this farce. As long as terror against Israel continues, we cannot release even one terrorist,"" Slomiansky stated. \n \n \n \n In a separate incident, a Palestinian youth who approached the fence on the border with northern Gaza entered the closed security zone, and ignored calls by soldiers to vacate the area. He was shot in the leg and evacuated to a Gazan hospital by the Red Crescent. \n \n \n \n Lahav Harkov and Yasser Okbi contributed to this report.']",2,"– Israel launched an airstrike in the Gaza Strip today, in retaliation for the shooting of an Israeli working on the border fence, the Israeli military said, according to the AP. The military gave no hint as to its target or how many casualties it may have inflicted, but Hamas security sources tell CNN that one 4-year-old girl was killed in the strike, and three others were wounded. All four belonged to a family that lived near an al Qassam Brigades camp that the attack appeared to be targeting. A Palestinian sniper shot Salah Shukri Abu Latyef, a 22-year-old civilian engineer, earlier today, the Jerusalem Post reports. He was airlifted to the hospital, where he died of his wounds. Benjamin Netanyahu called it a ""very grave incident,"" and promised to ""react with force"" in accordance with longstanding policy. Palestinians have launched a series of attacks on Israeli targets in recent days; Israeli soldiers have fired on Palestinian suspects five times since Friday, including an incident yesterday in which they spotted a man planting a bomb and fired at his legs."

They didn’t know it was me.” \n \n Mr. Durham, in details that he shares for the first time, after years of claiming innocence, brags of doing “bank jobs, safety deposit and more spectacular jobs than this.” He says he targeted the museum not because of any interest in art but simply because he could. “That’s the eye of a burglar,” he boasts. \n \n The works are of inestimable value because they have never been to market: “View of the Sea at Scheveningen” (1882) is one of only two seascapes van Gogh painted during his years in the Netherlands, and “Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen” (1882-84), showing the church where the artist’s father was a pastor, was a gift to the artist’s mother. \n \n (Prices for van Gogh landscape paintings at auction range from about $10 million to about $70 million.) \n \n But Mr. Durham did not know the historical background of the paintings. He said the paintings were the smallest ones in the gallery he targeted, and closest to the hole through which he entered. He stuffed them into a bag, and escaped by sliding down a rope he and his accomplice had put in place. When he hit the ground, he came down so hard that he smashed the seascape, chipping the paint. He left behind a black baseball cap. A security guard called the police, but she was not permitted to use force to try to stop the burglars.', 'One of two men convicted for stealing two paintings from the Van Gogh Museum in 2002, told his story to the Telegraaf over the weekend. Octave Durham told the newspaper that he and companion Henk B. actually wanted to steal the famous paintings Sunflowers and The Potato Eaters, but the first was too well guarded and the second was too large to fit through the window they broke to get into the museum. \n \n Durham and B. eventually made off with two other paintings - Seafront at Scheveningen and Congregation leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen. These paintings were recovered from the Italian mafia last year. Durham would not tell the newspaper how much the Italian mafia paid for them. ""I will not mention an amount. Otherwise I\'ll get a surcharge from the tax authorities"", he said. \n \n The paintings were only sold to the Italian mafia after failed attempts to sell them in the Netherlands. Durham and B. initially wanted to sell the paintings to criminal Sam Klepper, but he was assassinated shortly before the robbery. Afterwards they contacted Heineken-kidnapper Cor van Hout, but he too was assassinated before he could buy the paintings. \n \n For years Durham denied having anything to do with the robbery in the museum in Amsterdam. He was still convicted in 2005 and sentenced to 3.5 years in prison. \n \n After being recovered, the two paintings were initially considered evidence in the Italian authorities\' case against the mafia. But in January a court ruled that they could be released and returned to the Netherlands.']",2,"– ""I'm a born burglar,"" says Octave Durham, per the New York Times, which looks at a new documentary about Durham's notorious theft of two Vincent Van Gogh paintings. Set to be broadcast Tuesday on Dutch TV, the 45-minute special by filmmaker Vincent Verweij gets the inside scoop on the 2002 heist Durham says took less than four minutes and nabbed him two works the Times deems ""of inestimable value"": Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen and View of the Sea at Scheveningen. Durham, who was convicted for the burglary in 2004 and spent just over two years in prison, says he passed cops in his getaway car and brags that he'd pulled off ""more spectacular jobs than this""—after years of denying he had any involvement in the theft, per Versopolis.com. In one reveal that may insult art lovers everywhere, Durham notes he didn't run off with the Van Goghs because of any particular love for the great master, or for art in general: He did it because it was an opportunity for a big get. ""That's the eye of a burglar,"" he says. Per NLTimes.com, Durham told a Dutch paper over the weekend he'd wanted to steal two other Van Gogh paintings—Sunflowers and The Potato Eaters—but one was too big to slip out and the other was under heavy security, so he and partner Henk Bieslijn settled on the other two. The Times notes the Van Gogh Museum is still ""furious"" with Durham, who didn't get paid for the film, and refused to help Verweij. The filmmaker defends his choice of cinematic subject, noting, ""You never see documentaries or articles about art theft from the perspective of the thief."" (The Van Gogh Museum was pretty stoked when the paintings were recovered.)"

I\'m very pleased to be doing what I\'m doing as secretary of state."" \n \n In a separate interview with TV New Zealand, Clinton said she hoped the United States was ready for a female president, adding ""it should be."" \n \n Asked if it might be her, she replied: ""Well, not me. But it will be someone and it is nice coming to countries that have already proven that they can elect women to the highest governing positions that they have in their systems."" \n \n New Zealand -- whose former prime ministers include Helen Clark and Jenny Shipley -- is the second-to-last stop on a nearly two-week Asia-Pacific tour that Clinton wraps up in Australia, whose current prime minister is Julia Gillard. \n \n In Tuesday\'s election, Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives, where the Republicans gained at least 60 members. As of Thursday, Democrats held on to the Senate with a 51-seat majority but the Republicans gained six seats there. \n \n The Democrats\' poor showing has been widely interpreted as a referendum on U.S. President Barak Obama, raising questions about who the party may field as its candidate in 2012, when he would be expected to run for re-election, and 2016. \n \n (Editing by Sugita Katyal)', 'Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aimed to defuse speculation about another presidential run Friday, telling New Zealand television that she\'s very pleased to serve as Secretary of State. \n \n Asked by New Zealand TV3\'s Duncan Garner Friday, ""Just looking long term, do you still rule out standing for top office, for president?"" \n \n ""Yes,"" Clinton said. \n \n Garner continued: ""Even as going as far as 2016?"" \n \n ""Oh yes, yes,"" Clinton reiterated. ""I’m very pleased to be doing what I’m doing as Secretary of State."" \n \n Does that constitute Clinton ruling out a 2016 run, as the Reuters\' take on her comments suggests? \n \n Not necessarily. Clinton says she\'s enjoying her job as Secretary of State too much to get into the presidential race. But in 2016, she almost certainly will not be Secretary of State anymore. \n \n (Clinton may also have been even more careful than usual to try to squelch political speculation about herself given the fact that New Zealand Prime Minister John Phillip Key accidentally introduced her yesterday as ""President Clinton"" before correcting himself.) \n \n In the interview Friday, Clinton also sought to defend President Barack Obama and put the Democrats\' losses in the midterms Tuesday in perspective. \n \n Asked if this was a bigger than normal midterm rout such as that her husband experienced in 1994, Clinton acknowledged, ""It\'s big,"" but added, ""but it is not out of the pattern of historical political elections."" \n \n ""But what I think the President made very clear was he made decisions which were essential for the well-being of the American people,"" Clinton continued. \n \n ""It may not have been popular to do what had to be done with the stimulus and some of the other actions he took on the economy, but many of us believe it prevented even worse economic consequences,"" Clinton said.

""They’re a very important part of our market in New Zealand, so we see Trans-Pacific Partnership as a very important item to be completed if at all possible. So, President Clinton ..."" ... \n \n \n \n Laughter — and applause — ensued, according to the State Department\'s transcript, and Key was forced to correct himself. \n \n \n \n ""I’m sorry. Secretary Clinton — great,"" he said. ""I thank you for your time here in New Zealand, and I look forward to seeing President Obama when he is here in Japan next week.""']",3,"– A day after being accidentally introduced as ""President Clinton,"" Hillary seems to be taking pains to kill talk of a future run in New Zealand's media, reports Reuters. Asked whether she'd ""ruled out"" running through 2016, she replied, ""Oh yes, yes. I'm very pleased to be doing what I'm doing as secretary of state."" Asked in another interview whether she could be the first female president, she answered, ""Well, not me. But it will be someone ..."" The significance? Probably not much, writes Laura Rozen in Politico, noting how one of Clinton's answers is tied to her being secretary of state—a post she likely won't hold in 2016.

58,"['Tech-savvy rightwingers have been able to ‘game’ the algorithms of internet giants and create a new reality where Hitler is a good guy, Jews are evil and… Donald Trump becomes president \n \n Here’s what you don’t want to do late on a Sunday night. You do not want to type seven letters into Google. That’s all I did. I typed: “a-r-e”. And then “j-e-w-s”. Since 2008, Google has attempted to predict what question you might be asking and offers you a choice. And this is what it did. It offered me a choice of potential questions it thought I might want to ask: “are jews a race?”, “are jews white?”, “are jews christians?”, and finally, “are jews evil?” \n \n Are Jews evil? It’s not a question I’ve ever thought of asking. I hadn’t gone looking for it. But there it was. I press enter. A page of results appears. This was Google’s question. And this was Google’s answer: Jews are evil. Because there, on my screen, was the proof: an entire page of results, nine out of 10 of which “confirm” this. The top result, from a site called Listovative, has the headline: “Top 10 Major Reasons Why People Hate Jews.” I click on it: “Jews today have taken over marketing, militia, medicinal, technological, media, industrial, cinema challenges etc and continue to face the worlds [sic] envy through unexplained success stories given their inglorious past and vermin like repression all over Europe.” \n \n Google is search. It’s the verb, to Google. It’s what we all do, all the time, whenever we want to know anything. We Google it. The site handles at least 63,000 searches a second, 5.5bn a day. Its mission as a company, the one-line overview that has informed the company since its foundation and is still the banner headline on its corporate website today, is to “organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. It strives to give you the best, most relevant results. And in this instance the third-best, most relevant result to the search query “are Jews… ” is a link to an article from stormfront.org, a neo-Nazi website. The fifth is a YouTube video: “Why the Jews are Evil. Why we are against them.” \n \n The sixth is from Yahoo Answers: “Why are Jews so evil?” The seventh result is: “Jews are demonic souls from a different world.” And the 10th is from jesus-is-saviour.com: “Judaism is Satanic!” \n \n There’s one result in the 10 that offers a different point of view. It’s a link to a rather dense, scholarly book review from thetabletmag.com, a Jewish magazine, with the unfortunately misleading headline: “Why Literally Everybody In the World Hates Jews.” \n \n I feel like I’ve fallen down a wormhole, entered some parallel universe where black is white, and good is bad. Though later, I think that perhaps what I’ve actually done is scraped the topsoil off the surface of 2016 and found one of the underground springs that has been quietly nurturing it. It’s been there all the time, of course. Just a few keystrokes away… on our laptops, our tablets, our phones. This isn’t a secret Nazi cell lurking in the shadows. It’s hiding in plain sight. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Are women… Google’s search results. \n \n Stories about fake news on Facebook have dominated certain sections of the press for weeks following the American presidential election, but arguably this is even more powerful, more insidious. Frank Pasquale, professor of law at the University of Maryland, and one of the leading academic figures calling for tech companies to be more open and transparent, calls the results “very profound, very troubling”. \n \n He came across a similar instance in 2006 when, “If you typed ‘Jew’ in Google, the first result was jewwatch.org. It was ‘look out for these awful Jews who are ruining your life’. And the Anti-Defamation League went after them and so they put an asterisk next to it which said: ‘These search results may be disturbing but this is an automated process.’ But what you’re showing – and I’m very glad you are documenting it and screenshotting it – is that despite the fact they have vastly researched this problem, it has gotten vastly worse.” \n \n And ordering of search results does influence people, says Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, London, who has written at length on the impact of the big tech companies on our civic and political spheres. “There’s large-scale, statistically significant research into the impact of search results on political views. And the way in which you see the results and the types of results you see on the page necessarily has an impact on your perspective.” Fake news, he says, has simply “revealed a much bigger problem. These companies are so powerful and so committed to disruption. They thought they were disrupting politics but in a positive way. They hadn’t thought about the downsides. These tools offer remarkable empowerment, but there’s a dark side to it. It enables people to do very cynical, damaging things.” \n \n Google is knowledge. It’s where you go to find things out. And evil Jews are just the start of it. There are also evil women. I didn’t go looking for them either. This is what I type: “a-r-e w-o-m-e-n”. And Google offers me just two choices, the first of which is: “Are women evil?” I press return. Yes, they are. Every one of the 10 results “confirms” that they are, including the top one, from a site called sheddingoftheego.com, which is boxed out and highlighted: “Every woman has some degree of prostitute in her. Every woman has a little evil in her… Women don’t love men, they love what they can do for them. It is within reason to say women feel attraction but they cannot love men.” \n \n Next I type: “a-r-e m-u-s-l-i-m-s”. And Google suggests I should ask: “Are Muslims bad?” And here’s what I find out: yes, they are. That’s what the top result says and six of the others. Without typing anything else, simply putting the cursor in the search box, Google offers me two new searches and I go for the first, “Islam is bad for society”. In the next list of suggestions, I’m offered: “Islam must be destroyed.” \n \n This is the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate Danny Sullivan \n \n Jews are evil. Muslims need to be eradicated. And Hitler? Do you want to know about Hitler? Let’s Google it. “Was Hitler bad?” I type. And here’s Google’s top result: “10 Reasons Why Hitler Was One Of The Good Guys” I click on the link: “He never wanted to kill any Jews”; “he cared about conditions for Jews in the work camps”; “he implemented social and cultural reform.” Eight out of the other 10 search results agree: Hitler really wasn’t that bad. \n \n A few days later, I talk to Danny Sullivan, the founding editor of SearchEngineLand.com. He’s been recommended to me by several academics as one of the most knowledgeable experts on search. Am I just being naive, I ask him? Should I have known this was out there? “No, you’re not being naive,” he says. “This is awful. It’s horrible. It’s the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate. Google is doing a horrible, horrible job of delivering answers here. It can and should do better.” \n \n He’s surprised too. “I thought they stopped offering autocomplete suggestions for religions in 2011.” And then he types “are women” into his own computer. “Good lord! That answer at the top. It’s a featured result. It’s called a “direct answer”. This is supposed to be indisputable. It’s Google’s highest endorsement.” That every women has some degree of prostitute in her? “Yes. This is Google’s algorithm going terribly wrong.” \n \n I contacted Google about its seemingly malfunctioning autocomplete suggestions and received the following response: “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs – as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.” \n \n Google isn’t just a search engine, of course. Search was the foundation of the company but that was just the beginning. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, now has the greatest concentration of artificial intelligence experts in the world. It is expanding into healthcare, transportation, energy. It’s able to attract the world’s top computer scientists, physicists and engineers. It’s bought hundreds of start-ups, including Calico, whose stated mission is to “cure death” and DeepMind, which aims to “solve intelligence”. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2002. Photograph: Michael Grecco/Getty Images \n \n And 20 years ago it didn’t even exist. When Tony Blair became prime minister, it wasn’t possible to Google him: the search engine had yet to be invented. The company was only founded in 1998 and Facebook didn’t appear until 2004. Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are still only 43. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is 32. Everything they’ve done, the world they’ve remade, has been done in the blink of an eye. \n \n But it seems the implications about the power and reach of these companies is only now seeping into the public consciousness. I ask Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation, whether it was the recent furore over fake news that woke people up to the danger of ceding our rights as citizens to corporations. “It’s kind of weird right now,” she says, “because people are finally saying, ‘Gee, Facebook and Google really have a lot of power’ like it’s this big revelation. And it’s like, ‘D’oh.’” \n \n MacKinnon has a particular expertise in how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and bend it to their purposes. “China and Russia are a cautionary tale for us. I think what happens is that it goes back and forth. So during the Arab spring, it seemed like the good guys were further ahead. And now it seems like the bad guys are. Pro-democracy activists are using the internet more than ever but at the same time, the adversary has gotten so much more skilled.” \n \n Last week Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University in North Carolina, published the first detailed research on how rightwing websites had spread their message. “I took a list of these fake news sites that was circulating, I had an initial list of 306 of them and I used a tool – like the one Google uses – to scrape them for links and then I mapped them. So I looked at where the links went – into YouTube and Facebook, and between each other, millions of them… and I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing. \n \n “They have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn’t a conspiracy. There isn’t one person who’s created this. It’s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They’re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system.” \n \n He found 23,000 pages and 1.3m hyperlinks. “And Facebook is just the amplification device. When you look at it in 3D, it actually looks like a virus. And Facebook was just one of the hosts for the virus that helps it spread faster. You can see the New York Times in there and the Washington Post and then you can see how there’s a vast, vast network surrounding them. The best way of describing it is as an ecosystem. This really goes way beyond individual sites or individual stories. What this map shows is the distribution network and you can see that it’s surrounding and actually choking the mainstream news ecosystem.” \n \n Like a cancer? “Like an organism that is growing and getting stronger all the time.” \n \n Charlie Beckett, a professor in the school of media and communications at LSE, tells me: “We’ve been arguing for some time now that plurality of news media is good. Diversity is good. Critiquing the mainstream media is good. But now… it’s gone wildly out of control. What Jonathan Albright’s research has shown is that this isn’t a byproduct of the internet. And it’s not even being done for commercial reasons. It’s motivated by ideology, by people who are quite deliberately trying to destabilise the internet.” \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest A spatial map of the rightwing fake news ecosystem. Jonathan Albright, assistant professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, “scraped” 300 fake news sites (the dark shapes on this map) to reveal the 1.3m hyperlinks that connect them together and link them into the mainstream news ecosystem. Here, Albright shows it is a “vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system”. Photograph: Jonathan Albright \n \n Albright’s map also provides a clue to understanding the Google search results I found. What these rightwing news sites have done, he explains, is what most commercial websites try to do. They try to find the tricks that will move them up Google’s PageRank system. They try and “game” the algorithm. And what his map shows is how well they’re doing that. \n \n That’s what my searches are showing too. That the right has colonised the digital space around these subjects – Muslims, women, Jews, the Holocaust, black people – far more effectively than the liberal left. \n \n “It’s an information war,” says Albright. “That’s what I keep coming back to.” \n \n But it’s where it goes from here that’s truly frightening. I ask him how it can be stopped. “I don’t know. I’m not sure it can be. It’s a network. It’s far more powerful than any one actor.” \n \n So, it’s almost got a life of its own? “Yes, and it’s learning. Every day, it’s getting stronger.” \n \n The more people who search for information about Jews, the more people will see links to hate sites, and the more they click on those links (very few people click on to the second page of results) the more traffic the sites will get, the more links they will accrue and the more authoritative they will appear. This is an entirely circular knowledge economy that has only one outcome: an amplification of the message. Jews are evil. Women are evil. Islam must be destroyed. Hitler was one of the good guys. \n \n Fake news and a 400-year-old problem: we need to resolve the ‘post-truth’ crisis Read more \n \n And the constellation of websites that Albright found – a sort of shadow internet – has another function. More than just spreading rightwing ideology, they are being used to track and monitor and influence anyone who comes across their content. “I scraped the trackers on these sites and I was absolutely dumbfounded. Every time someone likes one of these posts on Facebook or visits one of these websites, the scripts are then following you around the web. And this enables data-mining and influencing companies like Cambridge Analytica to precisely target individuals, to follow them around the web, and to send them highly personalised political messages. This is a propaganda machine. It’s targeting people individually to recruit them to an idea. It’s a level of social engineering that I’ve never seen before. They’re capturing people and then keeping them on an emotional leash and never letting them go.” \n \n Cambridge Analytica, an American-owned company based in London, was employed by both the Vote Leave campaign and the Trump campaign. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, has made few public announcements since the Brexit referendum but he did say this: “If you want to make big improvements in communication, my advice is – hire physicists.” \n \n Steve Bannon, founder of Breitbart News and the newly appointed chief strategist to Trump, is on Cambridge Analytica’s board and it has emerged that the company is in talks to undertake political messaging work for the Trump administration. It claims to have built psychological profiles using 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters. It knows their quirks and nuances and daily habits and can target them individually. \n \n “They were using 40-50,000 different variants of ad every day that were continuously measuring responses and then adapting and evolving based on that response,” says Martin Moore of Kings College. Because they have so much data on individuals and they use such phenomenally powerful distribution networks, they allow campaigns to bypass a lot of existing laws. \n \n “It’s all done completely opaquely and they can spend as much money as they like on particular locations because you can focus on a five-mile radius or even a single demographic. Fake news is important but it’s only one part of it. These companies have found a way of transgressing 150 years of legislation that we’ve developed to make elections fair and open.” \n \n Did such micro-targeted propaganda – currently legal – swing the Brexit vote? We have no way of knowing. Did the same methods used by Cambridge Analytica help Trump to victory? Again, we have no way of knowing. This is all happening in complete darkness. We have no way of knowing how our personal data is being mined and used to influence us. We don’t realise that the Facebook page we are looking at, the Google page, the ads that we are seeing, the search results we are using, are all being personalised to us. We don’t see it because we have nothing to compare it to. And it is not being monitored or recorded. It is not being regulated. We are inside a machine and we simply have no way of seeing the controls. Most of the time, we don’t even realise that there are controls. \n \n Facebook and Google move to kick fake news sites off their ad networks Read more \n \n Rebecca MacKinnon says that most of us consider the internet to be like “the air that we breathe and the water that we drink”. It surrounds us. We use it. And we don’t question it. “But this is not a natural landscape. Programmers and executives and editors and designers, they make this landscape. They are human beings and they all make choices.” \n \n But we don’t know what choices they are making. Neither Google or Facebook make their algorithms public. Why did my Google search return nine out of 10 search results that claim Jews are evil? We don’t know and we have no way of knowing. Their systems are what Frank Pasquale describes as “black boxes”. He calls Google and Facebook “a terrifying duopoly of power” and has been leading a growing movement of academics who are calling for “algorithmic accountability”. “We need to have regular audits of these systems,” he says. “We need people in these companies to be accountable. In the US, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, every company has to have a spokesman you can reach. And this is what needs to happen. They need to respond to complaints about hate speech, about bias.” \n \n Is bias built into the system? Does it affect the kind of results that I was seeing? “There’s all sorts of bias about what counts as a legitimate source of information and how that’s weighted. There’s enormous commercial bias. And when you look at the personnel, they are young, white and perhaps Asian, but not black or Hispanic and they are overwhelmingly men. The worldview of young wealthy white men informs all these judgments.” \n \n Later, I speak to Robert Epstein, a research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioural Research and Technology, and the author of the study that Martin Moore told me about (and that Google has publicly criticised), showing how search-rank results affect voting patterns. On the other end of the phone, he repeats one of the searches I did. He types “do blacks…” into Google. \n \n “Look at that. I haven’t even hit a button and it’s automatically populated the page with answers to the query: ‘Do blacks commit more crimes?’ And look, I could have been going to ask all sorts of questions. ‘Do blacks excel at sports’, or anything. And it’s only given me two choices and these aren’t simply search-based or the most searched terms right now. Google used to use that but now they use an algorithm that looks at other things. Now, let me look at Bing and Yahoo. I’m on Yahoo and I have 10 suggestions, not one of which is ‘Do black people commit more crime?’ \n \n “And people don’t question this. Google isn’t just offering a suggestion. This is a negative suggestion and we know that negative suggestions depending on lots of things can draw between five and 15 more clicks. And this all programmed. And it could be programmed differently.” \n \n What Epstein’s work has shown is that the contents of a page of search results can influence people’s views and opinions. The type and order of search rankings was shown to influence voters in India in double-blind trials. There were similar results relating to the search suggestions you are offered. \n \n “The general public are completely in the dark about very fundamental issues regarding online search and influence. We are talking about the most powerful mind-control machine ever invented in the history of the human race. And people don’t even notice it.” \n \n Good luck in making Google reveal its algorithm | John Naughton Read more \n \n Damien Tambini, an associate professor at the London School of Economics, who focuses on media regulation, says that we lack any sort of framework to deal with the potential impact of these companies on the democratic process. “We have structures that deal with powerful media corporations. We have competition laws. But these companies are not being held responsible. There are no powers to get Google or Facebook to disclose anything. There’s an editorial function to Google and Facebook but it’s being done by sophisticated algorithms. They say it’s machines not editors. But that’s simply a mechanised editorial function.” \n \n And the companies, says John Naughton, the Observer columnist and a senior research fellow at Cambridge University, are terrified of acquiring editorial responsibilities they don’t want. “Though they can and regularly do tweak the results in all sorts of ways.” \n \n Certainly the results about Google on Google don’t seem entirely neutral. Google “Is Google racist?” and the featured result – the Google answer boxed out at the top of the page – is quite clear: no. It is not. \n \n Google and Facebook are thinking long term. They have the resources, money and ambition to do whatever they want John Naughton \n \n But the enormity and complexity of having two global companies of a kind we have never seen before influencing so many areas of our lives is such, says Naughton, that “we don’t even have the mental apparatus to even know what the problems are”. \n \n And this is especially true of the future. Google and Facebook are at the forefront of AI. They are going to own the future. And the rest of us can barely start to frame the sorts of questions we ought to be asking. “Politicians don’t think long term. And corporations don’t think long term because they’re focused on the next quarterly results and that’s what makes Google and Facebook interesting and different. They are absolutely thinking long term. They have the resources, the money, and the ambition to do whatever they want. \n \n “They want to digitise every book in the world: they do it. They want to build a self-driving car: they do it. The fact that people are reading about these fake news stories and realising that this could have an effect on politics and elections, it’s like, ‘Which planet have you been living on?’ For Christ’s sake, this is obvious.” \n \n “The internet is among the few things that humans have built that they don’t understand.” It is “the largest experiment involving anarchy in history. Hundreds of millions of people are, each minute, creating and consuming an untold amount of digital content in an online world that is not truly bound by terrestrial laws.” The internet as a lawless anarchic state? A massive human experiment with no checks and balances and untold potential consequences? What kind of digital doom-mongerer would say such a thing? Step forward, Eric Schmidt – Google’s chairman. They are the first lines of the book, The New Digital Age, that he wrote with Jared Cohen. \n \n We don’t understand it. It is not bound by terrestrial laws. And it’s in the hands of two massive, all-powerful corporations. It’s their experiment, not ours. The technology that was supposed to set us free may well have helped Trump to power, or covertly helped swing votes for Brexit. It has created a vast network of propaganda that has encroached like a cancer across the entire internet. This is a technology that has enabled the likes of Cambridge Analytica to create political messages uniquely tailored to you. They understand your emotional responses and how to trigger them. They know your likes, dislikes, where you live, what you eat, what makes you laugh, what makes you cry. \n \n And what next? Rebecca MacKinnon’s research has shown how authoritarian regimes reshape the internet for their own purposes. Is that what’s going to happen with Silicon Valley and Trump? As Martin Moore points out, the president-elect claimed that Apple chief executive Tim Cook called to congratulate him soon after his election victory. “And there will undoubtedly be be pressure on them to collaborate,” says Moore. \n \n Journalism is failing in the face of such change and is only going to fail further. New platforms have put a bomb under the financial model – advertising – resources are shrinking, traffic is increasingly dependent on them, and publishers have no access, no insight at all, into what these platforms are doing in their headquarters, their labs. And now they are moving beyond the digital world into the physical. The next frontiers are healthcare, transportation, energy. And just as Google is a near-monopoly for search, its ambition to own and control the physical infrastructure of our lives is what’s coming next. It already owns our data and with it our identity. What will it mean when it moves into all the other areas of our lives? \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: still only 32 years of age. Photograph: Mariana Bazo/Reuters \n \n “At the moment, there’s a distance when you Google ‘Jews are’ and get ‘Jews are evil’,” says Julia Powles, a researcher at Cambridge on technology and law. “But when you move into the physical realm, and these concepts become part of the tools being deployed when you navigate around your city or influence how people are employed, I think that has really pernicious consequences.” \n \n Powles is shortly to publish a paper looking at DeepMind’s relationship with the NHS. “A year ago, 2 million Londoners’ NHS health records were handed over to DeepMind. And there was complete silence from politicians, from regulators, from anyone in a position of power. This is a company without any healthcare experience being given unprecedented access into the NHS and it took seven months to even know that they had the data. And that took investigative journalism to find it out.” \n \n The headline was that DeepMind was going to work with the NHS to develop an app that would provide early warning for sufferers of kidney disease. And it is, but DeepMind’s ambitions – “to solve intelligence” – goes way beyond that. The entire history of 2 million NHS patients is, for artificial intelligence researchers, a treasure trove. And, their entry into the NHS – providing useful services in exchange for our personal data – is another massive step in their power and influence in every part of our lives. \n \n Because the stage beyond search is prediction. Google wants to know what you want before you know yourself. “That’s the next stage,” says Martin Moore. “We talk about the omniscience of these tech giants, but that omniscience takes a huge step forward again if they are able to predict. And that’s where they want to go. To predict diseases in health. It’s really, really problematic.” \n \n For the nearly 20 years that Google has been in existence, our view of the company has been inflected by the youth and liberal outlook of its founders. Ditto Facebook, whose mission, Zuckberg said, was not to be “a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and connected.” \n \n The more we argue with them, the more they know about us. It all feeds into a circular system Jonathan Albright \n \n It would be interesting to know how he thinks that’s working out. Donald Trump is connecting through exactly the same technology platforms that supposedly helped fuel the Arab spring; connecting to racists and xenophobes. And Facebook and Google are amplifying and spreading that message. And us too – the mainstream media. Our outrage is just another node on Jonathan Albright’s data map. \n \n “The more we argue with them, the more they know about us,” he says. “It all feeds into a circular system. What we’re seeing here is new era of network propaganda.” \n \n We are all points on that map. And our complicity, our credulity, being consumers not concerned citizens, is an essential part of that process. And what happens next is down to us. “I would say that everybody has been really naive and we need to reset ourselves to a much more cynical place and proceed on that basis,” is Rebecca MacKinnon’s advice. “There is no doubt that where we are now is a very bad place. But it’s we as a society who have jointly created this problem. And if we want to get to a better place, when it comes to having an information ecosystem that serves human rights and democracy instead of destroying it, we have to share responsibility for that.” \n \n Are Jews evil? How do you want that question answered? This is our internet. Not Google’s. Not Facebook’s. Not rightwing propagandists. And we’re the only ones who can reclaim it.']",1,"– Robert De Niro is set to play NFL coach Vince Lombardi, but—in more casting news from a different film—the role of Captain America is still up for grabs.

60,"['I don’t remember the first time I did it, but I remember the first time I got caught. I was a freshman at U.C. Santa Cruz, the store was called Zanotto’s, the item was Neosporin. I took it out of its packaging, bent down as if to scratch my ankle, and then wedged the tube of triple-antibiotic ointment into my white ankle sock. When the guard grabbed my arm, I was so scared I peed on the floor. As we waited for the police to come, I had to watch a janitor clean up my pee with a mop. I was taken down to the station and formally arrested: fingerprints, mug shot—they really wanted to teach this nineteen-year-old, transparent-dress-wearing punk a lesson. The lesson I learned was that I was now legally an adult, so I didn’t have to worry that my parents would be called. I was free—even my crimes belonged to me alone. \n \n In time, I improved. I discovered that stealing required a loose, casual energy, a sort of oneness with the environment, like surfing or horse-whispering. And once I knew I could do it I felt strangely obliged to. I remember feeling guilty for not stealing, as though I were wasting money. After I dropped out of college and moved to Portland, Oregon, it became part of my livelihood. I stared at my shopping list like a stressed housewife, deliberating over which items to steal and which to buy with food stamps. My preferred purse was gigantic and discreetly rigid, like a suitcase. I packed it with blocks of cheese, loaves of bread, and lots of soy products, because I was a vegetarian. \n \n But it wasn’t just about the supermarket—the whole world was one giant heist. It goes without saying that I used magnets to reset the Kinko’s copy counters to zero, and carried scissors to cut alarm tags out of clothes. Everyone I knew did these things. I say this not to excuse myself but just so you can visualize a legion of energetic, intelligent young lady criminals. Anytime anyone we knew flew into Portland, we urged her to buy luggage insurance and allow us to steal her bag from the baggage carrousel. The visiting friend then had to perform the role of the frantic claims reporter and was given a cut of the insurance money. Some friends were up for this; others thought it was an inhospitable thing to ask. \n \n My first employer in Portland was Goodwill, which, yes, is a charitable organization, and, no, I did not have any qualms about slipping books and clothes and knickknacks into my bag. Because what is money, anyway? It’s just a concept some asshole made up. I also put red “Sold” tags on large appliances and entire living-room sets, and felt magnanimous as my friends gleefully loaded up their vans. One day, a co-worker was admiring a pink blouse that had just come in. I encouraged her to take it, and when she wouldn’t I put the blouse in a Goodwill bag and ran out of the store calling, “Sir! Sir! You forgot your bag!” Then I stuffed it in the bushes. At closing time, I fished it out with a halfhearted “What’s this?” and handed it to my prim co-worker. Prim and ungrateful, as it turned out. I was called into the boss’s office the next morning; the pink shirt was on her desk. “The good news is we’re not going to press charges,” she said. I wept as I walked over the river to the place where my girlfriend worked as a dog groomer. I’d never been fired before. It was a lot like dropping out of school or being arrested. All of these institutions, in their crude, clumsy way, seemed to be saying, You don’t need us, we’ll never understand you, and it’s important for you not to want us to. \n \n I took the message to heart. I labored obsessively over creative pursuits they would never recognize, hurtling through systems and hierarchies as if nothing that already existed were relevant to me. I performed at colleges and scanned the room for what I could take. Even a box of chalk slipped into my pocket reassured me that I still had my freedom—the freedom to steal, to self-destruct, to ruin everything. \n \n There was an exact moment when I decided to quit. I was sitting on a man’s lap and we had just determined that I was “his girl.” As we kissed, I thought, Well, I guess I have to stop stealing now. As if the idea of having a boyfriend, of being straight, required straightening out in other ways. I may have been looking for an excuse; I may have realized that I didn’t need to be a criminal to be an artist. Art itself could be the crime—could be scary and dangerous enough to shoulder my rebellion. After a while, I also stopped getting into physical fights, working in peepshows, bleaching my hair white, and wearing my tights over my shoes. Still, for a long time I thought my biggest heist was fooling everyone into believing that I was an upstanding citizen, a sweet girl. Then, just a few years ago, I realized that everyone feels secretly fraudulent. It’s the feeling of being an adult. ♦', 'Lion’s Gate wild animal sanctuary has euthanized all 11 of its animals, its hand forced when the Elbert County commissioners denied the refuge’s request to move, co-owner Joan Laub said. \n \n Laub told KMGH-Channel 7 that the animals had to be euthanized because recurring flooding on the property made conditions unsafe. \n \n The sanctuary euthanized three lions, three tigers and five bears on April 20, according to KUSA-Channel 9. \n \n On April 12, Elbert County commissioners unanimously voted to deny the sanctuary’s request to move from eastern Elbert County to a location near Elizabeth, the Denver Post reported. \n \n Commissioner Grant Thayer said the unanimous vote to deny the sanctuary a special-use permit was made because “it was felt that the community impact would be best served if it was denied.” \n \n It was the second time the board of commissioners voted against a move for the facility, with a previous board turning down a similar request by Lion’s Gate in 2006. \n \n For years, neighbors living near the proposed relocation site had said it was not appropriate for a rural neighborhood mostly known for an equine lifestyle. They worried about safety and complained about the possibility of lions roaring at all times of day and night. \n \n Lion’s Gate owners, Laub and Peter Winney, argued at a planning commission meeting in March that the animals were elderly and posed little security risk. As for noise, Laub said the sanctuary’s two male lions might roar once a day for only seconds at a time. \n \n The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department told Denver7 officials were aware of the mass euthanasia and the burial of all 11 animals on the sanctuary grounds. But it said no regulations were violated. \n \n Pat Craig, the founder and executive director of the Wildlife Sanctuary in Keenesburg, which is the state’s largest with 450 animals, told Denver7 he was surprised the sanctuary’s owners didn’t try to find new homes for the animals. \n \n “In this specific case with Lion’s Gate, they have so few animals, they would easily be able to place every animal with another wildlife sanctuary,” Craig said.” “I can guarantee you that a lot of organizations would be glad to help.”']",2,"– Despite their fame and (sometimes) fortune, even celebrities occasionally turn to crime.

""That is why we have finished it a day ahead of time."" \n \n Batts said police would keep probing at the direction of the state\'s attorney, while Mosby stressed that her office is doing its own investigation. \n \n ""We are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified. We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system,"" her statement said. \n \n Batts left it to Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis to release yet another official timeline of what happened to Gray after his arrest nearly three weeks ago. \n \n In all, the previously undisclosed stop now makes four stops between the time officers arrested Gray and his arrival at a police station, where he was found unresponsive. He was hospitalized in critical condition and died a week later. \n \n Batts and Davis said nothing more about when or how investigators obtained the previously undisclosed video or learned about the additional stop. However, five of the six officers gave statements to investigators the day Gray was injured, and as recently as a week ago, the stop was not part of the official timeline, suggesting investigators learned of it later. \n \n Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with an officer and ran. Officers chased him down and handcuffed him behind his back. Bystander videos recorded police loading him, dragging his legs, into one of two metal compartments in the back of the van. \n \n Police earlier said the van stopped once so that officers could put Gray in ""leg irons"" because he had become ""irate;"" stopped again because the driver asked for an additional unit to check on Gray\'s condition, and then again to put an additional prisoner in the van\'s other compartment before arriving at the station. \n \n Now police are saying an additional stop was made before the driver asked officers to check on his condition. They said nothing about this stop other than its location — at what appears to be a desolate intersection with three vacant lots and a corner store. Last week, Batts had said the second prisoner told investigators the driver did not speed, make sudden stops or ""drive erratically"" during the trip, and that Gray was ""was still moving around, that he was kicking and making noises"" up until the van arrived at the police station. \n \n Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake sought to dispel any notion that the police report would bring a swift and public conclusion to the case. ""Whatever time the state\'s attorney\'s office needs to make that determination, the family wants to get it right,"" she said Wednesday after meeting with Gray\'s family and legal team. \n \n ""This family wants justice and they want justice that comes at the right time and not too soon,"" said Hassan Murphy, one of the family\'s lawyers. \n \n Meanwhile, protests over Gray\'s death spread Wednesday night to other cities including Boston, New York and Washington, making it clear that tensions over the case are far from subsiding. The demonstrations were mostly peaceful, but police made many arrests, including at least 60 in New York. \n \n Gray\'s death was only the latest high-profile case of a black man dying as the result of a police encounter. Similar protests erupted over the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York last year, and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Scott was shot in the back by a white officer who has since been charged with murder. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Ben Nuckols, Juliet Linderman, Matthew Barakat, Tom Foreman Jr., Jessica Gresko, Brian Witte and Jeff Horwitz contributed to this report.', 'Baltimore police have found that Freddie Gray suffered a serious head injury inside a prisoner transport wagon, with one wound indicating that he struck a protruding bolt in the back of the vehicle, according to sources familiar with the probe. \n \n New details of the investigation emerged as police officially turned over the case to city prosecutors Thursday. Police said they have ""exhausted every lead."" \n \n In announcing an early conclusion to the first phase of their investigation, police also revealed a previously unknown stop by the transport van driver. Officials declined to comment further on what happened but said they had obtained private security footage depicting that event. \n \n While witnesses have said that police officers roughly handled Gray, who died a week after his arrest from injuries including a severed spine, police have said a focus of their investigation has been what occurred in the van. \n \n Police also have acknowledged that officers violated protocol by not buckling in Gray and providing medical help when he asked for it. \n \n The van made several stops before arriving at the Western District police station, where Gray was found unresponsive and taken to the hospital. At one stop, the van picked up another prisoner, who was taken to the station on the other side of a metal partition. \n \n CR Market surveillance video provided police with a missing piece of the Freddie Gray wagon ride.

Batts noted that the investigation\'s first phase wrapped up a day before his self-imposed deadline of May 1, which he said demonstrated the agency\'s sense of urgency around the case. \n \n ""I understand the frustration, I understand the sense of urgency, and so has the organization, and that is why we finished a day ahead of time,"" Batts said. ""I also know that getting to the right answer is more important than speed."" \n \n Police did not make all of its investigative findings public. \n \n State\'s Attorney Marilyn Mosby will ultimately determine whether to bring charges against any of the six officers involved in Gray\'s arrest, and she has not set a timetable for that decision.

Written by Universal Pictures"", ""POPULAR \n \n First off, I love Jim Carrey. When producer Matthew Vaughn and director Jeff Wadlow called me up and suggested we do a conference call with him to talk about the sequel to the 2010 original I was genuinely excited. Like you, I love Eternal Sunshine, Man on the Moon and The Truman Show. Carrey is an actor like no other, an unpredictable force of nature who brings a layered warmth and humanity to his work as well as that unstoppable energy he's always been renowned for. He had lunch with Matthew around the time of the first movie and dug it so much he appeared that night on Conan O'Brien DRESSED as Kick-Ass, singing a duet with Conan dressed as Superman. Vaughn and I made a mental note to work with this guy as soon as possible as we're both huge admirers. \n \n Cut to almost three years later and I'm sitting in a screening room in London watching what I think is one of Carrey's best-ever performances. I'd seen Kick-Ass 2 in many forms, but this was the absolute final cut complete with opening titles, music and a terrific post-credit sequence you're all going to love. I couldn't be happier with this picture. It's as good as the original and in many ways BIGGER as it expands upon the universe and really takes things to the next level. There are a lot of stand-outs in the sequel, every actor really firing on full cylinders and an amazing script that moves like a rocket. But Carrey in particular is magnificent. He's never done anything like this before and even from the trailer, with his masked dog sidekick specially trained to munch criminal balls, you can see that something really fun and special is happening here. Colonel Stars and Stripes is so charismatic and all his scenes are up there with Nic Cage's amazing turn as Big Daddy in the original... which made it all the more surprising when Jim announced tonight that the gun-violence in Kick-Ass 2 has made him withdraw his support from the picture. \n \n As you may know, Jim is a passionate advocate of gun-control and I respect both his politics and his opinion, but I'm baffled by this sudden announcement as nothing seen in this picture wasn't in the screenplay eighteen months ago. Yes, the body-count is very high, but a movie called Kick-Ass 2 really has to do what it says on the tin. A sequel to the picture that gave us HIT-GIRL was always going to have some blood on the floor and this should have been no shock to a guy who enjoyed the first movie so much. My books are very hardcore, but the movies are adapted for a more mainstream audience and if you loved the tone of the first picture you're going to eat this up with a big, giant spoon. Like Jim, I'm horrified by real-life violence (even though I'm Scottish), but Kick-Ass 2 isn't a documentary. No actors were harmed in the making of this production! This is fiction and like Tarantino and Peckinpah, Scorcese and Eastwood, John Boorman, Oliver Stone and Chan-Wook Park, Kick-Ass avoids the usual bloodless body-count of most big summer pictures and focuses instead of the CONSEQUENCES of violence, whether it's the ramifications for friends and family or, as we saw in the first movie, Kick-Ass spending six months in hospital after his first street altercation. Ironically, Jim's character in Kick-Ass 2 is a Born-Again Christian and the big deal we made of the fact that he refuses to fire a gun is something he told us attracted him to the role in the first place. \n \n Ultimately, this is his decision, but I've never quite bought the notion that violence in fiction leads to violence in real-life any more than Harry Potter casting a spell creates more Boy Wizards in real-life. Our job as storytellers is to entertain and our toolbox can't be sabotaged by curtailing the use of guns in an action-movie. Imagine a John Wayne picture where he wasn't packing or a Rocky movie where Stallone wasn't punching someone repeatedly in the face. Our audience is smart enough to know they're all pretending and we should instead just sit back and enjoy the serotonin release of seeing bad guys meeting bad ends as much as we enjoyed seeing the Death Star exploding. The action in Kick-Ass 2 is like nothing you've ever seen before. The humour, the characters, the heart and the set-pieces are all things we're very proud of and the only warning I'd really include is that it's almost TOO EXCITING. Kick-Ass 2 is fictional fun so let's focus our ire instead of the real-life violence going on in the world like the war in Afghanistan, the alarming tension in Syria right now and the fact that Superman just snapped a guy's fucking neck. \n \n Jim, I love ya and I hope you reconsider for all the above points. You're amazing in this insanely fun picture and I'm very proud of what Jeff, Matthew and all the team have done here. \n \n Love and Peace, \n \n Mark Millar \n \n @mrmarkmillar \n \n PS For anyone wondering what all the fuss is about, the movie is based on the content of two books, which can be ordered below. \n \n Hit-Girl: \n \n http://www.amazon.co...it-girl prelude \n \n And Kick-Ass 2: \n \n http://www.amazon.co...pd_bxgy_b_img_y"", 'Jim Carrey has distanced himself from the upcoming Universal release ""Kick-Ass 2"" because of its violent content.

63,"['Mirror, Mirror \n \n (out of 4) \n \n Starring Julia Roberts, Lily Collins, Armie Hammer and Nathan Lane. Directed by Tarsem Singh. 106 minutes. Opens March 30 at major theatres. PG \n \n The first volley in the froth-vs.-goth wars between two film versions of the Snow White fairytale has been fired with Mirror, Mirror. \n \n It opens Friday, two months ahead of the June 1 bow for the more sinister-looking Snow White and the Huntsman. \n \n Mirror, Mirror takes itself less seriously, presenting a pink confection of slapstick laughs and swashbuckling heroics that references the classic Disney cartoon liberally, with sly winks to the genre — right down to cliché teeth twinkles. \n \n The story gets a 2012 girl-power update: no more waiting for a prince to save the day. Women don’t escape the fairytale slap-down entirely, however; the villain is still a vain old gal who can’t deal with all of her stepdaughter’s fabulousness. But this Snow White will see to her own destiny. \n \n Director Tarsem Singh certainly knows his way around fantasy filmmaking (Immortals, The Fall) but can he also bring a light touch to the dramatics? It’s a legitimate question in the face of the horribly overwrought Immortals. Turns out he can, although don’t look for much more than that. This rambling version of Snow White’s tale is a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-coloured macarons and similarly devoid of substance. \n \n Everything about Mirror, Mirror echoes old-school animation and the entire thing is gorgeous, from the high-concept snow-covered forest to a human form of a game of Battleship, where three-masted vessels nestle atop players’ heads like fanciful hats. \n \n This is the last film for Oscar-winning (Dracula) Japanese costume designer Eiko Ishioka, who died in January. She and Singh teamed earlier on Immortals, The Fall and The Cell, and it’s fitting that the film is dedicated to her, given the lift her work gives Mirror, Mirror. The elaborate costumes are stunning, especially the fanciful animal-themed masked ball outfits with over-the-top headdresses. \n \n Julia Roberts stars as The Queen, nasty stepmother to Snow White (Lily Collins and her massive eyebrows), sliding from America’s sweetheart to icily evil beauty with ease. Easily bored and self-absorbed, the years are piling up and Queenie is hardly happy about it, using a magical mirror with a surprising inhabitant to keep herself looking fresh. \n \n The Queen’s devoted servant Brighton (Nathan Lane doing a fantastic Nathan Lane) simpers and cowers as he reluctantly does all her bidding. There’s no retirement plan for toadies in this kingdom. \n \n Snow spends most of her time locked up in her bedroom, missing her father, the King, who disappeared in the woods where he was likely devoured by the beast who lives there. Now 18, she’d like to get out of her room occasionally, but The Queen has other plans for her. \n \n The arrival of a handsome prince (Armie Hammer as Prince Alcott) stirs the pot. He’s buff and a bit of a buffoon, but the Queen sees a chance to help the kingdom she’s bankrupted with her party excesses by marrying him. Too bad he only has eyes for Show White, a wrinkle the Queen deals with by ordering Brighton to drop her rival off in the dark woods to be part of the beast’s buffet. \n \n Jason Keller, whose last screenplay was for the ham-fisted Machine Gun Preacher, delivers whimsy by the bucket here, teaming the abandoned Snow up with seven rebel forest dwellers who don’t take well to being called dwarves. Onetime model citizens and business owners banished to the woods by the Queen for looking “different,” they’ve found amusing means to measure up and prefer to make money the Robin Hood way rather than by toiling in a mine. \n \n Among them, we meet Grub (Joe Gnoffo), who loves food, perpetually lovesick Half Pint (Mark Povinelli) and writer Grimm (Danny Woodburn). London, Ont., actor Jordan Prentice plays Napoleon, the de facto leader of the group without a short man syndrome. \n \n Collins, daughter of musician Phil, does well in her first big leading role as a lively Snow, showing a good comic sensibility. But those Groucho Marx eyebrows are a constant distraction. \n \n From the CGI-created castle to the Bollywood-inspired final dance number, Mirror, Mirror is aimed straight at the eyeballs. But it bypasses the heart in the process.', 'Who’s the Most Self-Absorbed of Them All? ‘Mirror Mirror,’ Tarsem Singh’s Snow White Story \n \n Is it possible for filmmakers to still peddle the old “once upon a time” in the age of Katniss Everdeen, the ferocious teenage warrior from “The Hunger Games”? The answer, from the evidence of Tarsem Singh’s “Mirror Mirror,” a would-be comic and cheeky redo of Snow White, is yes, but not persuasively. The princess (Lily Collins) here smiles obligingly while flouncing about in a gown, but she also helps write her own happily ever after with a sword. Whether that makes her a feminist heroine or just another self-actualized Disneyesque waif may depend on your idea of empowerment. (In June the fairy tale gets another makeover in “Snow White and the Huntsman.” ) \n \n Written by, among others, the Brothers Grimm and waggishly retrofitted for “Mirror Mirror” by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, the essential story is as you probably remember it, only with jokes: a widower King remarries, giving the realm a new Queen (Julia Roberts, seemingly very self-amused), and his only child, Snow White, a mother. But when the King disappears, a turn that’s represented in the film by a striking animated sequence, Snow White falls into the grasping hands of the Queen, who turns out to be a pathological narcissist suffering from possible delusions. (She talks to her mirror.) You know the rest — seven dwarfs, a prince, a girl’s youth, a woman’s vanity — all familiar pieces that are both this movie’s strength and its gravest flaws. \n \n Mr. Singh started out directing music videos. The short form suits him. “Mirror Mirror” runs a long 95 minutes, but it’s a virtual breeze when compared with his previous movie, “Immortals,” a camp farrago set in ancient Greece (by way of a Vegas floor show), that runs an enervating 110 minutes. Critics like to take note of Mr. Singh’s eye-catching visuals, and there’s no doubt he knows how to swank up performers and sets or rather hire talented professionals to do the job for him. The costumes in “Mirror Mirror” — by turns ethereal as a dream and as ponderous as sculptured marble — were created by Mr. Singh’s regular collaborator, the Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka. (Ms. Ishioka, who also designed the costumes for Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dracula,” died in January.) \n \n Yet while Mr. Singh knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play, which effectively means that he’s a better window dresser than a movie director. “Mirror Mirror” is consistently watchable, even when it drifts into dullness because Mr. Singh always gives you something to look at, whether it’s the Queen’s blood-red gown, the sailing clouds decorating her bedroom or the dwarfs’ woodland home. Everything looks as if it has been meticulously selected for this or that spot, including the performers. Ms. Roberts, Ms. Collins and Armie Hammer, as Prince Alcott, look as pretty as fairy-book illustrations, but their performances are similarly one dimensional, as if they had been art directed into place instead of cut loose. \n \n The only lead performer to wiggle free of Mr. Singh’s heavy hand is Nathan Lane, who plays the Queen’s henchman, Brighton, and whose amusingly tremulous, cagey performance owes much to Bob Hope. Mr. Lane is the only performer who sounds comfortable delivering Mr. Klein and Mr. Keller’s often intentionally anachronistic dialogue, which, with its forced lightness and scattershot jokes, makes an awkward fit with Mr. Singh’s lugubriousness. All of the scripted yuks register as an attempt to modernize the movie, as does affording Snow the chance to play a role in her own rescue, mostly by giving her a sword and putting her in palazzo pants. That’s nice, even if in the end it comes down to the same old story of love, glory and the devastating cost of female wrinkles. \n \n “Mirror Mirror” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Slapstick violence. \n \n Mirror Mirror \n \n Opens on Friday nationwide. \n \n Directed by Tarsem Singh; written by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, based on a story by Melisa Wallack; director of photography, Brendan Galvin; edited by Robert Duffy and Nick Moore; music by Alan Menken; choreography by Paul Becker; production design by Tom Foden; costumes by Eiko Ishioka; produced by Bernie Goldmann, Ryan Kavanaugh and Brett Ratner; released by Relativity Media.

There\'s no such downtime for the princess in the snappy retelling ""Mirror Mirror,"" a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between Disney and Grimm.A booster shot of testosterone lends kinetic kick to director Tarsem Singh \'s visually inventive interpretation, without shortchanging the requisite froufrou or sugarcoating the story\'s dark Oedipal heart. The mash-up can be choppy, but the fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast, led by a royally wicked Julia Roberts The screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller (a screen story credit goes to Melisa Wallack) pointedly rewrites the fairy-tale convention that finds every damsel helplessly imperiled until a prince delivers her from danger. This Snow White ( Lily Collins ) can get gussied up with the best of them, but she also holds her own in a fencing duel. And — hello, switcheroo — she rescues a prince in distress.When in exile, Snow (it\'s a first-name-informal kingdom) receives martial-arts instruction from the dwarfs. Like the famous septet from Disney\'s 1937 classic, this woods-dwelling crew provides collective-sidekick slapstick, and each has a character-defining shtick — most memorably the love-struck Half Pint (Mark Povinelli). But they\'ve also been restored to their folk tale roots as bandits and outcasts. They\'re action antiheroes with hearts of gold.Transforming Snow White to an action hero in her own right doesn\'t lessen the archetypal power of the stepmother-daughter, age-beauty conflict. Collins ( ""The Blind Side"" ) is a convincing foil for Roberts\' jealous Queen, personifying intelligence, innate goodness and fairest-of-them-all femininity. If a movie-star self-regard has crept into Roberts\' work over the years, here she uses it to winning effect, savoring the tension and silliness, and making an exceptionally entertaining evil monarch.Advised and chided by the alter ego who resides on the other side of her magic mirror — one of the film\'s more striking elements — the Queen sets her sights on an imperial merger with Prince Alcott ( Armie Hammer ), whose province\'s resources would save her from the brink of bankruptcy.Hammer, who brought an air of wounded regality to the Winklevoss twins in ""The Social Network"" and Clyde Tolson in ""J. Edgar,"" gets to shake off the aggrievement and let his princely flag fly, often without a shirt.Singh (a.k.a. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar or simply Tarsem) is a fantasist whose singular knack for spectacle can also be his weakness, set-piece razzle-dazzle not infrequently overwhelming the characters in his previous films: ""The Cell,"" ""The Fall"" and ""Immortals."" That weakness reveals itself in ""Mirror Mirror"" when he stops the story cold to indulge in a puppet sequence.But mostly the built-in structure of a well-known tale helps to rein him in, as does the propulsive rhythm of one-liners — some of the best are delivered with panache by Nathan Lane and Robert Emms, as mouthy servants. For most of its running time, the film strikes the right balance of make-believe enchantment and snark-infused lampoon, playing to older kids and adults alike.Crucial to the movie\'s magic are Tom Foden\'s lush and witty production design and the splendid costumes by Eiko Ishioka, the renowned designer\'s final screen work before her death in January. The finery and regalia of their contributions are integral to Singh\'s vision, giving this mostly conventional princess story its fair share of romantic froth and more than a little moxie.', 'Mirror Mirror \n \n March 28, 2012 \n \n Cast & Credits The Queen Julia Roberts \n \n Snow White Lily Collins \n \n Prince Alcott Armie Hammer \n \n Brighton Nathan Lane \n \n Napoleon Jordan Prentice \n \n Half Pint Mark Povinelli \n \n Grub Joe Gnoffo \n \n Grimm Danny Woodburn \n \n Wolf Sebastian Saraceno \n \n Butcher Martin Klebba \n \n Chuckles Ronald Lee Clark \n \n Charles Renbock Robert Emms \n \n Baker Margaret Mare Winningham \n \n Baron Michael Lerner \n \n King Sean Bean \n \n \n \n Relativity Media presents a film directed by Tarsem Singh.

Printer-friendly » \n \n E-mail this to a friend » \n \n ""Mirror Mirror"" is a sumptuous fantasy for the eyes and a pinball game for the mind, as story elements collide and roll around bumping into each other. This is not a faithful retelling of the versions by the Brothers Grimm or Walt Disney, but neither is it a satire, nor much of a story in its own right. But it\'s great to look at. If there\'s a major difference from the earlier versions, it\'s how this one has beefed-up roles for the seven dwarves, who here seem to be a merry band in search of Robin Hood. Nor do I recall earlier battles with a giant winged griffin. \n \n The look of the film owes everything to the director, Tarsem Singh, an India-born former TV commercial maker, famous for two of the best-looking movies I\'ve ever seen, ""The Cell"" (2000) and ""The Fall"" (2006). He\'s in love with spectacular landscapes and architecture, and in all of his films (including the underwhelming ""The Immortals"" in 2011) the costumes of the late Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka dominate every scene they\'re in and every character they\'re worn by. \n \n \n \n Julia Roberts seems particularly well-suited to wear them, and when first seen is wearing a magnificent orange gown and seated on a seashell throne which acts as a frame and a continuation of the costume. Roberts plays the Queen in a kingdom we\'re introduced to by her opening narration -- which uses animated dolls figures to fill us in on her early life, during which she was married to a King (Sean Bean) who promptly set off into the forest and was not seen again. That left her as the autocratic ruler of a kingdom with painfully high taxes, and the stepmother of Snow White (Lily Collins), who is a captive in the castle until she\'s 18. \n \n \n \n There is a financial crisis. Brighton (Nathan Lane), her aide and accountant, tells her she\'s broke. That comes at an inconvenient time, because Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) has wandered into the kingdom, and the Queen knows if she marries him, he can solve her finances. Problem is, she can\'t even afford the royal ball at which she plans for them to fall in love. \n \n \n \n The Prince has already met Snow White; they were both wandering in the woods when they encountered the seven dwarfs, jolly bandits with good hearts. It is Snow White and not the Prince in this version who bestows a life-changing kiss. It\'s almost uncanny in some scenes here, how Lily Collins (daughter of Phil Collins) looks like Audrey Hepburn. \n \n \n \n She\'s all sweet, all innocent, but Julia Roberts steals the show with her imperious and autocratic Queen. She consults her own image in a mirror, located as only Tarsem would place it in a weird structure in the middle of a lake. She never asks who is the fairest of them all, and thus never has to hear the inevitable answer, but the Queen\'s vanity and fear of aging give Roberts some plum scenes. Consider the one where she\'s having a spa-style beauty makeover before the ball. Her lips become bee-stung with the help of real bees, she gets a manicure from disgusting wormy creatures, and her skin is refreshed with a preparation made up from parrot droppings. Yes, parrot droppings, and we see the parrots dropping them. \n \n \n \n All of this is in place and looks great, but the dialogue is rather flat, the movie sort of boring, and there\'s not much energy in the two places it should really be felt: Between the Queen and Snow White, and between Snow and the Prince. The story is a listless tale that moves at a stately pace through settings that could have supported fireworks. Indeed, the characters who seem to care the most about each other are the dwarfs.']",4,"– The latest retelling of Snow White (before June's Snow White and the Huntsman) is a lot like its vain queen: visually stunning, but kind of shallow. Critics aren't particularly impressed with Mirror Mirror: Though director Tarsem Singh ""knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play,"" notes Manohla Dargis in the New York Times. That ""effectively means that he’s a better window dresser than a movie director."" In the Toronto Star, Linda Barnard agrees. ""Everything about Mirror Mirror echoes old-school animation and the entire thing is gorgeous,"" she notes. It's ""a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-colored macarons and similarly devoid of substance."" The script doesn't hold up to the visuals, writes Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. ""The dialogue is rather flat, the movie sort of boring,"" he notes. It's ""a listless tale that moves at a stately pace through settings that could have supported fireworks."" In the Los Angeles Times, however, Sheri Linden sees a lot to like. ""The fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast, led by a royally wicked Julia Roberts"" as the queen. It's ""a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between Disney and Grimm."""
64,"[""Sen. Ted Cruz (R) leads his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, by just 1 point in their Texas Senate race, well within the margin of error of a new poll from Emerson College. \n \n The survey, which was released on Monday, found that Cruz leads O'Rourke 38 to 37 percent. Four percent of voters favor a different candidate and 21 percent remain undecided. \n \n The survey comes as O'Rourke continues to gain momentum in his quest to unseat Cruz. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n While Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in three decades, polls continue to show that the race between O'Rourke and Cruz will be tight. Just last week, a new NBC News–Marist survey found that Cruz led O'Rourke by 4 points. \n \n In addition, the Cook Political Report shifted the race from its “likely Republican” column to “lean Republican” earlier this month. \n \n Emerson College notes that O'Rourke is a popular candidate, which could spell trouble for Cruz. According to the survey, the three-term congressman is viewed favorably by 37 percent of registered voters. \n \n O'Rourke leads Cruz among voters in the 18–34 and 35–54 age ranges. On the other hand, Cruz has the advantage among voters between 55 and 74 and over the age of 75. \n \n The Emerson College survey was conducted from Aug. 22 to 25 among a population of 550 voters.

Full transcript below clips of quotes. \n \n \n \n ""I think it\'s like a major story,"" Trump said about interim DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile\'s revelation that the DNC stacked the deck against Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary.

I want to tell you, that is a big story what you\'re saying. It\'s illegal, number one. And it\'s really unfair to Bernie Sanders. I\'m not a Bernie Sanders fan. Although I must say that I got a lot of his votes when he was thrown out. Many of those people voted for me because of trade, because I agreed with him on trade. We\'re just doing more about it than he can do and we\'re doing a lot about it. But I thought that was terrible."" \n \n \n \n Trump on dossier: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Hillary Clinton said last night that paying for the dossier – she defended it, basically. She said it’s different from meeting with Russians; like meeting with Russians. She’s trying to make a comparison to say – she totally defended it. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, she talked about oppo research is wonderful; oppo research – but not when it comes to us; okay? Oppo research for us, of course, is no good; no. \n \n \n \n That dossier which is totally fake and made up – it’s like a novel – but that dossier is a disgrace and it should not have been allowed to be used. And then I hear the kind of money they spent. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: $9 million. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: I mean, it’s inconceivable. It’s absolutely inconceivable – it’s horrible. \n \n INGRAHAM: The justice system a ""joke"" and a ""laughing stock,"" you said the other day.

This guy would be tied up forever in the court system. You look at some of the cases that are going on forever and you have them dead to rights? Now, the justice system has to go quicker and it has to be, really, stronger and fairer. Probably has to be fairer too. \n \n INGRAHAM: Will it be part of a Dreamer deal, a DACA deal? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Yes. It\'ll be part of a DACA deal. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: And if it... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: DACA\'s a lot different than Dreamer. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: That means for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals? Will -- will you require that, if any amnesty talks will -- will require chain migration to end? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: I don\'t think any Republican would vote for anything having to do with leaving chain migration. Chain migration is a disaster for this country and it\'s horrible. \n \n .@POTUS on the economy: ""The thing I\'m most proud about... companies are starting to come back into our country."" @IngrahamAngle pic.twitter.com/EESAOrU7k4 — Fox News (@FoxNews) November 3, 2017 \n \n INGRAHAM: Mr. President, it’s good to see you. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Thank you. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Today the tax plan announced. And it’s interesting – you’re getting hit from the left and some on the right. Rand Paul is going to vote for it, I think, but he said it’s not significant because the upper-income tier doesn’t get a lot of tax-rate relief, or any. And then Ron Wyden calls it basically a middle-class con job. It’s not really a tax cut for the middle class. So, left and right. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, they’re big tax cuts – the biggest cuts in the history of our country, actually. We have reform, we have simplification. \n \n \n \n And honestly, I’m surprised a little bit to hear what you’re saying because we’ve really gotten great reviews – people are loving it. Even a certain newspaper that I don’t like very much came out today and they gave Schumer four Pinocchios. And they said, because he was not telling the truth when it came to the middle class because he said it’s for the rich and it’s really not for the rich; it’s for the middle class and it’s for jobs. And I would say, maybe even in that order. \n \n \n \n So, the middle class is a big beneficiary. Jobs and companies are big beneficiaries – but the companies really create the jobs. And we really have, Laura, we’ve had tremendous receptivity to a point that I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like it. So, – and I do think Rand Paul, by the way, who I like, I think he’s going to vote for it. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Hillary Clinton said last night that paying for the dossier – she defended it, basically. She said it’s different from meeting with Russians; like meeting with Russians. She’s trying to make a comparison to say – she totally defended it. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, she talked about oppo research is wonderful; oppo research – but not when it comes to us; okay?

It’s absolutely inconceivable – it’s horrible. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Donna Brazile, in her new book, writes about the DNC, Democrat primary rigging and talks about corruption, internal corruption and unethical finances. And she tags Hillary Clinton. Are you surprised about this... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: I think it\'s... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: ... given what you said about Bernie Sanders, being -- being given the short shrift? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: I think it\'s an -- you know, like, it\'s a major story. Now I don\'t know if the mainstream fake media -- because they are fake and phony, but I just don\'t know if they\'re gonna pick it up. But I want to tell you, that is a big story, what she\'s (ph) saying. It\'s illegal, number one, and it\'s really very unfair to Bernie Sanders. \n \n \n \n I\'m not a Bernie Sanders fan, although I must say, I got a lot of his votes. When he was thrown out, many of those people voted for me because of trade. Because I agreed with him on (ph) trade. We\'re just doing more about it than he can do and we\'re doing a lot about it. But that was -- I thought that was terrible. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: The justice system a ""joke"" and a ""laughing stock,"" you said the other day. What were you referring to with that? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, when I look at immigration and I look at this whole thing, coming in by lottery and then we can’t\' do anything about it quickly, and I look at what\'s going on with justice when it comes to so many different topics, I really feel... \n \n \n \n (CROSSTALK) \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Criminal justice, you\'re talking about criminal justice issues? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: A lot of justice. This guy would be tied up forever in the court system. You look at some of the cases that are going on forever and you have them dead (ph) to (ph) right (ph)? Now, the justice system has to go quicker and it has to be, really, stronger and fairer. Probably has to be fairer too. \n \n \n \n But it\'s very sad. When you look at a lottery system and you have people coming into the country through the form of a lottery, and, you know, the country (ph) is (ph)... \n \n \n \n (CROSSTALK) \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Fifty thousand? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... just so you understand, the countries aren\'t putting their finest in there. They\'re not putting their best and their greatest and their finest in there. And this kid came in through a lottery system that\'s gonna end, and it\'s gonna end fast. In fact, I\'ve already instructed Congress. They must end it. And I think we\'re gonna get, even, Democrat support on this. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: You had a DACA talk today for the Dreamers... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: I did. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: ... your base and what you campaigned on was, real common-sense policies. You talked about e-verify, building the... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Right. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: ... wall, chain migration, which is a huge problem. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: All of those things are happening. Chain migration... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: And is that gonna be part of any DACA deal? So if the... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Yeah. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: ... Democrats want Dreamer help, they\'re gonna have to do... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Yeah, we\'re going... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: ... they\'re gonna have to do either (inaudible) by (ph) chain migration? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Sure, sure. Chain migration\'s one of the most important things. And most people, frankly... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Is that a requirement for you? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... until yesterday, most people had never heard of chain migration. I gave a form (ph) of a press conference and I started talking about chain migration. And this horrible animal -- he\'s an animal, as far as I\'m concerned -- 23 people have touched him, maybe came in because he was in. And he was only in with a green card, supposedly. \n \n \n \n But chain migration, where his whole family comes in, his mother can come in, his father, his grandmother. Everybody comes in. Chain migration is a disaster for this country and it\'s gonna end. Now, I\'ve been talking about it for a while but I think the public, until yesterday, probably never heard about chain migration. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Well, the Republicans didn\'t want to touch it for a long time. You\'ve -- you\'ve... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, they\'re touching it now... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: ... held up a mirror to what the Republicans weren\'t (ph) doing (ph), too. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... you know? They\'re touching it now. It\'s become a very, very strong point right now. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Will it be part of a Dreamer deal, a DAD deal? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Yes. It\'ll be part of a DACA deal. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: And if it... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: DACA\'s a lot different than Dreamer. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: That (ph) means (ph) for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Yeah. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Will -- will you require that, if any amnesty talks will -- will require chain migration to end? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: I don\'t think any Republican would vote for anything having to do with leaving chain migration. Chain migration is a disaster for this country and it\'s horrible. I mean, just take a look at him. Twenty-three people -- potentially, 23 people... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Is that verified? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: It\'s what I heard, it\'s what I gave. Whether it\'s 23 or whether it\'s two, as far as I\'m concerned, it\'s too (ph) much (ph), OK? \n \n \n \n (CROSSTALK) \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: It\'s a big difference, two or 23. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: No, no, I know that. But I hear it\'s 23. It\'s a lot of people. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: The wall. I mean, I was at rallies, that\'s what people -- they want that wall built. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, it\'s one of the things. But we\'re gonna have a wall... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: But -- but Paul Ryan said... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... and in fact, we (ph) just (ph)... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: ... 1.4 billion, he would -- he would start. Perhaps that number\'s been thrown out. But that\'s... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Phase one... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: ... that\'s a pittance. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... phase one, during the first -- well, first of all, they say the wall\'s gonna cost $40 billion. It\'s not gonna cost anywhere near that... \n \n \n \n (CROSSTALK) \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: But (ph) half (ph) that (ph)... \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... but the Democrats are saying. We\'re talking about less than half. Also, you don\'t have a wall -- you have 2,000 miles. You have mountains, you have rivers, you have things that you don\'t put the wall and (ph) and you don\'t need (inaudible) and never was planned for that. \n \n \n \n No (ph), I think for $18 billion or less, we\'re gonna have a great wall. We\'re doing prototypes right now. We\'re gonna make the choice. We have the people from Border Patrol and ICE working with us very closely because, ultimately, they\'re the ones that are gonna have to use it. \n \n \n \n One of the things that\'s come up pretty strongly is, we want to have vision (ph) through the wall because you want to see what\'s on the other side of the wall. You know, you think we\'re gonna build a nice, simple concrete wall but it\'s not that simple. No, we\'re having the wall. We have to have the wall. \n \n \n \n We need the wall for another reason, drugs. Drugs are pouring into our country. A lot of them are coming in through the southern border and the wall will be a tremendous tool to help facilitate the ending of the drugs coming in. No, the wall is actually coming along pretty well. That will also be a part of DADA or whatever. It... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: But a down payment, or a guaranteed funding (ph)? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: No. Well, look. When we get the down payment, we\'re gonna have a guarantee, believe me. We\'re not taking a down payment... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Yeah. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... and then say, where\'s the rest... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: But that\'s a -- that could be a scam as well. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... of the money? Because, you know, you don\'t spend all the money immediately... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Yeah. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: ... so we can put it back. But when we take a down payment, I\'m gonna say, ""I want to make sure the rest of the money is coming."" \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: You\'re heading off to Asia. Huge trip. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Yeah. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: A lot\'s (ph) at (ph) stake (ph). You (ph) got North Korea, a deal with the Chinese. You\'re gonna stop in Seoul. Your State Department still has some unfilled positions. I know I mentioned this before on -- on Fox. Your Asia desk is being run by a career diplomat. Not your person, not your vision. \n \n \n \n Are you worried that the State Department doesn\'t have enough Donald Trump nominees in there to push your vision through? Because other State Departments, including Reagan\'s, at this time, undermined his agenda. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Yeah (ph). \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: And there -- there\'s a concern that the State Department currently is undermining your agenda. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: So we don\'t need all the people that they want. You know, don\'t forget, I\'m a businessperson and I tell my people, ""When (ph) you don\'t need to fill slots, don\'t fill them."" But we have some people that I\'m not happy with there. (inaudible) processed (ph)... \n \n \n \n (CROSSTALK) \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: But Assistant Secretary of State, you\'re not getting rid of that position. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: All right. But let me tell you. The one that matters is me. I\'m the only one that matters because, when it comes to it, that\'s what the policy is going to be. You\'ve seen that, you\'ve seen it strongly. We\'re filling up roles. And, don\'t forget, Schumer and the Democrats are just obstructing. You can\'t get anything through. We have almost about half the number of people coming through as Obama had. They are obstructing. \n \n \n \n Now, what we’re doing – and the Senate has been so obstruct (ph). They\'re working much longer hours, we have to get our people in. But in addition to that, we don’t need all of the people, you know, it’s called cost saving – you know, in the old days... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: But you want your vision pushed. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: I want my vision, but my vision is my vision. Anyway, it’s called cost saving. There\'s nothing wrong with cost saving. Rex is in there working hard, he’s doing his best, he’s doing the best he can. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Is he going to be with you for the duration? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, we’ll see. I don’t know who’s going to be – duration, I think the duration – I\'ll tell you this. I don’t think any president in nine months has done the job that we’ve done, and that includes bills being passed by Congress. You look at what\'s passed by the senate, by the House, I think we’re close to 70 bills, maybe over 70 bills. It almost a record. You look at all of the deregulation, you look at Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch, you look at all of the other district judges – federal district judges and court of appeals judges, I don’t think – and then of course, take a look at the economy. Take a look. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Look at the economy. Look at the economy, are you getting the credit for this economic revival without tax cuts through – yeah, without Obamacare repeal yet, and this is a stunning economic revival in 10 months. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: One of the greatest in the history of our country, and I\'m in here now 10 months, and we are setting record after record, day after day. I think we hit another one today. No, I\'m not getting enough credit for it, because a lot of the reason is enthusiasm level, business level, and also the fact that I\'ve cut regulations to the extent that I\'ve cut them. I mean, I can tell you jobs that were never going to get built are now being built. Take a look at the pipelines – the Keystone Pipelines, the Dakota Access Pipelines... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Made a big announcement today too, another company coming back from Singapore. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: We have another one, that’s right. We have a big one, we have a Broadcom, which is one of the Fortune 100 companies. They are now leaving Asia and they\'re coming – they\'re moving back into the United States. No, I don’t get the credit, but you know, frankly, I think ultimately I will, because there\'s not much they can do about it. I mean, everyday we’re hitting new highs, very important GDP. You take a look, GDP, 3.2, and now 3, and last one was after four or five really, obviously possible hurricanes, and that’s the equivalent of a point, so that would have been a 4. \n \n \n \n A 4 was unthinkable, and each time we go up a point, that’s $2.5 trillion and thousands – I mean millions of jobs, actually. So look, the news is fake. I must say, Fox has treated me fairly, not necessarily well, but they’ve treated me very fairly. But so much of the news is fake. And you know, the other day, somebody said, what\'s the biggest surprise? I said, you know, after I thought after I won, the news would get fair, and actually, they got worse. They really are, whether its CNN or CBS or NBC or ABC, local news has been great. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Even Bryan Cranston, that actor who wasn’t a fan of yours, said, I want him to be successful. And he said to Hollywood celebrities who are not supporting you, shut the blank up, basically, which was nice to see. There are other images out there that aren’t nice to see, that are being put on album covers, put on magazines, late night TV. Hollywood depravity in our children, how big of a problem do you think it is? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, I think Hollywood depravity period is not only for children, for everything. I look at what\'s happening with that, and I look at what\'s happening with that, and frankly, if they said some of the things about Obama, you would have people – politically correct people say, you can\'t say that, but with me, it’s allowed. \n \n \n \n I think it’s disgraceful but we power forward and again, we have one of the great economies ever, and believe me, that’s because of our decisions. When you think about Keystone, that was dead. When you think about Dakota, that was 42,000 jobs right there, that was just one small thing they did right at the very beginning, and we’ve done many of them. And now, the things I\'m most proud about, companies are starting to come back into our country. They were leaving... \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Repatriating. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: They are coming back. And one of the things about our taxes – you talk about repatriation. We’re bringing in probably – I think the number is going to be over $4 trillion coming back into our country so it’s going to be put to work. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Speaking of, are you going to do China enforcement on this trip? Tell China intellectual property theft, subsidies, dumping in our country – \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Yeah. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Are you going to be tough on the enforcement side, given what they’re doing to this country? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: You have to understand something – very important. We have a problem called North Korea. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Are you going to tie (inaudible) with Korea? With South Korea’s trade deficit? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, we’re going to see. But we have one problem that’s a very big problem – it’s called North Korea. China has been helpful. We are talking trade with China, but I am also – \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: It sounds like it. Not just one thing. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: And President Xi has been pretty terrific. Most people have been saying whether it’s cutting the banking system off from North Korea, whether it’s cutting the oil down to North Korea, cutting supplies down. And I must tell you North Korea is a thing that I think we will solve and if we don’t solve it, it’s not going to be very pleasant for them. It’s not going to be very pleasant, I guess, for anybody; but China is helping us. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Japan is worried. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, of course they’re worried. They should be worried. You know, they’re very close to North Korea. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: And they want a nuclear pledge from the United States if they go after Japan. \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, you know Japan is a warrior nation. And I tell China and I tell everyone else that, listen, you’re going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: Are we going to make any pledges to Japan to defend them in a nuclear capacity? \n \n \n \n TRUMP: Well, look, they’re an ally – they’re an ally. The Prime Minister is a very good friend of mine. Prime Minister Abe – I’ve become very close. I’ve become very, very, close to President Xi of China. I think a lot of good things are going to happen. I think it’s a very important trip. I think this is one of the more important trips that a president has made. \n \n \n \n INGRAHAM: You don’t like traveling, though.

Cruz, of course, is the Republican incumbent hoping to keep his Senate seat, while O'Rourke is a 45-year-old three-term congressman mounting a surprisingly strong challenge. A new poll by Emerson College out this week has the race in a statistical dead heat, reports the Hill, which notes that Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in three decades. Here's a look at the latest, including O'Rourke's growing national profile: Rock star: The Texas GOP tweeted an old photo of O'Rourke this week showing him back in the '90s with his old punk band, Foss. The photo was meant to mock O'Rourke, and some Republicans think it did just that. ""Wearing a dress?"" tweeted one strategist. But an analysis at the Washington Post thinks the photo actually endeared O'Rourke to far more people than it alienated. His ""rock-star status is cemented by Texas GOP, handing Dems an icon they desperately need,"" reads the headline. Oh, he skateboards, too."

And it’s not in TV. Gasp! A “real” job? Surely not! \n \n But yes: According to E!, Access Hollywood, the Daily Mail, and pretty much every other entertainment news source out there, the former Kate Plus 8 star has gotten a job, and guess what? She’s a blogger now! Kate has signed on to write for the website CouponCabin.com. In her weekly features, she’ll be offering money-saving advice on such topics as stretching budgets for large family, holiday shopping, gift ideas, and more. Said Kate in CouponCabin’s official release, “No matter what your financial situation is, there’s no reason not to use coupons. It’s like free money in your pocket!” \n \n Kate’s first post will appear on November 22, two days before Thanksgiving. The topic? How to handle Black Friday, of course. As fellow bloggers, we here at BettyConfidential welcome you to the ranks, Kate. Do us proud. \n \n Read ‘Twilight’ Stars to Be Immortalized at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre TODAY! \n \n You know, it’s nice to see that Kate has finally moved on from that whole “NO! I MUST STAY IN TV NO MATTER WHAT!” state of mind. Finding a job in this economy isn’t easy, and odds are, you’re going to end up doing something you hadn’t thought you’d be doing, simply because it’s what will pay the bills. Believe me. I’ve been there. Unemployment is a bitch, and it’s not necessarily your “fault” that it’s where you’re at. But flexibility of thinking is a good skill to have no matter what, and it’s good to know that she’s starting to exercise it. And hey, she can still capitalize off of her reality fame in her new line of work, right? \n \n She might even be able to use her new gig to springboard back into television. I hear Extreme Couponing is pretty hot these days. Maybe they could use her couponing expertise? \n \n Lucia Peters is BettyConfidential’s associate editor.', 'Kate Gosselin: coupon expert. (Andy Kropa - GETTY IMAGES) \n \n When Kate Gosselin’s reality show “Kate Plus 8” got canceled in August, many of you were concerned about her potential employment options. \n \n All right, fine. You weren’t really that concerned. You were actually overjoyed. \n \n Still, Gosselin is a mom, like many of us, and she needs to support her kids. Which is why I am happy to find out that she has a new job: She is now a coupon blogger for the Web site CouponCabin.com. \n \n CouponCabin.com announced the news in a press release that conveyed the Web site’s excitement over its new hire, who is “a longtime advocate of couponing.” \n \n “Kate has embraced coupons her entire life,” said Jackie Warrick, president at CouponCabin.com, according to the press release. “We look forward to sharing the unique insight she has gained over the years.” \n \n Added Gosselin: “No matter what your financial situation is, there’s no reason not to use coupons. It’s like free money in your pocket!” \n \n The former reality star will begin her new job officially on Nov. 22, at which time she will blog about how to navigate Black Friday. Future topics, according to the press release, include how to stretch a budget for a large family and holiday shopping tips. \n \n Chuckle heartily over this tidbit all you like, but I genuinely think this is great news for three reasons. \n \n 1. It keeps Gosselin’s kids off of television . . . at least for now. \n \n As previously noted, a mom’s got to eat and she needs to make sure her children do, too. If she can do that by writing about the best way to save cash on detergent or action figures, what’s the harm? Of course, the CouponCabin.com blogging gig may not be enough to pay the bills. I mean, we can’t all engage in the mindblowingly lucrative work of blogging about celebrities and pop culture. (I just typed that sentence while gazing at my diamond-encrusted fingernails as they tappa-tapped on my keyboard, which is made out of genuine leather and features function keys ensconced in imported silk.) But even if this keeps her busy and semi-compensated for a while — and less focused on the new TV deal she said she wants earlier this week on “The View” — this is a good thing. \n \n 2. Her blog entries may provide fodder for Celebritology blog entries that compare Gosselin’s shopping tips to Gwyneth Paltrow’s shopping tips from Goop. \n \n And the comments on those Celebritology posts will be so rich with gleeful sarcasm that they may incite a phenomenon scientists have long predicted: the Big Snark Bang. Sure, both the blogosphere and the universe may immediately combust as a result. But it will be worth it. \n \n 3. As a result of Gosselin’s new job, CouponCabin.com just got a lot more publicity. \n \n And that’s super-exciting because, as Gosselin noted in the aforementioned press release, CouponCabin.com is the place where you can easily find the best deals on practically everything. \n \n And there are two things we all need more of in these challenging times: great deals on practically everything and Kate Gosselin.', 'Kate Gosselin can ease up on the ""freaking out"": The out-of-work reality star has a job now -- a part-time gig, at least. \n \n Gosselin, whose ""Kate Plus 8"" reality show took its last breath in September, will be a contributing blogger for click-and-save website Coupon Cabin. \n \n ""I\'ve never quit a job in my life without having something else lined up,"" she told People at the time.

67,"['JAMESTOWN, Tuolumne County (KPIX 5) — Weeks of rainy weather across Northern California and the storm runoff through the hills of gold country have triggered a new gold rush. \n \n “Miner Gary” Thomas said he always finds at least a little gold here on his property near Jamestown in Tuolumne County, but this year, there’s so much more runoff than normal and it’s shaking the gold from these hills. \n \n Thomas said it could provide a “Eureka” moment for those inclined to come up here and look for it. “(The runoff) kind of ‘etch-a-sketches’ everything,” said Thomas. “Eveything I had dug up and now my dig spots are all gone.” \n \n The known gold digs were washed out, trees uprooted, and landscape eroded. The runoffs have also removed gold out of the old abandoned mines and sent it down the river. \n \n “It’s going to bring down more gold,” said Thomas. “It’s going to bring up new areas that I never got to.” \n \n Thomas runs tour groups through his property and said now is the optimum time for gold hunting because the storms have just finished churning the landscape. \n \n Officials from the Bureau of Land Management say the erosion “concentrates” the gold by removing the lighter rock and soil. \n \n You may be wondering if this reporter found any during our time here. We did find some fine flakes of what they call “flour gold” and it was found more quickly than normal in just a couple of panning sessions. \n \n “Eureka!” said Thomas.”That’s hard to do.” \n \n But not as hard this year, now that Mother Nature has shaken up the motherlode. \n \n Thomas said one hot spot this year will be below the Oroville Dam, because the huge water releases from the spillway could reveal some new pockets of gold.', 'Joey Wilson, left, rings up Curtis Barwick for a gold pan and a portable slough Saturday at Adventures in Prospecting in downtown Oroville. Dan Reidel — Enterprise-Record \n \n Oroville >> Now is not the time to quit your day job in hopes of striking it rich. However, people with a new or renewed interest in gold mining may be spending more of their summer weekends near rivers and streams. \n \n Joey Wilson owns Adventures in Prospecting in Oroville, where he says there’s been more excitement among his gold mining customers. \n \n “There’s always been gold in the Feather River,” he said. What’s new is that the recent floods have moved things around. \n \n It’s not just the Feather River. Floods scoured the banks of the American River, the Mokelumne, the Yuba and just about any other waterway where 49ers once got their boots dirty. \n \n Curtis Barwick was in Oroville Saturday waiting for the prospecting store to open. He usually looks for gold closer to his home in Anderson, but decided to check out Oroville on his day off. He said gold mining gets him outdoors and helps him “recharge,” after a stressful week at work. It’s a lot like hiking, another of his hobbies, but with gold mining there’s a chance of a reward. \n \n “The odds are greater than winning the lottery,” he said. Even on days when he only finds a few flakes, it’s fun to turn over rocks and sand. \n \n He’s not alone. In fact, he’s a member of the Shasta Miners and Prospectors Association. \n \n Back in the day, miners in the 1850s did not have metal detectors. Barwick bought one a while back and said if “lead was gold, I’d be rich.” He had found more bullet casings than he cares to collect. Other finds include coins, and a 1944 nickel. He gave his girlfriend a ring he found in the dirt, and would recommend that anyone who buys a metal detector have some fun digging around in their own backyard. \n \n Others make gold mining an adventure. That’s one of the reasons Wilson named his shop “Adventures in Prospecting.” He sells wet suits and fins, and personally loves to dive when he hunts gold. \n \n Finding gold is a common thread for Cindy and Paul Pekarek, who were at the Montgomery Street miner’s supply shop Saturday. The couple belong to the Mother Lode Goldhounds, near Grass Valley, and for fun they travel to new digs, including Oroville. \n \n Paul Pekarek is a five-time gold mining champion, he said pointing to a pin on his wide-brimmed, black leather hat. The pin includes a miniature gold pan, pickaxe and shovel, with a real glob of gold in the center. To win the championships, he proved he could pan faster than most others. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Some people, like Mark Saposnik, are “pretty serious” about gold mining. Saposnik spent his summers during college dredge mining. It’s more difficult to find gold now that dredging is no longer allowed, he said. The recent floods have “rearranged the rivers,” he said, and he’ll spend more time stomping around. \n \n Spillway gold? \n \n Gold miners can speculate all they want about gold that may or may not have washed down the hillside near the Oroville spillway. Before hydraulic mining was outlawed, hillsides up and down the river were washed away to unearth gold. \n \n Gold is heavy, and prospectors would love to discover what is among the debris at the Diversion Pool. However, the area is closed except for the work crew. \n \n Recent word from Department of Water Resources acting director Bill Croyle was that he did not know if gold had been found in the area. \n \n It’s a moot point because “if anybody gets close to it they will be run off,” said Bob Van Camp, known locally as “Digger Bob.” \n \n Van Camp was the spokesman in 2014 when a 5.18 pound gold nugget was found in the Butte foothills. The man who found the nugget has remained anonymous, but Van Camp was allowed to tell the story. \n \n As for the spillway debris, Van Camp said he believes there is a gold vein that runs from Potter’s Ravine and south, including the area of the spillway. \n \n In addition to panning near waterways, prospectors look for quartz, especially chunks that have been worn smooth by water flow. “Then you go downstream.” \n \n He’ll also walk the higher ground with a metal detector, hoping some of that quartz will give him a strong signal. \n \n Ninety-nine percent of the time the quartz is just quartz, but “now and again,” the quartz will have “some sort of metal in it.” This might mean manganese or silver, “or there may be gold inside.” \n \n Part of the fun in finding gold is knowing it’s something that an old-time gold miner missed, Van Camp said. “I don’t do it for the money. I just do it for the adventure, for the challenge.” \n \n He would love to get his hands dirty in the Diversion Pool at Lake Oroville right now. However, he understands that DWR is working night and day to get the water flow back to normal. \n \n People will be looking at other areas, where gold panning is allowed. After the floods of the mid 1990s, “it was good getting for those of us who knew how to look,” he said. \n \n For an amateur, the adventure could lead to frustration. “But I don’t want to discourage people from learning about history, getting some fresh air and enjoying themselves, even if they don’t find anything.” \n \n Right now, the water is still high. When dry times arrive, more streambed will be exposed, he said. \n \n “I’m going to have a ball this summer.” \n \n Know the rules \n \n The rules have changed for gold miners. Suction dredge equipment is no longer allowed, which includes “mechanized or motorized” systems for removing material from the water. \n \n Contact reporter Heather Hacking at 896-7758.', 'Defense Secretary Ash Carter caused a stir Tuesday when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the $500 million program to train and equip “moderate” Syrian rebels to take on the Islamic State had so far yielded just 60 vetted candidates. \n \n Republicans quickly pounced on the number — far short of a goal for at least 5,400 fighters in the first year — as evidence that President Barack Obama’s strategy for defeating the terrorist group isn’t working, a day after the president defended the plan at a rare Pentagon press briefing. And Democrats quickly went into damage-control mode, noting there are valid reasons the number is so small. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) let Carter know during the Senate hearing that his remark had caused a ruckus on cable news, saying he’d just stepped out of the hearing for an appearance on CNN, and all the interviewer wanted to talk about, Nelson said, was Carter’s statement. \n \n The Pentagon chief acknowledged he’d caused a firestorm, saying he wasn’t surprised by all the attention his statement was getting but noting that Congress deserved “to know where things stand.” \n \n It wasn’t exactly the headline the White House was looking for the day after Obama reaffirmed at the Pentagon that his strategy to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was working, especially with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasting the president’s commitment to the strategy as delusional. \n \n But Carter’s acknowledgement that so few Syrians have made it through the vetting process also led a number of senators on both sides of the aisle to raise important questions about the viability of the train-and-equip program, asking why it’s so difficult to find moderate rebels willing to take on ISIL. \n \n Among the problems: stringent vetting standards, the U.S. requirement that rebels be willing to fight ISIL but not Syrian President Bashar Assad and the lack of a U.S. commitment to defend these troops from Assad’s advanced weapons. \n \n Carter told the Armed Services panel that about 7,000 volunteers were being screened for the train-and-equip program but that the vetting standards were slowing things down. \n \n The first problem is the basic vetting, which involves background checks, proof of identification and a pledge to obey the basic laws of war. Some volunteers have been booted from the program for simple reasons such as not meeting age requirements, one defense official told POLITICO, while others could not pass one or more layers of screening to protect the U.S. and allied troops conducting the effort. \n \n The second problem is the requirement that the Syrian volunteers must agree only to fight ISIL and not the Assad regime. U.S. officials say the “ISIL-first” strategy is essential because without a political structure in place to replace Assad if he died or left power, chaos in Syria would worsen and the state would fail, like in Libya. \n \n But many Syrians who have been brutalized in the civil war bear more animus toward Assad than toward ISIL, which is one reason why the “ISIL-first” commitment has winnowed out so many people who came forward. \n \n Still, Pentagon officials say they’re optimistic about increasing the throughput at the four sites that have been created for the train-and-equip effort in Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \n \n “As training progresses, we are learning more about the opposition groups and building important relationships, which increases our ability to attract recruits and provides valuable intelligence for counter-ISIL operations,” Carter said. \n \n McCain and other Republicans on the panel were unmoved. \n \n “It is not that we are doing nothing,” the Arizona senator said. “It is that there is no compelling reason to believe that anything we are currently doing will be sufficient to achieve the president’s stated goal of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL — either in the short term or the long term.” \n \n And he suggested there’s another major reason the U.S. has been having so much trouble with the “moderate” Syrian force — it won’t make any solid commitments to the people it’s recruiting. \n \n Unresolved questions about the support the U.S. would give the fighters have split the Obama administration for years, leading in part to the dismissal of Carter’s predecessor, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, who appeared with Carter before the committee Tuesday, acknowledged that a “debate” inside the administration continues about the effect that Assad has on the fight and to what degree his departure would help or hurt it. \n \n For McCain and other critics, the problems are more basic: People won’t sign up to risk their lives unless they’re certain the U.S. is willing to provide air cover, resupply them with ammunition and supplies, and offer other types of support, he said. McCain mocked Carter’s answer about the administration’s absence of a policy, saying that no wonder Syrians wouldn’t agree to join if the answer they got was that a “decision will be made later.” \n \n “It’s shameful to send people in and not assure them that we will defend them from attacks by barrel bombs,” McCain said. \n \n McCain, who has been Obama’s foremost foreign-policy critic, had several other heated exchanges with Carter during Tuesday’s hearing. The Pentagon chief sought to provide some cover for the president by offering examples of progress in the U.S.-led campaign to defeat the terrorist group that has declared its own state. \n \n Carter said the more than 5,000 airstrikes carried out by the United States and its coalition partners have “produced some clear tactical results,” putting ISIL “on the defensive,” with “its stronghold in Raqqah under pressure.” \n \n But the defense secretary also acknowledged setbacks, making clear the administration was not even close to where it had hoped to be in its efforts to train Iraqi and Syrian forces. \n \n As of June 30, he said, “we’ve only received enough trainees to be able to train” about 10,800 Iraqi troops, with an additional 4,600 in training. “I’ve told Iraqi leaders that while the United States is open to supporting Iraq more than we already are, we must see a greater commitment from all parts of the Iraqi government,” Carter said. \n \n And in Syria, he explained, the administration’s efforts to train and equip a force to take on ISIL were still in the “early stages.” \n \n “President Obama’s comments yesterday at the Pentagon reveal a disturbing degree of self-delusion,” McCain said. “None of the so-called progress that the president cited suggests that we are on a path to success.” \n \n Several Democrats stepped in to defend the defense secretary, including the panel’s ranking member, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island. \n \n “The pipeline is about 7,000,” Reed told POLITICO. “From that I think you’ll start seeing increased numbers. And then when you reach a critical mass, you start raising the question of where are they deployed, how are they deployed, are they supported.” \n \n But, Reed was quick to add, “It’s going to take time.”']",3,"– This winter's flooding in Northern California has done more than bring relief after years of drought; it's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years. Gold hunters in the area tell the Chico Enterprise-Record the floods have ""rearranged the rivers"" and ""move things around."" That means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer—which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997—stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. ""I'm going to have a ball,"" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time. (This treasure hunter is seeking $1 billion in gold from a sunken ship.)"
68,"[""It had been the perfect Father’s Day... a trip to the beach with his nine-year-old daughter, the youngest of his five children. \n \n So when Bill Hudson settled down with his laptop after dinner, he was looking forward to nothing more than a peaceful evening at home. \n \n Then he sat bolt upright. There, flashing up on the screen, was an Instagram photograph posted by his eldest son, the actor Oliver Hudson – his first-born child with ex-wife Goldie Hawn and brother of Bill’s older daughter Kate. \n \n Scroll down for video \n \n Ex: In a searingly raw interview with The Mail on Sunday last night, Bill Hudson (pictured) veering between tears of sadness and flashes of anger, vowed to ‘break all ties’ with his eldest children, actors Kate and Oliver \n \n Children: Goldie Hawn pictured with her daughter, Kate Hudson, (left) and son Oliver Hudson, (right) \n \n Taken more than 30 years ago, it showed a smiling Oliver and Kate as happy children, posing with their father. \n \n It was the caption beneath the photograph that cut Bill’s heart to the quick. Addressing his message to his sister, Oliver wrote: ‘Happy Abandonment Day....@katehudson.’ \n \n The post went viral, spawning thousands of comments as social media seethed with debate about absent fathers and whether being a biological father automatically earns a man the right to be called ‘dad’. \n \n Almost Famous actress Kate twisted the knife further by posting an intimate black and white photograph of herself alongside Goldie’s long-term love Kurt Russell saying: ‘Pa, just simply... thank you. Happy Father’s Day. I love you to the moon and back.’ \n \n The offending tweet: Oliver Hudson posted this picture of his father Bill, and sister Kate on Father's Day \n \n An undated photograph of Bill Hudson and Goldie Hawn - they went on to have two children together \n \n And as if to rub salt into Bill’s wounds, Oliver, too, posted a picture of himself with Kurt, adding the words: ‘Happy Father’s Day, Pa.’ \n \n For Bill, the anguish slowly turned to anger as the headlines raged and his ‘phone rang off the hook’. \n \n But he has maintained a dignified silence – until now. \n \n In a searingly raw interview with The Mail on Sunday last night, Bill, veering between tears of sadness and flashes of anger, vowed to ‘break all ties’ with his eldest children. \n \n ‘I say to them now, ‘“I set you free,” he pronounced, his voice breaking. ‘I had five birth children but I now consider myself a father of three. I no longer recognise Oliver and Kate as my own. \n \n ‘I would ask them to stop using the Hudson name. They are no longer a part of my life. Oliver’s Instagram post was a malicious, vicious, premeditated attack. He is dead to me now. As is Kate. I am mourning their loss even though they are still walking this earth.’ \n \n Kate twisted the knife by posting an intimate photograph of herself alongside Goldie’s long-term love Kurt Russell saying: ‘Pa, just simply... thank you. Happy Father’s Day. I love you to the moon and back' \n \n Oliver, too, posted a picture of himself with Kurt, adding the words: ‘Happy Father’s Day, Pa' \n \n It is a sad denouement to a decades-long family saga which, Bill says, ‘is more messed up and sad than any Hollywood screenplay could ever be’. \n \n For years, Bill and former wife Goldie have bickered publicly about Goldie’s claims that he all but abandoned the two famous siblings. \n \n Last night, in a blistering attack on Goldie, Tinseltown’s favourite ‘ditzy blonde’, Bill accused her of ‘wilfully alienating’ him from their two children. \n \n At the heart of the matter is what Bill calls the ‘Hollywoodisation’ of Goldie’s story. \n \n ‘When we split up, she never had a bad word to say about me,’ he says. ‘But when Kurt came on the scene, the narrative changed and I became the big, bad wolf. I would say to her “Goldie, why are you trashing me and saying I’m an absent father when it’s simply not the case?” and she’d laugh and go “Oh Bill, you know it makes for a better story”.’ \n \n Eventually, Bill says, the fiction became fact as first Kate, now 36, and then Oliver, 38, ‘drifted away’ from him and rejected his repeated pleas to remain part of their lives. He lays the blame at Goldie’s door. I believe the drip, drip, drip of poison which started when they were kids finally took hold,’ he says. ‘Goldie wanted to create this myth of a perfect family with Kurt and she wanted me out.’ \n \n Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson in happier times. For years, Bill and former wife Goldie have bickered publicly about Goldie’s claims that he all but abandoned the two famous siblings \n \n Things came to a final showdown a week ago with Oliver’s bitter post. \n \n ‘That was like a dagger to the heart,’ says Bill as he sits in the sun-dappled courtyard of a hotel near his ranch home in Malibu, California. ‘It’s time for the truth to come out.’ \n \n At 65, Bill still has the rugged good looks and easy charm that captivated Goldie when she was at the height of her fame. During their marriage, she became the highest-paid female star in the world thanks to quirky comedies such as Shampoo, There’s A Girl In My Soup and Private Benjamin. When the pair met in the first-class cabin of a New York to LA flight in 1975, Bill was a successful star in his own right with his group The Hudson Brothers, (‘the One Direction of our day,’ he quips). He had his own TV show and performed alongside The Beach Boys, The Osmonds and The Monkees. \n \n ‘The attraction was instant. I invited her out to dinner that night and that was it. The sex was mind-blowing. Even when everything else in the relationship turned sour, the sex was always amazing.’ \n \n The pair wed in 1976 when Goldie was already pregnant with Oliver. \n \n When their son was born at LA’s Cedars-Sinai hospital, Oliver suffered from the life-threatening condition meconium aspiration, when a newborn accidentally inhales contaminated amniotic fluid. \n \n ‘Oliver was in isolation for three days,’ says Bill. ‘Goldie and I were beside ourselves. She was really sick and I’d go from her bedside to the neonatal intensive care unit. The doctors didn’t think Oliver would make it. I was only 26 and in a state of shock. \n \n ‘Goldie and I were sobbing but Oliver pulled through and from that moment he was our precious miracle. \n \n ‘He was my first-born. I adored that child. When Kate came along, I loved her with all my heart, too. There was this deep love among the four of us for years. And that’s what makes it so difficult to say goodbye.’ \n \n Actors Oliver Hudson, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell arrive at amfAR The Foundation for AIDS in 2013 \n \n Bill says clouds formed in the relationship over his wife’s ‘free spirit’ and desire for an open relationship. \n \n ‘Goldie was having affairs. She told me pretty much on our wedding night she wanted an open marriage, that she couldn’t imagine being faithful to one man for the rest of her life.’ \n \n When Goldie made a film, Cactus Flower, in London, her mother Laura moved into the marital home – a magnificent £10 million beachside villa in Malibu – and helped Bill care for the children. \n \n ‘Oliver was three and Kate four months old. Goldie went to Europe for a month. I stayed home on Daddy duty. I later found out she’d been sleeping with one of her co-stars, French actor Yves Rénier. \n \n ‘I wanted a traditional marriage but Goldie couldn’t settle. Eventually I moved out.’ \n \n The marriage ended in 1981. Bill went on to have a long-term relationship with Love Story actress Ali MacGraw, before marrying Cindy Williams, star of TV comedy Laverne & Shirley. They had two children Emily, now 31, and Zachary, 28, before that marriage also ended in divorce. \n \n Goldie was having affairs. She told me pretty much on our wedding night she wanted an open marriage, that she couldn’t imagine being faithful to one man for the rest of her life \n \n His youngest child is Lalania, nine, from a long-term relationship with a woman to whom he remains ‘exceptionally close’. \n \n Meanwhile, Goldie met Kurt Russell in 1983. And while the pair have never married, their relationship is considered one of the happiest in Hollywood. ‘When we first split up, I took a house on the beach in Malibu to stay close to the kids,’ says Bill. ‘I was a part of their lives for years. Kate and Oliver came over at weekends, there were family holidays. \n \n In fact, the photograph that Oliver posted on Instagram was taken by Cindy while we were on holiday in Florida. Goldie wanted a vacation with Kurt because they’d just got together and so Cindy and I took the kids to DisneyWorld. Everything was cool.’ \n \n But he says Goldie used her increasing fame and financial superiority to ‘freeze’ him out. \n \n ‘I call it parental alienation. We had a custody arrangement but Goldie constantly flouted it. I’d turn up to see the kids and would discover Goldie had taken them on the private jet to her home in Colorado. \n \n 'She gave interviews about her “wonderful” relationship with Kurt and how the kids called him “Pa”. She described me as an absent father. I’d call her and go “Goldie, how can you say that?” but she’d just reply: “It’s a better story.” ’ \n \n As Kate’s fame grew she, too, accused her father of being an absentee dad: ‘There was never a birthday card,’ she complained, to which Bill responds: ‘Rubbish! I sent birthday cards every year. \n \n ‘I ring her up every birthday, still do. The same with Oliver. I bumped into Oliver fairly recently in a supermarket in Malibu and he gave me a hug. I always thought Oliver could be the peacemaker, that somehow he would help bring our fractured family back together. \n \n Actor Kurt Russell, with Goldie Hawn and her children, actress Kate Hudson and actor Oliver Hudson in 2004 \n \n ‘Goldie poisoned them against me. She told the kids I’d moved to Portland. I did go to Portland for eight months to make an album but then I came back to LA. I never abandoned my family. I never walked away. I wanted to be a father to Kate and Oliver but Goldie made it harder and harder for me to see them. It’s all about control. What Goldie wants, Goldie gets.’ \n \n He recalled going to mediation during their custody battle. ‘Goldie grabbed my forearm as we were leaving and said to me: “It’s all about the money and power, babe.”’ \n \n When Oliver and Kate were in their early teens, Bill decided to end the court battles and told the children his door was always open to them. ‘Oliver would come and stay with me. We’d go fishing, have sleep-overs. But Kate drifted away.’ \n \n The pair enjoyed an uneasy rapprochement when Kate started dating Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson, father of her elder son Ryder, 11. She also has a three-year-old son Bingham with British rocker Matt Bellamy, from whom she split last year after four years. \n \n ‘At one point, I was writing a letter to my children every week for a year. Did those letters ever get to them? Who knows? When I read some of the comments on social media, it was so hurtful. People believe the bull****. Well, I’m here to say it’s just not true.’ At first, Bill picks his words carefully over Kate’s Father’s Day photo of herself with Kurt. ‘It was an intimate shot and, as her father, I found it inappropriate and unsettling. I’ll leave it at that,’ he says. \n \n Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson at the 1975 Oscars (pictured left) and an undated picture of them (right) \n \n Then, angrily, he adds: ‘She wants to be Kurt’s daughter? Well then, take his name, stop using mine.’ \n \n He has removed photographs of Kate and Oliver from his home and even thrown away their knitted baby booties ‘which I carried in the glove compartment of every car I’ve ever owned for good luck’. \n \n Last week, Oliver posted a reply to one fan in which he was unrepentant, emphasising his closeness to Kurt Russell: ‘What started out as what I thought as a joke has turned into something more. And I embrace that. I’ve done and continue to do a lot of work on myself to better understand what make me tick. Yes, science links us but love binds us. OH + KR = ♥’ \n \n Bill is clearly still deeply wounded. He says: ‘Oliver could have picked up the phone and called me but he hasn’t. What shocks me is that this was clearly premeditated. He chose the photograph and posted it on Father’s Day, when he knew it would cause maximum pain. Oliver has lived in the shadow of his mother and sister all his life. Maybe he wanted to be in the headlines? \n \n ‘If what he wanted was me out of their lives, then he’s succeeded. I don’t want to see either of my eldest children ever again.

Playmobil issued a statement defending the toy as a portrayal of life on a 17th-century pirate ship. “If you look at the box, you can see that the pirate figure is clearly a crew member on the pirate ship and not a captive,” the statement reads. “The figure was meant to represent a pirate who was a former slave in a historical context."" But not everyone was mollified by the statement: The Post reports the president of the Sacramento NAACP is calling for the toy to be removed from shelves. In her Facebook post, the boy's aunt claims the pirate ship was the only Playmobil set she could find with a black figure. (Playmobil once demanded a pastor stop crucifying toys.)"

72,"['Latter-day Saints believe that the marriage of one man and one woman is the Lord’s standing law of marriage. In biblical times, the Lord commanded some to practice plural marriage—the marriage of one man and more than one woman. 1 By revelation, the Lord commanded Joseph Smith to institute the practice of plural marriage among Church members in the early 1840s. For more than half a century, plural marriage was practiced by some Latter-day Saints under the direction of the Church President. 2 \n \n Latter-day Saints do not understand all of God’s purposes in instituting, through His prophets, the practice of plural marriage. The Book of Mormon identifies one reason for God to command it: to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant in order to “raise up seed unto [the Lord].”3 \n \n Plural marriage did result in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes. It also shaped 19th-century Mormon society in many ways: marriage became available to virtually all who desired it; per-capita inequality of wealth was diminished as economically disadvantaged women married into more financially stable households; and ethnic intermarriages were increased, which helped to unite a diverse immigrant population. Plural marriage also helped create and strengthen a sense of cohesion and group identification among Latter-day Saints. Church members came to see themselves as a “peculiar people,” covenant-bound to carry out the commands of God despite outside opposition.4 \n \n The Beginnings of Plural Marriage in the Church \n \n Polygamy had been permitted for millennia in many cultures and religions, but, with few exceptions, it was rejected in Western cultures. In Joseph Smith’s time, monogamy was the only legal form of marriage in the United States. \n \n The revelation on plural marriage, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, emerged partly from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831. Latter-day Saints understood that they were living in the latter days, in what the revelations called the “dispensation of the fulness of times.”5 Ancient principles—such as prophets, priesthood, and temples—would be restored to the earth. Plural marriage, practiced by ancient patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, was one of those ancient principles.6 \n \n The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was embedded within a revelation about eternal marriage—the teaching that marriage could last beyond death. Monogamous and plural marriages performed by priesthood power could seal loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness.7 \n \n The revelation on marriage stated general principles; it did not explain how to implement plural marriage in all its particulars. In Nauvoo, Joseph Smith married additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The practice was introduced carefully and incrementally, and participants vowed to keep their participation confidential, anticipating a time when husbands and wives could acknowledge one another publicly. \n \n If you would like to learn more about the beginnings of plural marriage in the Church, click here. \n \n Plural Marriage and Families in 19th-Century Utah \n \n Between 1852 and 1890, Latter-day Saints openly practiced plural marriage. Most plural families lived in Utah. Women and men who lived within plural marriage attested to challenges and difficulties but also to the love and joy they found within their families. They believed it was a commandment of God at that time and that obedience would bring great blessings to them and their posterity. Church leaders taught that participants in plural marriages should seek to develop a generous spirit of unselfishness and the pure love of Christ for everyone involved. \n \n Although some leaders had large polygamous families, two-thirds of polygamist men had only two wives at a time. Church leaders recognized that plural marriages could be particularly difficult for women. Divorce was therefore available to women who were unhappy in their marriages; remarriage was also readily available. Women sometimes married at young ages in the first decade of Utah settlement, which was typical of women living in frontier areas at the time. At its peak in 1857, perhaps one half of all Utah Latter-day Saints experienced plural marriage as a husband, wife, or child. The percentage of those involved in plural marriage steadily declined over the next three decades. \n \n During the years that plural marriage was publicly taught, not all Latter-day Saints were expected to live the principle, though all were expected to accept it as a revelation from God. Indeed, this system of marriage could not have been universal due to the ratio of men to women. Women were free to choose their spouses, whether to enter into a polygamous or a monogamous union, or whether to marry at all. Some men entered plural marriage because they were asked to do so by Church leaders, while others initiated the process themselves; all were required to obtain the approval of Church leaders before entering a plural marriage. \n \n If you would like to learn more about plural marriage and families in Utah, click here. \n \n Anti-Polygamy Legislation and the End of Plural Marriage \n \n Beginning in 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage. After the U.S. Supreme Court found the anti-polygamy laws to be constitutional in 1879, federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives during the 1880s. Believing these laws to be unjust, Latter-day Saints engaged in civil disobedience by continuing to practice plural marriage and by attempting to avoid arrest by moving to the homes of friends or family or by hiding under assumed names. When convicted, they paid fines and submitted to jail time. \n \n One of the anti-polygamy laws permitted the U.S. government to seize Church property. Federal officers soon threatened to take Latter-day Saint temples. The work of salvation for both the living and the dead was now in jeopardy. In September 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff felt inspired to issue the Manifesto. “Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages,” President Woodruff explained, “I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.”8 \n \n The full implications of the document were not apparent at first. The Lord’s way is to speak “line upon line; here a little, there a little.”9 Like the beginning of plural marriage in the Church, the end of the practice was gradual and incremental, a process filled with difficulties and uncertainties. \n \n The Manifesto declared President Woodruff’s intention to submit to the laws of the United States, and new plural marriages within that jurisdiction largely came to an end. But a small number of plural marriages continued to be performed in Mexico and Canada, under the sanction of some Church leaders. As a rule, these marriages were not promoted by Church leaders and were difficult to get approved. Either one or both of the spouses who entered into these unions typically had to agree to remain in Canada or Mexico. On an exceptional basis, a smaller number of plural marriages were performed within the United States between the years 1890 and 1904. \n \n The Church’s role in these marriages became a subject of intense public debate after Reed Smoot, an Apostle, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903. At the April 1904 general conference, Church President Joseph F. Smith issued a forceful statement, known as the Second Manifesto, making new plural marriages punishable by excommunication.10 Since President Smith’s day, Church Presidents have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriage and have underscored the sincerity of their words by urging local leaders to bring noncompliant members before Church disciplinary councils. \n \n If you would like to learn more about the end of plural marriage in the Church, click here. \n \n Conclusion \n \n Plural marriage was among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration. For many who practiced it, plural marriage was a trial of faith. It violated both cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution and revilement. Despite these hardships, plural marriage benefited the Church in innumerable ways. Through the lineage of these 19th-century Saints have come many Latter-day Saints who have been faithful to their gospel covenants as righteous mothers and fathers; loyal disciples of Jesus Christ; devoted Church members, leaders, and missionaries; and good citizens and prominent public officials. Modern Latter-day Saints honor and respect these faithful pioneers who gave so much for their faith, families, and community. \n \n Resources \n \n The Church acknowledges the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented in this article; their work is used with permission. \n \n Originally published October 2014.', 'After receiving a revelation commanding him to practice plural marriage, Joseph Smith married multiple wives and introduced the practice to close associates. This principle was among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration—for Joseph personally and for other Church members. Plural marriage tested faith and provoked controversy and opposition. Few Latter-day Saints initially welcomed the restoration of a biblical practice entirely foreign to their sensibilities. But many later testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their hesitation and gave them courage to accept this practice. \n \n Latter-day Saints believe that monogamy—the marriage of one man and one woman—is the Lord’s standing law of marriage. 1 In biblical times, the Lord commanded some of His people to practice plural marriage—the marriage of one man and more than one woman. 2 Some early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also received and obeyed this commandment given through God’s prophets. \n \n Although the Lord commanded the adoption—and later the cessation—of plural marriage in the latter days, He did not give exact instructions on how to obey the commandment. Significant social and cultural changes often include misunderstandings and difficulties. Church leaders and members experienced these challenges as they heeded the command to practice plural marriage and again later as they worked to discontinue it after Church President Wilford Woodruff issued an inspired statement known as the Manifesto in 1890, which led to the end of plural marriage in the Church. Through it all, Church leaders and members sought to follow God’s will. \n \n Many details about the early practice of plural marriage are unknown. Plural marriage was introduced among the early Saints incrementally, and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. They did not discuss their experiences publicly or in writing until after the Latter-day Saints had moved to Utah and Church leaders had publicly acknowledged the practice. The historical record of early plural marriage is therefore thin: few records of the time provide details, and later reminiscences are not always reliable. Some ambiguity will always accompany our knowledge about this issue. Like the participants, we “see through a glass, darkly” and are asked to walk by faith.3 \n \n The Beginnings of Plural Marriage in the Church \n \n The revelation on plural marriage was not written down until 1843, but its early verses suggest that part of it emerged from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831. People who knew Joseph well later stated he received the revelation about that time.4 The revelation, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, states that Joseph prayed to know why God justified Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon in having many wives. The Lord responded that He had commanded them to enter into the practice.5 \n \n Latter-day Saints understood that they were living in the latter days, in what the revelations called the “dispensation of the fulness of times.”6 Ancient principles—such as prophets, priesthood, and temples—would be restored to the earth. Plural marriage was one of those ancient principles. \n \n Polygamy had been permitted for millennia in many cultures and religions, but, with few exceptions, was rejected in Western cultures.7 In Joseph Smith’s time, monogamy was the only legal form of marriage in the United States. Joseph knew the practice of plural marriage would stir up public ire. After receiving the commandment, he taught a few associates about it, but he did not spread this teaching widely in the 1830s.8 \n \n When God commands a difficult task, He sometimes sends additional messengers to encourage His people to obey. Consistent with this pattern, Joseph told associates that an angel appeared to him three times between 1834 and 1842 and commanded him to proceed with plural marriage when he hesitated to move forward. During the third and final appearance, the angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.9 \n \n Fragmentary evidence suggests that Joseph Smith acted on the angel’s first command by marrying a plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio, in the mid-1830s. Several Latter-day Saints who had lived in Kirtland reported decades later that Joseph Smith had married Alger, who lived and worked in the Smith household, after he had obtained her consent and that of her parents.10 Little is known about this marriage, and nothing is known about the conversations between Joseph and Emma regarding Alger. After the marriage with Alger ended in separation, Joseph seems to have set the subject of plural marriage aside until after the Church moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. \n \n Plural Marriage and Eternal Marriage \n \n The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was part of a larger revelation given to Joseph Smith—that marriage could last beyond death and that eternal marriage was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children. As early as 1840, Joseph Smith privately taught Apostle Parley P. Pratt that the “heavenly order” allowed Pratt and his wife to be together “for time and all eternity.”11 Joseph also taught that men like Pratt—who had remarried following the death of his first wife—could be married (or sealed) to their wives for eternity, under the proper conditions.12 \n \n The sealing of husband and wife for eternity was made possible by the restoration of priesthood keys and ordinances. On April 3, 1836, the Old Testament prophet Elijah appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple and restored the priesthood keys necessary to perform ordinances for the living and the dead, including sealing families together.13 Marriages performed by priesthood authority could link loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness; marriages performed without this authority would end at death.14 \n \n Marriage performed by priesthood authority meant that the procreation of children and perpetuation of families would continue into the eternities. Joseph Smith’s revelation on marriage declared that the “continuation of the seeds forever and ever” helped to fulfill God’s purposes for His children.15 This promise was given to all couples who were married by priesthood authority and were faithful to their covenants. \n \n Plural Marriage in Nauvoo \n \n For much of Western history, family “interest”—economic, political, and social considerations—dominated the choice of spouse. Parents had the power to arrange marriages or forestall unions of which they disapproved. By the late 1700s, romance and personal choice began to rival these traditional motives and practices.16 By Joseph Smith’s time, many couples insisted on marrying for love, as he and Emma did when they eloped against her parents’ wishes. \n \n Latter-day Saints’ motives for plural marriage were often more religious than economic or romantic. Besides the desire to be obedient, a strong incentive was the hope of living in God’s presence with family members. In the revelation on marriage, the Lord promised participants “crowns of eternal lives” and “exaltation in the eternal worlds.”17 Men and women, parents and children, ancestors and progeny were to be “sealed” to each other—their commitment lasting into the eternities, consistent with Jesus’s promise that priesthood ordinances performed on earth could be “bound in heaven.”18 \n \n The first plural marriage in Nauvoo took place when Louisa Beaman and Joseph Smith were sealed in April 1841.19 Joseph married many additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The practice spread slowly at first. By June 1844, when Joseph died, approximately 29 men and 50 women had entered into plural marriage, in addition to Joseph and his wives. When the Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, at least 196 men and 521 women had entered into plural marriages.20 Participants in these early plural marriages pledged to keep their involvement confidential, though they anticipated a time when the practice would be publicly acknowledged. \n \n Nevertheless, rumors spread. A few men unscrupulously used these rumors to seduce women to join them in an unauthorized practice sometimes referred to as “spiritual wifery.” When this was discovered, the men were cut off from the Church.21 The rumors prompted members and leaders to issue carefully worded denials that denounced spiritual wifery and polygamy but were silent about what Joseph Smith and others saw as divinely mandated “celestial” plural marriage.22 The statements emphasized that the Church practiced no marital law other than monogamy while implicitly leaving open the possibility that individuals, under direction of God’s living prophet, might do so.23 \n \n Joseph Smith and Plural Marriage \n \n During the era in which plural marriage was practiced, Latter-day Saints distinguished between sealings for time and eternity and sealings for eternity only. Sealings for time and eternity included commitments and relationships during this life, generally including the possibility of sexual relations. Eternity-only sealings indicated relationships in the next life alone. \n \n Evidence indicates that Joseph Smith participated in both types of sealings. The exact number of women to whom he was sealed in his lifetime is unknown because the evidence is fragmentary.24 Some of the women who were sealed to Joseph Smith later testified that their marriages were for time and eternity, while others indicated that their relationships were for eternity alone.25 \n \n Most of those sealed to Joseph Smith were between 20 and 40 years of age at the time of their sealing to him. The oldest, Fanny Young, was 56 years old. The youngest was Helen Mar Kimball, daughter of Joseph’s close friends Heber C. and Vilate Murray Kimball, who was sealed to Joseph several months before her 15th birthday. Marriage at such an age, inappropriate by today’s standards, was legal in that era, and some women married in their mid-teens.26 Helen Mar Kimball spoke of her sealing to Joseph as being “for eternity alone,” suggesting that the relationship did not involve sexual relations.27 After Joseph’s death, Helen remarried and became an articulate defender of him and of plural marriage.28 \n \n Following his marriage to Louisa Beaman and before he married other single women, Joseph Smith was sealed to a number of women who were already married.29 Neither these women nor Joseph explained much about these sealings, though several women said they were for eternity alone.30 Other women left no records, making it unknown whether their sealings were for time and eternity or were for eternity alone. \n \n There are several possible explanations for this practice. These sealings may have provided a way to create an eternal bond or link between Joseph’s family and other families within the Church.31 These ties extended both vertically, from parent to child, and horizontally, from one family to another. Today such eternal bonds are achieved through the temple marriages of individuals who are also sealed to their own birth families, in this way linking families together. Joseph Smith’s sealings to women already married may have been an early version of linking one family to another. In Nauvoo, most if not all of the first husbands seem to have continued living in the same household with their wives during Joseph’s lifetime, and complaints about these sealings with Joseph Smith are virtually absent from the documentary record.32 \n \n These sealings may also be explained by Joseph’s reluctance to enter plural marriage because of the sorrow it would bring to his wife Emma. He may have believed that sealings to married women would comply with the Lord’s command without requiring him to have normal marriage relationships.33 This could explain why, according to Lorenzo Snow, the angel reprimanded Joseph for having “demurred” on plural marriage even after he had entered into the practice.34 After this rebuke, according to this interpretation, Joseph returned primarily to sealings with single women. \n \n Another possibility is that, in an era when life spans were shorter than they are today, faithful women felt an urgency to be sealed by priesthood authority. Several of these women were married either to non-Mormons or former Mormons, and more than one of the women later expressed unhappiness in their present marriages. Living in a time when divorce was difficult to obtain, these women may have believed a sealing to Joseph Smith would give them blessings they might not otherwise receive in the next life.35 \n \n The women who united with Joseph Smith in plural marriage risked reputation and self-respect in being associated with a principle so foreign to their culture and so easily misunderstood by others. “I made a greater sacrifice than to give my life,” said Zina Huntington Jacobs, “for I never anticipated again to be looked upon as an honorable woman.” Nevertheless, she wrote, “I searched the scripture & by humble prayer to my Heavenly Father I obtained a testimony for myself.”36 After Joseph’s death, most of the women sealed to him moved to Utah with the Saints, remained faithful Church members, and defended both plural marriage and Joseph.37 \n \n Joseph and Emma \n \n Plural marriage was difficult for all involved. For Joseph Smith’s wife Emma, it was an excruciating ordeal. Records of Emma’s reactions to plural marriage are sparse; she left no firsthand accounts, making it impossible to reconstruct her thoughts. Joseph and Emma loved and respected each other deeply. After he had entered into plural marriage, he poured out his feelings in his journal for his “beloved Emma,” whom he described as “undaunted, firm and unwavering, unchangeable, affectionate Emma.” After Joseph’s death, Emma kept a lock of his hair in a locket she wore around her neck.38 \n \n Emma approved, at least for a time, of four of Joseph Smith’s plural marriages in Nauvoo, and she accepted all four of those wives into her household. She may have approved of other marriages as well.39 But Emma likely did not know about all of Joseph’s sealings.40 She vacillated in her view of plural marriage, at some points supporting it and at other times denouncing it. \n \n In the summer of 1843, Joseph Smith dictated the revelation on marriage, a lengthy and complex text containing both glorious promises and stern warnings, some directed at Emma.41 The revelation instructed women and men that they must obey God’s law and commands in order to receive the fulness of His glory. \n \n The revelation on marriage required that a wife give her consent before her husband could enter into plural marriage.42 Nevertheless, toward the end of the revelation, the Lord said that if the first wife “receive not this law”—the command to practice plural marriage—the husband would be “exempt from the law of Sarah,” presumably the requirement that the husband gain the consent of the first wife before marrying additional women.43 After Emma opposed plural marriage, Joseph was placed in an agonizing dilemma, forced to choose between the will of God and the will of his beloved Emma. He may have thought Emma’s rejection of plural marriage exempted him from the law of Sarah. Her decision to “receive not this law” permitted him to marry additional wives without her consent. Because of Joseph’s early death and Emma’s decision to remain in Nauvoo and not discuss plural marriage after the Church moved west, many aspects of their story remain known only to the two of them. \n \n Trial and Spiritual Witness \n \n Years later in Utah, participants in Nauvoo plural marriage discussed their motives for entering into the practice. God declared in the Book of Mormon that monogamy was the standard; at times, however, He commanded plural marriage so His people could “raise up seed unto [Him].”44 Plural marriage did result in an increased number of children born to believing parents.45 \n \n Some Saints also saw plural marriage as a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement. According to Helen Mar Kimball, Joseph Smith stated that “the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.” Though it was one of the “severest” trials of her life, she testified that it had also been “one of the greatest blessings.”46 Her father, Heber C. Kimball, agreed. “I never felt more sorrowful,” he said of the moment he learned of plural marriage in 1841. “I wept days. … I had a good wife. I was satisfied.”47 \n \n The decision to accept such a wrenching trial usually came only after earnest prayer and intense soul-searching. Brigham Young said that, upon learning of plural marriage, “it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave.”48 “I had to pray unceasingly,” he said, “and I had to exercise faith and the Lord revealed to me the truth of it and that satisfied me.”49 Heber C. Kimball found comfort only after his wife Vilate had a visionary experience attesting to the rightness of plural marriage. “She told me,” Vilate’s daughter later recalled, “she never saw so happy a man as father was when she described the vision and told him she was satisfied and knew it was from God.”50 \n \n Lucy Walker recalled her inner turmoil when Joseph Smith invited her to become his wife. “Every feeling of my soul revolted against it,” she wrote. Yet, after several restless nights on her knees in prayer, she found relief as her room “filled with a holy influence” akin to “brilliant sunshine.” She said, “My soul was filled with a calm sweet peace that I never knew,” and “supreme happiness took possession of my whole being.”51 \n \n Not all had such experiences. Some Latter-day Saints rejected the principle of plural marriage and left the Church, while others declined to enter the practice but remained faithful.52 Nevertheless, for many women and men, initial revulsion and anguish was followed by struggle, resolution, and ultimately, light and peace. Sacred experiences enabled the Saints to move forward in faith.53 \n \n Conclusion \n \n The challenge of introducing a principle as controversial as plural marriage is almost impossible to overstate. A spiritual witness of its truthfulness allowed Joseph Smith and other Latter-day Saints to accept this principle. Difficult as it was, the introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed “raise up seed” unto God. A substantial number of today’s members descend through faithful Latter-day Saints who practiced plural marriage. \n \n Church members no longer practice plural marriage.54 Consistent with Joseph Smith’s teachings, the Church permits a man whose wife has died to be sealed to another woman when he remarries. Moreover, members are permitted to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth, sealing them to all of the spouses to whom they were legally married. The precise nature of these relationships in the next life is not known, and many family relationships will be sorted out in the life to come. Latter-day Saints are encouraged to trust in our wise Heavenly Father, who loves His children and does all things for their growth and salvation.55 \n \n Resources \n \n The Church acknowledges the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented in this article; their work is used with permission. \n \n Originally published October 2014.']",2,"– The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled ""Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,"" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that ""careful estimates"" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the ""biggest bombshell for some."" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed ""for eternity alone,"" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were ""for time and eternity""). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the ""wrenching trial"" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that ""the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.""

73,"['Obama’s Midterm Loss Record Could Make History \n \n By Stuart Rothenberg \n \n President Barack Obama is about to do what no president has done in the past 50 years: Have two horrible, terrible, awful midterm elections in a row. \n \n In fact, Obama is likely to have the worst midterm numbers of any two-term president going back to Democrat Harry S. Truman. \n \n Truman lost a total of 83 House seats during his two midterms (55 seats in 1946 and 28 seats in 1950), while Republican Dwight Eisenhower lost a combined 66 House seats in the 1954 and 1958 midterms. \n \n Obama had one midterm where his party lost 63 House seats, and Democrats are expected to lose another 5 to possibly 12 House seats (or more), taking the sitting president’s total midterm House loses to the 68 seat to 75 seat range. \n \n (Join us on Election Night: Live Stream With Analysis, Results and More at RollCall.com) \n \n Most recent presidents have one disastrous midterm and another midterm that was not terrible. \n \n The GOP lost 30 House seats in George W. Bush’s second midterm, but gained 8 seats in his first midterm for a net loss of 22 seats. The party lost 26 seats in Ronald Reagan’s first midterm, but a mere 5 seats in his second midterm for a net loss of 31 seats. \n \n Democrats got shellacked in 1994, losing 54 seats in Bill Clinton’s first midterm, but the party gained 5 House seats in 1998, Clinton’s six-year-itch election, for a net Clinton loss of 49 House seats. (The figures don’t include special elections during a president’s term.) \n \n Looking at Senate losses, Republicans lost a net of 5 seats in George W. Bush’s two midterms, while Republicans lost a net of 7 seats during Ronald Reagan’s two midterms and Democrats lost a net of 8 seats during Bill Clinton’s two midterms. (Again, these numbers do not reflect party switches or special elections.) \n \n Democrats have a chance to tie the number of Senate losses that Republicans suffered during the midterms of Eisenhower, when the GOP lost a net of 13 Senate seats (12 in 1958 and only one in 1954). \n \n Democrats lost 6 Senate seats in 2010 and seem likely to lose from 5 to as many as 10 seats next week. That would add up to Obama midterm Senate losses of from 11 seats to as many as 16 seats. \n \n Democrats will likely not exceed the number of Senate losses they incurred during the two Truman midterms, in 1946 and 1950, when the party lost a remarkable net of 17 seats. \n \n (Interactive: How Much Is Your Member of Congress Worth?) \n \n Are the Democrats’ losses due to the increasingly partisan nature of our elections and the makeup of the past two Senate classes, or is the president at least partially to blame because he failed to show leadership on key issues and never successfully moved to the political center? \n \n The answer, most obviously, is, “Yes.” \n \n Correction, 10:15 a.m. A previous version of this story misstated the year in which the Democrats lost 6 Senate seats during President Barack Obama’s tenure. \n \n Related: \n \n A Nerve-Wracking Finish for Democrats \n \n Democrats Run From Harry Reid \n \n McConnell: Obamacare Repeal Will Take 60 Votes (Updated) \n \n Democrats Losing Youth Vote: Millennials Turning to the GOP \n \n Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat \n \n Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.', ""Senate Democrats have long awaited the 2010 tea party wave to splash back on Republicans during the 2016 election cycle. \n \n That moment is almost here. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n After two years of obsessive focus on the teetering reelection prospects of red-state Democrats, the attention is about to shift in a major way to blue-state Republicans. Six of them who rode anti-Obama sentiment to office in 2010 are up in two years, and they’ll face the dual challenge of a more diverse electorate and potentially Hillary Clinton atop the Democratic ticket. \n \n The leftward-tilting map means a GOP-controlled Senate could be short-lived if the party prevails on Tuesday. Even in the best-case scenario for the party, a Republican majority is certain to be slim. \n \n (POLITICO's 2014 race ratings) \n \n A half-dozen first-term Republicans are up for reelection in states President Barack Obama won in both 2008 and 2012: Mark Kirk of Illinois, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rob Portman of Ohio, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Marco Rubio of Florida. Obama also twice carried Sen. Chuck Grassley’s Iowa, but the longtime incumbent would be much tougher to dislodge. \n \n Add it all up and it’s basically the mirror image of 2014. \n \n “We shift the ground from where it was this time — seven Democrats were running in states that Obama didn’t carry — to an environment where seven Republicans are running in states that Obama did carry,” said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of GOP leadership up for reelection in 2016. \n \n Republicans are trying to look at the bright side of the intimidating terrain. If the GOP proves itself a responsible steward of Congress over the next two years, Republicans believe voters will be less inclined to oust vulnerable GOP incumbents. \n \n (WATCH: Driving the Election Day: Colorado) \n \n “If there’s an advantage to Republicans in the 2016 campaign … it’s the chance that you had to finally make the case,” said Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, the current National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman. \n \n Democrats are also eyeing incumbents in states that Obama won in 2008 but lost four years later: Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana and Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, both of whom have under $800,000 on hand. Meanwhile, potential primary challenges could loom for Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — plus Blunt, Moran and South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a GOP leader, depending on the mood of conservative insurgents. \n \n With House Republicans expected to pad their majority this November and possibly put the chamber out of reach in 2016, the battle for the Senate is expected to be the main undercard to the presidential election. And Senate Democratic insiders couldn’t be more excited for it, unable to recall a more favorable climate. \n \n (Full 2014 election results) \n \n “They start from a defensive crouch,” said one Senate Democratic aide of the Republicans. “It’s very unlikely that if they get a majority it will last longer than two years.” \n \n There are select pick-up opportunities for Republicans, too. The biggest potential trophy is Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who is up for reelection in Nevada. One formidable potential challenger is Gov. Brian Sandoval, a popular moderate governor. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) is the other obvious target for the GOP. \n \n But for now, those are minor worries for Democrats. \n \n (From POLITICO Magazine: Bet on a GOP Senate majority) \n \n Both parties separate the blue-state GOP pack into two tiers of vulnerability. At the top of Democrats’ hit list and Republicans’ fears are the conservative Toomey and Johnson and the moderate Kirk. Their home states haven’t gone for Republican presidential candidates since the ’80s. \n \n “You have to say that Toomey and Ron Johnson will have very competitive races,” said Charlie Black, an informal adviser to McCain. “Mark Kirk … won in that state before. He can again, [but] he’ll be the underdog.” \n \n Names of several potential challengers are already being floated, according to party insiders. Democratic state Attorney General Lisa Madigan has been mentioned as a candidate in Illinois. Former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) could opt for a rematch against Johnson. And two names have surfaced in Pennsylvania: Attorney General Kathleen Kane and former Rep. Joe Sestak (D), who’s raising money for a rematch of his 2010 loss. \n \n Toomey’s war chest sits at $5.4 million in cash at the end of September, Kirk has $1.5 million and Johnson has $669,000. Each spent more than $14 million in 2010, according to OpenSecrets. \n \n “They’re not going to be caught by surprise,” said Kevin Madden, a former top campaign hand for Mitt Romney. “Those are folks that were counted as underdogs when they won.”""]",2,"– Most of the national attention in Tuesday's election is focused on GOP gains in the Senate, but Roll Call points out that Republicans also are poised to hand President Obama a milestone he'd rather avoid in the House. Consider that Democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 (or maybe more) seats on Tuesday. No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016. So even if Republicans win a small majority this year, they might have to give it right back two years later."
74,"['Humankind’s common ancestor with other mammals may have been a roughly rat-size animal that weighed no more than a half a pound, had a long furry tail and lived on insects. \n \n In a comprehensive six-year study of the mammalian family tree, scientists have identified and reconstructed what they say is the most likely common ancestor of the many species on the most abundant and diverse branch of that tree — the branch of creatures that nourish their young in utero through a placenta. The work appears to support the view that in the global extinctions some 66 million years ago, all non-avian dinosaurs had to die for mammals to flourish. \n \n Scientists had been searching for just such a common genealogical link and have found it in a lowly occupant of the fossil record, Protungulatum donnae, that until now has been so obscure that it lacks a colloquial nickname. But as researchers reported Thursday in the journal Science, the animal had several anatomical characteristics for live births that anticipated all placental mammals and led to some 5,400 living species, from shrews to elephants, bats to whales, cats to dogs and, not least, humans. \n \n A team of researchers described the discovery as an important insight into the pattern and timing of early mammal life and a demonstration of the capabilities of a new system for handling copious amounts of fossil and genetic data in the service of evolutionary biology. The formidable new technology is expected to be widely applied in years ahead to similar investigations of plants, insects, fish and fowl. \n \n Given some belated stature by an artist’s brush, the animal hardly looks the part of a progenitor of so many mammals (which do not include marsupials, like kangaroos and opossums, or monotremes, egg-laying mammals like the duck-billed platypus). \n \n Maureen A. O’Leary of Stony Brook University on Long Island, a leader of the project and the principal author of the journal report, wrote that a combination of genetic and anatomical data established that the ancestor emerged within 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great dying at the end of the Cretaceous period. At the time, the meek were rapidly inheriting the earth from hulking predators like T. rex. \n \n Within another two million to three million years, Dr. O’Leary said, the first members of modern placental orders appeared in such profusion that researchers have started to refer to the explosive model of mammalian evolution. The common ancestor itself appeared more than 36 million years later than had been estimated based on genetic data alone. \n \n Although some small primitive mammals had lived in the shadow of the great Cretaceous reptiles, the scientists could not find evidence supporting an earlier hypothesis that up to 39 placental mammalian lineages survived to enter the post-extinction world. Only the stem lineage to Placentalia, they said, appeared to hang on through the catastrophe, generally associated with climate change after an asteroid crashed into Earth. \n \n The research team drew on combined fossil evidence and genetic data encoded in DNA in evaluating the ancestor’s standing as an early placental mammal. Among characteristics associated with full-term live births, the Protungulatum species was found to have a two-horned uterus and a placenta in which the maternal blood came in close contact with the membranes surrounding the fetus, as in humans. \n \n The ancestor’s younger age, the scientists said, ruled out the breakup of the supercontinent of Gondwana around 120 million years ago as a direct factor in the diversification of mammals, as has sometimes been speculated. Evidence of the common ancestor was found in North America, but the animal may have existed on other continents as well. \n \n The publicly accessible database responsible for the findings is called MorphoBank, with advanced software for handling the largest compilation yet of data and images on mammals living and extinct. “This has stretched our own expertise,” Dr. O’Leary, an anatomist, said in an interview. \n \n “The findings were not a total surprise,” she said. “But it’s an important discovery because it relies on lots of information from fossils and also molecular data. Other scientists, at least a thousand, some from other countries, are already signing up to use MorphoBank.”', 'What\'s cute and furry and has a name only a paleontologist could love? \n \n A tiny theoretical creature dubbed the ""hypothetical placental mammal ancestor"" is stealing the hearts of some evolutionary biologists — and annoying others — as it raises new debate over just when our early mammal ancestors began diversifying across the globe. \n \n In a paper published this week in the journal Science, an international team of researchers described how they used a vast database of fossil and anatomical data, as well as DNA evidence, to reverse-engineer an ancestor to the largest group of living mammals. \n \n The scientists theorized that this hypothetical critter would have begun to diversify into new species of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs roughly 66 million years ago — a concept at odds with some current thinking. \n \n ""This is fairly novel, to reconstruct an ancestor,"" said study coauthor and paleontologist Mike Novacek, the provost of science at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. ""I don\'t know of any other."" \n \n Placental mammals, including humans, make up the largest branch of the mammalian family tree. Only marsupials and a small number of egg-laying mammals are excluded. \n \n For the last several decades, scientists have debated just when it was that placental mammals began their explosive proliferation. Estimates based on DNA, or so-called molecular evidence, suggest that placental mammals appeared in the mid-Cretaceous period when dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops still trod the Earth. \n \n However, scientists have yet to uncover evidence of placental fossils during this period, according to the authors of the new study. They argue that this is because placental mammals began to diversify only several hundred thousand years after the demise of non-avian dinosaurs, in the Paleocene epoch. \n \n ""An environment that radically changed may have offered more opportunities for a new group to take form and radiate,"" Novacek said. \n \n Using a vast online database called Morphobank, the team of 23 scientists built a composite of the hypothetical ancestor based on the morphology, or appearance, of existing and extinct animals, along with the DNA data. Study coauthor Maureen O\'Leary, a paleontologist at Stony Brook University in New York, likened the process to reassembling a crime scene from thousands of bits of evidence. \n \n Over a period of six years, the researchers developed a highly specific picture of an unassuming little animal whose descendants would one day include whales, bats, lions and people. \n \n ""The placental ancestor was a scampering species that had a diet of insects, a fleshy nose, a light underbelly in its fur, and a long tail,"" O\'Leary said. ""It was larger than a mouse, but smaller than a rat."" \n \n Based on their findings, the scientists said placental mammals began their spread about 36 million years later than estimates based on the DNA-derived molecular clock model. \n \n The research team also contradicted the molecular clock-based theory that placental mammals developed into different species because of the fragmentation of the supercontinent Gondwana, millions of years before the dinosaurs vanished. In addition, the study concluded that a subset of placental mammals known as Afrotheria, which includes elephants and aardvarks, did not originate in Africa as commonly believed; instead, authors say they arose in the Americas. \n \n Not all evolutionary biologists have fallen in love with the furry, hypothetical bug eater, however. Argument over the rise of placental mammals is likely to continue for some time. \n \n ""The bottom line is that this study is not convincing and will not settle the debate,"" said Mark Springer, an evolutionary geneticist at UC Riverside who was not part of the research team. \n \n Using fossils to establish branches of a family tree can result in mistaken groupings of species, Springer said, because some traits are passed along by related species while other traits develop in parallel with more distantly related species. This is known as convergent evolution, and Springer said he was not convinced that study authors had addressed that issue. \n \n Study coauthor Novacek said he did not expect the paper to end discussion on the matter, but he hoped it would add weight to an ongoing argument. \n \n ""I think this will reinforce the notion that the fossil record is not in agreement with what\'s been reconstructed by molecular clocks,"" Novacek said. ""As data accumulates, the case for this late origin becomes better and better."" \n \n Another debate is brewing over whether the hypothetical creature deserves a less cumbersome moniker. \n \n ""People who think this organism is cute have asked me for a name,"" Novacek said. ""I tell them we can\'t give it a Latin name, because it never really existed."" \n \n monte.morin@latimes.com', 'The study also found that older people still in first marriages have sex more often than those who have remarried \n \n While people in the early years of marriage have sex more frequently, and their sexual activity tapers off over time, a slight rebound occurs for those whose marriages endure longer than half a century, according to new research. \n \n The study also found that people who remain in their first marriages have sex more frequently than those who remarry. But frequency aside, marriage order made no difference when it came to actual physical pleasure and emotional satisfaction, said researchers from Louisiana State University, Florida State University and Baylor University. \n \n Their study -- ""Marital Characteristics and the Sexual Relationships of U.S. Older Adults: An Analysis of National Social Life, Health and Aging Project Data"" -- is published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, the official publication of the International Academy of Sex Research. \n \n Researchers analyzed the relationship between marital characteristics and sexual outcomes among 1,656 married adults ages 57-85, using data from the first wave of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project. They noted that people who survive until their 50th year of marriage -- among whom the slight rebound occurred -- are relatively few in number. \n \n ""Additionally, the study used a snapshot in time -- and therefore cannot prove that length and order of marriage caused sexual frequency,"" said former Baylor researcher Samuel Stroope, Ph.D., now an assistant professor of sociology at Louisiana State University. \n \n Nevertheless, the study provided ""intriguing results"" for one of the fastest growing age groups in the United States -- and one whose sexual behavior rarely has been studied, he said. \n \n One uncertainty that could be the subject of future research is the ""why"" of the findings. While sex becomes less of a novelty over time and frequency tends to diminish, ""it may be that the permanency of the relationship contributes to sexual relations picking up a bit at the end,"" Stroope said. \n \n ""Growing old as a couple, with the experience and knowledge that come with that, may play a part,"" he said. ""You are able to learn about your partner and build on that over time. You may have a higher level of trust when you feel that your spouse isn\'t going to go anywhere. The expectation that the relationship will continue may give you more reason to invest in the relationship -- including in sexual aspects of the relationship."" \n \n As to why ""remarrieds"" have less frequent sex than those in first marriages, ""it may be that those who have been married in the past may not have as strong of a sense of permanence or lasting investment,"" Stroope said. \n \n Michael McFarland, Ph.D., assistant professor of sociology and public health at Florida State University, was a study co-author. Researcher Jeremy Uecker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of sociology at Baylor and also a co-author, noted that ""we know a great deal about sexual behavior at younger stages of the life course. This study adds to a small but growing body of research on the sexual behavior of older adults."" \n \n Added Stroope: ""As people age, they tend to be more even-keeled, which may help cut down on marital conflict and facilitate regular sexual activity into advanced age."" \n \n The findings may surprise some in a society in which youth is the ideal and older adults are often subjected to ageism, researchers say. Despite stereotypes, the study joins other research in revealing that regular sexual activity remains a part of many older adults\' lives -- even with declining health and the death of a spouse on the horizon. \n \n ###']",3,"– Say hello to your great-great-great-great-great-grandparents (times a few million or so)—Protungulatum donnae, a rat-sized insect eater believed to have lived 66 million years ago. A new six-year study of the mammalian family tree, looking at DNA and anatomical evidence in greater detail than ever before, has identified Protungulatum donnae as the most likely common ancestor for all 5,400 placental mammal species, reports the New York Times. The critter, however, is only hypothetical, notes the LA Times, explaining that scientists used data to ""reverse-engineer"" it. The study examined 83 mammals and fossils for more than 4,500 traits, creating a database 10 times larger than any previous database. Because Protungulatum donnae would have emerged 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great extinction that ended the dinosaurs—about 36 million years later than previous estimates—scientists say this is a clear sign the rise of the mammals was tied to that mass extinction.

75,"['In a rapid series of progressively escalating press releases by the Illinois Department of Public Health, it appears that a dangerous synthetic cannabinoid product called K2, spice, synthetic marijuana, legal weed or fake weed has now claimed its latest victim in an outbreak currently totaling 38 people whose severe bleeding is linked to exposure of this substance. The state division just announced the first death in this cluster. Over recent days, the toll of those harmed continues to increase with all being hospitalized for spontaneous excessive bleeding, including but not limited to coughing up blood, urinating blood, bloody stools, bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose and gums. \n \n Illinois government officials warn that these items were sold by convenience stores and dealers or obtained from friends. They have issued this advisory: \n \n “If you have purchased any of this product in the past month, do not use it. If you have used any of these products, and start experiencing severe, unexplained bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to the hospital immediately or call 911. Do not walk or drive yourself. Tell your health care providers about the possible link between your symptoms and synthetic cannabinoid use.” \n \n What are synthetic cannabinoids? \n \n The agency goes on to inform about the varying misperceptions people have with respect to synthetic cannabinoids and their falsely perceived safety. As per their description, they are human-made, unregulated mind-altering chemicals that fall under a drug category called new psychoactive substances (NPS). These substances are sprayed on dried plant material for smoking or sold in liquid form to be used in vaporizing devices. \n \n They are sold and used recreationally under many names (e.g. herbal or liquid incense, K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Genie, Zohai, among others). Often pitched as being able to mimic the effects of cannabis because the chemical makeup is similar to those in the marijuana plant, the marketing of synthetic cannabinoids as synthetic “pot” can be deceptive and untrue. Synthetic cannabinoids have been found to impact the brain with greater potency, be volatile and life-threatening. \n \n What is causing the internal bleeding (and now death) in Illinois? \n \n According to the Chicago Tribune, \n \n “Consumption of synthetic cannabinoids previously has caused serious health problems such as seizures and kidney failure, but the side effect of severe bleeding is tied to the recent outbreak, said Dr. Patrick Lank, a medical toxicologist who works at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.” The article goes on to reveal “three of the hospitalized people tested positive for brodifacoum, more commonly known as rat poison.” \n \n You may be familiar with the drug coumadin - a blood thinning medication used to treat clots and prevent stroke - whose generic name is warfarin. Brodifacoum is often called a “superwarfarin” because it is extremely powerful with a long duration of action. \n \n Rat poison notoriously contains ingredients that have anticoagulant properties - or substances that impede someone’s ability to clot effectively. This particular compound antagonizes Vitamin K (which is necessary for proper clotting) and has an especially long half-life, so treatment for poisonings requires high doses at regular, continuous intervals for protracted periods of time. Over-the-counter options are not good enough given the severity of the problem and the urgency needed to correct it. And, therapies are mostly helpful when initiated before extensive bleeding and blood loss takes place. \n \n Once someone loses their ability to clot a cascade of untoward events follows. With such internal bleeding and blood loss, a person can go into shock, suffer a stroke, cardiac events, loss of consciousness and death. \n \n The bottom line… \n \n Efforts to liken synthetic cannabinoids to the active ingredient in marijuana by calling the products synthetic “pot” or “marijuana” are misleading misnomers. These “products” contain many highly potent, dangerous chemicals and you are taking big risks when using them. \n \n ADDENDUM (4/2/18, 8pm) \n \n The Illinois Department of Public Health now reports 2 deaths, 56 cases and expects these numbers to rise. See their link here for daily updates on this outbreak.', 'A woman from central Illinois has become the fourth person in the state to die from synthetic marijuana, officials announced Tuesday. \n \n The woman, whose name was not disclosed, was in her 30s, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported. \n \n Previously, two men, one in his 20s and another in his 40s, died in central Illinois, along with a Chicago-area man in his 20s. \n \n Health officials reported that 153 people in 13 counties in Illinois have gotten sick from synthetic cannabinoids believed to be laced with rat poison. Most victims are from the Chicago and Peoria areas. \n \n Synthetic marijuana is not marijuana at all but man-made chemicals sold on the premise that they act on the same brain cell receptors as the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, THC. \n \n In recent weeks, victims have begun showing up in hospital emergency rooms after coughing up blood, bleeding in the urine, nose or gums, or having internal bleeding, officials said. It was determined that they were suffering from a chemical found in rat poison called brodifacoum, which prevents blood from clotting. Officials said the poison is believed to have been mixed in with the synthetic marijuana. \n \n Patients are treated with intravenous transfusions of vitamin K to restore their blood’s clotting ability, followed by vitamin K pills.

""If you know someone who uses synthetic cannabinoids, tell them these are deadly products and try to help them get treatment."" \n \n The US Attorney\'s Office charged three men with federal drug offenses and accused them of conspiring to sell synthetic cannabinoids at a Chicago convenience store, in connection with some of the cases. \n \n JUST WATCHED Police: Spike in synthetic marijuana overdoses in 2015 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police: Spike in synthetic marijuana overdoses in 2015 02:13 \n \n Synthetic cannabinoids are human-made chemicals that can be sprinkled on dried, shredded plant material and smoked or consumed as vaporized liquids inhaled through an e-cigarette or other device. \n \n Although these mind-altering chemicals are called cannabinoids, since they are designed to be similar to the chemicals found in marijuana, their actual impacts on the brain and body are much more powerful. They can cause serious side effects that are different from those of marijuana. \n \n One study of a synthetic cannabinoid, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2016, found that it was 85 times as potent as tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the mind-altering chemical in marijuana. \n \n Since the synthetic cannabinoids in Illinois were found to contain rat poison, most of the hospitalizations have been related to unexplained bleeding, such as coughing up blood, blood in the urine, bloody nose and bleeding gums. \n \n A chemical in rat poison prevents blood from clotting, causing the severe bleeding, according to the state health department. \n \n Health officials warn that anyone who has a reaction to synthetic cannabinoids, such as severe bleeding, should call 911 or be taken to an emergency department immediately. \n \n To treat the bleeding, doctors use high doses of vitamin K, up to 30 tablets a day for up to six months, which can help restore the blood\'s ability to clot. \n \n Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n Since this rising number of cases calls for a large amount of vitamin K and long duration of treatment -- costing up to thousands of dollars for each patient -- the Illinois Department of Public Health announced that it\'s working to find a way to place no financial burden on patients tied to the synthetic cannabinoids outbreak. \n \n The Bausch Foundation, the charitable organization of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, donated nearly 800,000 tablets of vitamin K to the department.']",3,"– Another person in Illinois has died after using synthetic marijuana, reports the Chicago Tribune. The central Illinois woman, who was in her 30s, is the fourth person to die in the state after apparent use of the tainted substance. She's the third central Illinois victim; the fourth was from Chicago. In the last few weeks, more than 150 people across 13 counties have been hospitalized after using synthetic pot laced with what health officials believe to be a type of a rat poison known as brodifacoum, a powerful anti-coagulant. A widely used pesticide, when ingested by humans brodifacoum can cause bleeding from the nose or gums, as well as internal bleeding. Symptoms include coughing up blood and bloody urine, health officials say, and brodifacoum poisoning can be treated with vitamin K administered via IV to stabilize the blood’s clotting ability. The treatment is effective if initiated before excessive bleeding occurs, per the American Council on Science and Health. CNN reports health officials urge anyone who has a reaction to synthetic marijuana to call 911 or go to an emergency room."

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press) \n \n Obama spoke not long after Boehner\'s office issued a statement that insisted the two sides remained far apart and that Republicans had never, as the White House contends, agreed on $33 billion in cuts to the federal spending allotment for the remaining six months of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. \n \n Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Boehner and Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid met in the White House Tuesday as the clock ticked toward a midnight Friday expiration of the government\'s spending authority. \n \n ""We are closer than we have ever been to an agreement. There is no reason why we should not get an agreement,"" Obama said in a surprise appearance in the White House reporters briefing room. \n \n The president said Boehner and Reid were meeting later Tuesday, but if that session produced no agreement he would summon both men back to the White House Wednesday and daily thereafter, if necessary. \n \n ""Myself, Joe Biden, my team we are prepared to meet for as long as possible to get this resolved,"" Obama said. \n \n Obama had barely finished speaking when Boehner strode before microphones to insist that the White House and Senate Democrats bow to demands for deeper cuts. Boehner is under extreme pressure from newly elected House members, many with allegiance to the ultraconservative tea party, to slash spending, the size of government and lower taxes. \n \n Short of a long-term deal, Boehner has proposed an agreement that would keep the government running for one more week and cut another $12 billion in spending. Boehner has already orchestrated action by Congress to pass a pair of stopgap bills, so far cutting $10 billion from an estimated $1.2 trillion budget to fund the day-to-day operations of government through the fiscal accounting period. \n \n Obama said he would only accept another short-term funding extension, of two or three days, to get a longer-term deal through Congress. But he ruled out a longer extension to allow negotiations to continue. \n \n ""That is not a way to run a government. I cannot have our agencies making plans based on two week budgets,"" Obama said. ""What we are not going to do is once again put off something that should have been done months ago."" \n \n Boehner said Republicans ""will not be put in a box"" of accepting options they refuse to endorse. \n \n Democrats accuse Republicans of pushing for harmful spending cuts and attaching a social policy agenda to the must-pass spending bill. Boehner counters that the White House is pressing gimmicky budget cuts. \n \n As a government shutdown appeared increasingly inevitable, the White House has begun advising government agencies on the proper steps in preparation for a shutdown of the government. Republicans on Monday disclosed plans to instruct lawmakers ""on how the House would operate in the event Senate Democrats shut down the government."" \n \n And in a memo to agency officials, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeffrey Zients, urged agency heads to refine and update contingency plans in the event negotiators don\'t strike a deal by Friday\'s deadline. \n \n Boehner\'s one-week plan could reassure tea party-backed lawmakers who are among the most vocal in seeking to reduce the size and scope of the government. It could also put pressure on Democrats and the White House to offer greater spending cuts. \n \n But there\'s no visible movement on an impasse over Republican policy riders attacking Obama\'s health care and financial reform laws, cutting taxpayer funds to Planned Parenthood and reversing a host of Obama\'s environmental policies. \n \n On a separate long-term track, Republicans controlling the House have fashioned plans to slash the budget deficit by more than $5 trillion over the upcoming decade, combining unprecedented spending cuts with a fundamental restructuring of taxpayer-financed health care for the elderly and the poor. \n \n House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan unveiled the Republican budget blueprint Tuesday morning just as Boehner headed to the White House. \n \n Ryan\'s program includes a controversial proposal to convert the traditional Medicare health care program for the aged into a system by which private insurers would operate plans approved by the federal government. \n \n Current Medicare beneficiaries or workers age 55 and older would stay in the existing system. \n \n At the same time, Republicans propose to sharply cut projected spending on the Medicaid state-federal health program for the poor and disabled and transform it into a block grant program that gives governors far less money than under current estimates, but considerably more flexibility.']",2,"– President Obama sounded like an impatient parent today as the threat of a government shutdown grew larger. Admonishing lawmakers to ""act like grownups,"" the president said John Boehner and Harry Reid would meet again later this afternoon, reports Politico. If nothing comes of it, Obama said he'll order them back at it again tomorrow. ""We are closer than we have ever been to an agreement,"" said Obama. ""There is no reason why we should not get an agreement."" Boehner spoke immediately afterward, notes AP, and said Republicans would continue to ""fight for the largest cuts possible."" It's possible another stopgap spending measure can keep government open if no deal is in place by Friday, but the president said he will accept one only if it's good for just two or three days."

O\'Reilly asked. \n \n Williams, 56, responded that too much political correctness can get in the way of reality. \n \n ""I mean, look, Bill, I\'m not a bigot.

79,"[""LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May survived a confidence vote from her Conservative party on Wednesday, but more than a third of her lawmakers said she was no longer the right leader to implement Britain’s exit from the European Union. \n \n Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London, Britain, December 12, 2018. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS \n \n Britain’s March 29 exit has been plunged into crisis by parliamentary opposition to the divorce deal she struck with the EU last month, which has opened up possibilities including a delay to Brexit or even another referendum on membership. \n \n May on Monday cancelled a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, designed to maintain close future ties with the bloc and agreed after two years of negotiations, after it became clear she would lose it badly. \n \n Eurosceptic critics of the deal within her own party triggered a no-confidence vote in her leadership hours after she returned from talks with European leaders aimed at winning additional assurances about her deal. \n \n After two hours of voting in Committee Room 14 in the House of Commons, Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, said 200 Conservative lawmakers had voted in support of May as leader, and 117 against, indicating her party was bitterly divided over the direction of Brexit. \n \n Supporters said the result showed the party should now get behind her. But the hardline Brexit supporters who triggered the vote because they saw her deal as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum said she should now quit. \n \n “It is a terrible result for the prime minister,” Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of a hard Brexit faction in the party, told BBC Television. “The prime minister must realise that, under all constitutional norms, she ought to go and see the queen urgently and resign.” \n \n But May loyalist Chris Grayling, her transport minister, said the party had endorsed her “comfortably”. \n \n ENDANGERING BREXIT? \n \n May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had warned opponents of her withdrawal deal - struck after two years of negotiations - that if they toppled her, Brexit would be delayed or stopped. \n \n Shortly before the vote, May sought to win over wavering lawmakers by promising to step down before the 2022 election. \n \n Brexit is Britain’s most significant political and economic decision since World War Two. Pro-Europeans fear the departure will weaken the West as it grapples with the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. \n \n The outcome will shape Britain’s $2.8 trillion economy, have far-reaching consequences for the unity of the kingdom and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centres. \n \n Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy, but say it will prosper in the long term when cut free from the EU, which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. \n \n May, 62, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum, where Britons decided by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU. She promised to implement Brexit while keeping close ties to the bloc, to heal a divided nation. \n \n Sterling jumped as high as $1.2672 GBP=D3 as the result came in but then fell to $1.2605, still up 1 percent on the day, after it emerged that the number of lawmakers who had voted against May was higher than many in the markets had expected."", 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May smiles at gathered journalists as she awaits the result \n \n Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader. \n \n The UK prime minister made a last-minute appeal for support at an emotional meeting of backbench MPs. \n \n She told them she will not lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022 - but wants to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal, MPs said. \n \n She faces a vote of confidence in her leadership after 48 Conservative MPs called for one to be held. \n \n The majority of Conservative MPs have publicly said they will support the PM but it is a secret ballot and there were signs of nerves among party managers ahead of the vote in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster. \n \n Voting finished at 20:00 with the result expected within the next hour. \n \n The prime minister was greeted with applause, and the traditional banging of desks, as she went in to the committee room to address her MPs. Some of them were reported to be in tears. \n \n She is understood to have promised not to call a ""snap general election"" and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election, partly because of what had happened at last year\'s election, when she lost her majority. \n \n But, she added: ""I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election."" \n \n Cabinet minister Amber Rudd said ""she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022"". \n \n But Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May, said she had received a ""half-hearted"" reception from MPs. \n \n She had said it was not her ""intention"" to fight the next election, added Mr Rees-Mogg, which he said was a ""politician\'s word"". \n \n Marcus Fysh, who also submitted a no confidence letter, said Mrs May ""didn\'t really have anything new to say"" about Brexit. \n \n She vowed to involve more people in developing policy, the MP told BBC News, but he did not think that would happen. \n \n And he predicted that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote of all MPs - not just Conservative ones - when she tried to get her Brexit deal through the Commons. \n \n ""Whatever happens tonight I don\'t think she will be able to command the confidence of the House for the type of Brexit she is trying to pursue."" \n \n Minister Margot James said she was ""proud"" to have voted for the PM, tweeting a picture of her ballot paper. \n \n Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months. \n \n That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through. \n \n Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack. \n \n The parliamentary sums don\'t change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won\'t give their backing. \n \n Read Laura\'s blog \n \n Can she survive the confidence vote? \n \n Immediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors. \n \n Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was ""the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29"", while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would ""flush out the extremists"" in his party whose Brexit agenda was ""not in the interests of the British people"". \n \n So far, 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her, with 34 publicly against, according to BBC research.

The prime minister has negotiated her deal. She has told us it is the best and only deal available. \n \n ""There can be no more excuses, no more running away.

But our party will rightly not tolerate it. \n \n ""Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May\'s leadership. In the national interest, she must go."" \n \n And Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who he said had lost faith in Mrs May. \n \n Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who is campaigning for a further referendum, told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg\'s group would ""get a kicking"" in the vote and that their ""pompous gesturing"" will be exposed. \n \n Why are they trying to get rid of her? \n \n They don\'t like the deal she has struck with the EU, which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world. \n \n Anger has focused on the so-called ""backstop"" to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland. \n \n Mrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be ""temporary"" but the Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to win key votes, wants the backstop to be ditched altogether. \n \n And her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated. \n \n Who are the frontrunners to lead the party if she loses? \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd \n \n There are many names being floated, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd among cabinet ministers rated by the bookmakers. \n \n Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running. \n \n But, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, the field of hopefuls could be much larger and, initially at least, resemble the start of a Grand National. \n \n What does it mean for Brexit? \n \n Whatever the outcome of the vote, Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday\'s summit of EU leaders, although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership. \n \n She has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to ""adopt relevant conclusions"". \n \n European Council President Donald Tusk has said the ""seriousness"" of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning. \n \n Mrs May met Germany\'s Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament. \n \n But she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, among others, on Wednesday to fight for her leadership. \n \n Mrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs - many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum. \n \n Many of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms, without a deal. They say warnings of economic doom are exaggerated.', '19:29 \n \n What about the ‘meaningful vote’? \n \n The result clearly highlights May’s essential Brexit problem. The number of rebels at 117 is eyecatchingly similar to the 100 or so MPs who were planning to vote against her Brexit deal before she postponed the vote a day before its scheduled date of Tuesday. \n \n It is a blocking minority preventing the current deal, or anything like it, from being ratified by parliament. To win round that amount of rebels, May has to make dramatic progress in her talks with Brussels and persuade the right of her party that she can “bin the backstop”. \n \n However, the European Union has made it repeatedly clear that the legally binding 585-page withdrawal agreement – which contains the Northern Irish backstop – is not up for renegotiation. And without renegotiation, the backstop will endure and Tory rebels will almost certainly not vote for it. \n \n No 10 has promised that the vote will happen before 21 January, which in negotiating terms is very little time at all.

Later, he added, “We’ve only had six tornado warnings.” Although there were laughs all around, would Bergeron panic if he woke up Monday morning for the actual show and saw a gray sky? \n \n [D.C.-area forecast: Rain likely for the Fourth, but not necessarily a total washout all day and evening] \n \n Tom Bergeron, host of “A Capitol Fourth.” (Capital Concerts) \n \n “Oh, no,” he told us backstage.

He’s especially jazzed to meet Jackson, who plays George Washington in the smash musical “Hamilton”; Bergeron saw the show last month and loved it, although he quipped during rehearsal that he had to take out a second mortgage to afford tickets. \n \n And is Bergeron especially eager to have the best seat in the house for the fireworks, with his prime perch on the West Lawn? \n \n “To be honest with you, the fireworks — even though that gets such attention — is the least interesting part of it to me.

(Bill O’Leary /The Washington Post) \n \n On the morning after Donald Trump’s inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael T. Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him. \n \n In a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day’s crowds on the Mall, according to three individuals who have knowledge of the conversation. The president believed that the photos might prove that the media had lied in reporting that attendance had been no better than average. \n \n Trump also expressed anger over a retweet sent from the agency’s account, in which side-by-side photographs showed far fewer people at his swearing-in than had shown up to see Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009. \n \n According to one account, Reynolds had been contacted by the White House and given a phone number to call. When he dialed it, he was told to hold for the president. \n \n For Trump, who sees himself and his achievements in superlative terms, the inauguration’s crowd size has been a source of grievance that he appears unable to put behind him. It is a measure of his fixation on the issue that he would devote part of his first morning in office to it — and that he would take out his frustrations on an acting Park Service director. \n \n (The Washington Post) \n \n Word rapidly spread through the agency and Washington. The individuals who informed The Washington Post about the call did so on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the conversation. \n \n Neither Reynolds nor the Park Service would talk about it. \n \n “The National Park Service does not comment on internal conversations among administration officials,” agency spokesman Thomas Crosson said. \n \n White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the call simply demonstrated that Trump’s management style is to be “so accessible, and constantly in touch.” \n \n “He’s not somebody who sits around and waits. He takes action and gets things done,” Sanders said. “That’s one of the reasons that he is president today, and Hillary Clinton isn’t.” \n \n On Saturday, the same day Trump spoke with Reynolds, the new president used an appearance at CIA headquarters to deliver a blistering attack on the media for reporting that large swaths of the Mall were nearly empty during the event. \n \n “It’s a lie,” Trump said. “We caught [the media].

Experts, however, have estimated that the 2017 turnout was no more than a third the size of Obama’s eight years earlier. \n \n Reynolds was taken aback by Trump’s request, but he did secure some additional aerial photographs and forwarded them to the White House through normal channels in the Interior Department, the people who notified The Post said. The photos, however, did not prove Trump’s contention that the crowd size was upward of 1 million. \n \n Reynolds, who had served as the Park Service’s deputy director of operations for six months before assuming the post of acting director, is a third-generation employee who has worked there for more than 30 years. As deputy director, he oversaw the Park Service’s $2.8 billion budget and more than 22,000 employees. \n \n In the days since Trump’s election, the Park Service has become an unlikely protagonist in a battle between the new president and some career government employees. \n \n The trouble began late Friday, when the agency’s official Twitter account retweeted two messages that could be perceived as critical of the new administration: the one comparing the relative crowd size for Trump’s inauguration to that of Obama’s 2009 swearing-in, and another that noted policy pages that had been removed from the White House’s website. \n \n That prompted an “urgent directive” to Interior employees that they “shut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice,” which was lifted early Saturday morning. Crosson then apologized on Twitter for “mistaken RTs from our account.” \n \n On Tuesday, the Badlands National Park’s Twitter account became a social-media sensation when it posted four tweets in a row about rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and the threats posed by climate change. \n \n Those tweets were then deleted. An NPS official later explained that Badlands NPS officials learned they were posted by a former employee who still had access to the account, and decided to remove them. \n \n [Interior Department reactivates Twitter accounts after shutdown following inauguration] \n \n Spicer told reporters this week that White House officials had not dictated any agency to impose new restrictions on public communications and that some federal officials, such as those at the Park Service, were not in compliance with their own department’s policies. \n \n Trump, meanwhile, has continued to press the argument that the media has given a misleading account of the crowds that attended his inauguration. \n \n “I had a massive amount of people here,” the president told ABC News anchor David Muir in an interview Wednesday. “They were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering — from certain angles — that were taken early and lots of other things.” \n \n As he guided Muir through the West Wing, Trump paused at a photo on the wall, taken from behind him as he delivered his inaugural address: “Here’s a picture of the event. Here’s a picture of the crowd. Now, the audience was the biggest ever, but this crowd was massive. Look how far back it goes. This crowd was massive.” \n \n Brady Dennis and Lisa Rein contributed to this report.']",2,"– President Trump may not have had the biggest inauguration crowd in history, but he may have made a bigger fuss about media coverage of it than any of his predecessors.

Reynolds, who has worked for the service for 30 years, was ""taken aback"" by the request, but he sent some aerial photos to Trump, according to the Post's sources. The photos did not, however, provide proof of Trump's claim that more than a million people had gathered to watch his inauguration. Reynolds and the NPS have declined to comment, but insiders say Trump also expressed anger over an NPS tweet comparing his crowd to Obama's, which apparently led to an order for all Interior Department accounts to stop tweeting.

(Associated Press) \n \n The State Employees\' Retirement System notified Sandusky by letter that his crimes triggered forfeiture of his pension. The former Penn State assistant football coach was sentenced Tuesday to at least 30 years in prison for molesting 10 boys. \n \n The retirement system told Sandusky he will no longer receive his $4,908 monthly annuity and informed his wife, Dottie, she is no longer entitled to a survivor\'s benefit. \n \n Sandusky\'s lawyer, Karl Rominger, contended the agency has no legal grounds for revoking the pension and said Sandusky will fight any attempt to do so. \n \n ""It\'s my inclination to believe that they are just going through the motions to try to throw some red meat to the public, but they know they are going to lose,"" Rominger said. \n \n Pennsylvania\'s pension forfeiture law, originally passed in 1978, primarily applies to public employees convicted of a financial crime related to the office ""or when his public employment places him in a position to commit the crime."" \n \n Since 2004, it has also applied to any public school employee convicted of a sex crime against a student. \n \n In its letter to Sandusky, the retirement system said it had determined that two of the criminal charges of which Sandusky was convicted _ involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault _ fell under the forfeiture law. \n \n It also said Sandusky maintained extensive ties to Penn State after his 1999 retirement, qualifying him as a ""de facto"" employee subject to forfeiture for crimes committed even when he was no longer on the university\'s payroll. \n \n SERS\' letter to Sandusky was released to The Associated Press in response to an open-records request. \n \n Rominger argued in part that since Sandusky wasn\'t convicted of molesting a Penn State student, the forfeiture law does not apply to him. Sandusky\'s young victims came to him through The Second Mile, his charity for troubled youth. \n \n ""It did not involve students where he worked, and that\'s going to be the crux,"" Rominger said. \n \n But Philadelphia attorney Alaine Williams, an expert on public employee labor law, said courts have broadly construed the forfeiture law. \n \n ""I think he\'s got a very serious problem,"" she said ahead of the retirement system\'s announcement. \n \n Sandusky entered the State Employees\' Retirement System when he began working as a Penn State football coach in 1969. He collected a $148,000 lump sum payment when he retired from the university in 1999, and began receiving a monthly annuity, according to records provided by SERS. Sandusky received a total of $900,000 in pension payments between 1999 and September 2012. \n \n The forfeiture statute permits an employee to keep his or her contributions without interest, minus any fees or restitution association with the employee\'s conviction. Employees subject to forfeiture can appeal to the board of the State Employees\' Retirement System, then through the state court system.', 'Story highlights In letters to judge, Sanduskys portray themselves as virtuous victims \n \n The letters all but guaranteed a maximum punishment, legal observers say \n \n ""Sentencing is a time to ask for mercy, not to attack others,"" one expert says \n \n Adopted Sandusky son disappointed by his parents\' smearing of his character, lawyers say \n \n When all was said and done, Jerry and Dottie Sandusky did not ask the judge for mercy. They did not try to extol Jerry\'s virtues, list good deeds or express regret. Instead, they depicted the boys he sexually assaulted as ungrateful and called them liars. \n \n They blamed the young men -- including their own adopted son, Matt, who now claims he, too, was molested -- for their downfall. \n \n In letters to the judge who would sentence the former coach, the Sanduskys portrayed themselves as virtuous victims of a vast conspiracy.

Judge John Cleland and the Centre County courts made them public, and CNN obtained copies. \n \n In them, Jerry Sandusky expressed little sympathy for the 10 boys he was convicted of molesting. As he wrote about their families, he tried to shift the blame, pointing out that the boys came from unstable homes. \n \n ""Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this,"" he wrote. He said nothing about the damaged lives and institutions his molestation case left in its wake. \n \n Read the letters (.PDF) \n \n Instead, both Sanduskys wrote that the justice system let them down. \n \n Just as letters to one of the boys he was accused of molesting helped secure his conviction, the letters to the judge all but guaranteed a maximum punishment, legal observers say. \n \n Cleland, who presided over the trial and sentenced Sandusky on Tuesday to 30 to 60 years in prison, noted that others wrote letters as well. But he indicated that he considered only the Sanduskys\' letters in handing down a sentence that, for a 68-year-old man, is likely to be a life prison term. \n \n Victim to Sandusky: \'Because of you, I trust no one\' \n \n ""Sentencing is a time to ask for mercy, not to attack others,"" said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who teaches legal ethics at Loyola Law School. ""In my experience, judges really hate letters that try to shift the blame to others or which belittle the victims or the court."" \n \n B.J. Bernstein, an Atlanta attorney who comments on legal matters for CNN, agreed that Sandusky didn\'t do himself any favors. \n \n ""The old adage \'if you can\'t say something nice, don\'t say anything at all\' applies to sentencing statements,"" Bernstein said. ""It is awkward when you deny you are culpable and a jury says otherwise. For appellate purposes Sandusky was never going to accept responsibility or admit doing something wrong, but lashing out at everyone so strongly was irrational."" \n \n She added that Sandusky might have thought he was still playing to his Penn State fan base, but it backfired. \n \n ""Between Jerry and Dottie\'s vicious protestations of innocence,"" Bernstein said, ""all I can think is the victims -- and in particular their son Matt -- should shout back the lyrics from the Eric Clapton song, \'Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.\'"" \n \n Sandusky\'s son comes forward as victim \n \n Jerry Sandusky bashed victims and laid out the conspiracy theory in a pre-recorded interview leaked to a campus radio station on the eve of his sentencing. He hinted at it again when he spoke in court on Tuesday, after being warned by his lawyers to avoid criticizing his victims or the justice system. \n \n His performances on air and in the courtroom were widely derided by prosecutors, legal analysts and commentators as narcissistic, self-absorbed and even more hurtful to the young men he was convicted of molesting. \n \n Jerry Sandusky\'s letter expanded on the rambling, 15-minute courtroom soliloquy that touched on everything from the writer Henry David Thoreau to ""special inmate friends"" to wet kisses from dogs. Like that speech, it was part locker room pep talk and part Sunday school inspirational, with a heaping side order of the Frank Sinatra ballad ""My Way."" \n \n He wrote about life in protective custody, and how it led him to think about all the interests that were being protected as the case unfolded: ""The system protected the system, the media, the prosecution, the civil attorneys and the accusers. Everybody protected themselves,"" he wrote. \n \n ""Penn State, with its own system, protected their public image,"" he continued. ""Media protected their jobs and ambitions. Prosecutors protected their jobs and egos. The accusers were protected and provided access to potential financial gain, free attorneys, accolades, psychologists and attention."" \n \n McQueary files lawsuit against Penn State \n \n He wrote that he was heartbroken. \n \n ""My trust in people, systems and fairness has diminished,"" he said. ""In my heart I know I did not do these disgusting acts. However, I didn\'t tell the jury. Our son changed our plans when he switched sides."" \n \n Matt Sandusky was 18 when he was adopted by the Sanduskys after spending time with them in foster care. The relationship always has been rocky, but it collapsed near the end of Sandusky\'s trial in June. As the prosecution\'s case drew to a close, Matt told investigators that Sandusky had molested him, too. \n \n Matt Sandusky, now 33, did not testify for either side, but Jerry Sandusky insists that his adopted son\'s desertion and potentially damaging testimony kept him from testifying in his own defense. \n \n The Sanduskys spared no one. \n \n ""There were so many people involved in the orchestration of this conviction (media, investigators, prosecutors, ""the system,"" Penn State and the accusers.) It was well done. They won!"" Jerry Sandusky wrote, as if a tragic court case about molested children was an epic gridiron contest. \n \n ""When I thought about how it had transpired, I wondered what they had won,"" he continued. ""I thought of the methods, decisions and allegations. I relived the inconsistencies and dishonest testimonies."" He pondered what would happen if the tables were turned. \n \n When the hero falls off the pedestal: The emotion of betrayal \n \n ""What would be the outcome if all the accusers and their families who were investigated?"" he wrote. ""I knew the answer. All their issues would surface. They would no longer be these poor, innocent people as portrayed."" \n \n Dottie Sandusky also wrote of her disappointment, saying she has lost faith in the police and the legal system. ""To think that they can lie and get by with the lies. The press has been unbelievable. People who have not met us are writing untruths."" \n \n Dottie Sandusky\'s letter is revealing because she has stood silently by her husband in court. She testified at his trial that she never heard or saw anything strange or sexual going on in the basement of their home, where many of the victims say her husband molested them. \n \n In her letter, she unloaded on her adopted son, Matt. \n \n ""People need to know what kind of person he is,"" she wrote. ""We have forgiven him many times for all he has done to our family, thinking that he was changing his life, but he would always go back to his stealing and lies. He has been diagnose (sic) Bipolar, but he refuses to take his medicine."" \n \n Records from Centre County\'s probation department and juvenile courts tell part of the story of how Matt H., as he was known, came to the Sanduskys. \n \n Like the boys who testified against Sandusky at the trial, Matt participated in Sandusky\'s youth mentoring program, The Second Mile. Jerry Sandusky was in Southern California, preparing for the Rose Bowl, when Matt was arrested in 1995. Sandusky called personally and pulled strings to make sure Matt was placed under his care and not sent to juvenile detention. \n \n Opinion: For the victims, it\'s about more than locking him up \n \n The court documents detail Matt\'s continuing troubles, including an aspirin overdose in March 1996 that is characterized as a suicide attempt. But he maintained that he wanted to stay in the Sandusky home, writing to the court, ""I feel that they have supported me even when I have messed up. They are a loving, caring group of people. They have showed me what a family is really like."" \n \n In another instance, Sandusky called police to his house, claiming a burglar was trying to break in. It was Matt, who said he had come to the house for a power tool. \n \n Matt Sandusky now is represented by a law firm in State College that is handling the cases of several other Sandusky molestation victims. \n \n ""Matt is extremely disappointed that Dottie and the Sanduskys have decided to smear his character in an attempt to deflect attention from Jerry Sandusky\'s heinous crimes,"" his lawyers Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin said in a written statement to CNN. \n \n ""Matt has shown tremendous courage and strength,"" the statement continued. ""Rather than supporting her son when he made the gut-wrenching decision to come forward and tell the truth about the abuse he suffered at the hands of Jerry Sandusky, Dottie Sandusky has chosen to continue Jerry\'s strategy of blaming and attacking the victims, thereby perpetuating the abuse."" \n \n Dottie Sandusky wrote that her adopted son ""has had many run-ins with the law and stolen money and items from our family. We still love him and want the best for him, but because of his actions we cannot express this to him. ..."" \n \n Karl Rominger, a lawyer for Sandusky, did not respond to a request for comment.

Jerry Brown campaigns on behalf of Proposition 30, his tax measure. The nonprofit Americans for Job Security donated $11 million to oppose the measure in what California authorities called ""campaign money laundering."" (Gary Friedman, Los Angeles Times / ) \n \n WASHINGTON — Tax-exempt advocacy groups that played an aggressive role in this year\'s election are coming under increasing scrutiny from state regulators, who are cracking down on organizations seeking to engage in campaigns without revealing their financial backers. \n \n The pressure in states with stringent campaign finance rules contrasts sharply with the federal level, where nonprofits that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to influence races this year have not been required to disclose their donors. \n \n This month, California\'s Fair Political Practices Commission forced an Arizona-based group to reveal the source of $11 million it gave for two ballot initiative campaigns. The funds were traced to a Virginia nonprofit that also does not reveal its donors. That hasn\'t satisfied the commission, which has begun an investigation to uncover the original source. \n \n Shortly before election day, judges in Idaho and Montana required the disclosure of contributors to two nonprofit organizations that had drawn the attention of state regulators with their political activity. \n \n ""Frankly, if we didn\'t take a stand on this, we might as well just pack up our campaign disclosure law and send it away,"" said Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa. ""The fact that federal campaign laws are deficient or you\'ve got a deadlocked Federal Election Commission — that doesn\'t mean the states are powerless."" \n \n Ysursa sued a group called Education Voters of Idaho, which gave more than $200,000 for ads backing three state ballot measures, accusing it of failing to comply with the state\'s sunshine law. After the court order, the organization revealed it had received money from New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Albertsons supermarket scion Joseph P. Scott, among others. \n \n The clashes between state elections officials and advocacy groups are a byproduct of the U.S. Supreme Court\'s 2010 ruling in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which lifted the ban on direct political expenditures by corporations. That triggered a surge of election activity by groups incorporated under the tax code\'s section 501(c)4 as social welfare organizations, which are allowed to engage in issue advocacy. \n \n At the federal level, political action committees are required to report their contributors, but so far the nonprofits are not. \n \n The Federal Election Commission, which has six members split evenly between the major parties, is frozen in partisan gridlock on questions regarding nonprofit activity. The Internal Revenue Service said this summer that it had begun examining some of the groups, but had yet to take any public action. And efforts to pass new disclosure laws have so far foundered in Congress. \n \n But the picture is different in many states, where lawmakers have toughened disclosure rules to require any organization making a political expenditure to report its financial backers. \n \n Disclosure opponents have systematically challenged the state measures in court, arguing that the Supreme Court has said a group must have politics as its ""major purpose"" in order to be considered a political committee. \n \n Advocates for more campaign finance reporting have countered — largely successfully — that the high court has repeatedly endorsed disclosure and has not limited it to political committees. \n \n ""If you look at the federal issue, you would be inclined to throw up your hands,"" said Derek Cressman, vice president for state operations at Common Cause, which advocates for more transparency. ""The progress that some states are making proves that these disclosure issues are problems we can solve."" \n \n Take the case of Americans for Job Security, a Virginia-based nonprofit that has been a serious political player for at least a dozen years, spending millions on ads without disclosing its backers. \n \n In 2008, the FEC\'s general counsel concluded the trade group met the definition of a political committee that is required to report its donors, and requested approval to pursue a formal investigation. But the commission deadlocked, and no action was taken. \n \n Early this month, Americans for Job Security played a role in one of California\'s most closely watched election-year dramas — unmasked as the source of an $11-million donation to oppose Gov. Jerry Brown\'s tax increase measure and support another measure intended to curb the ability of unions to raise money for political activity. \n \n The money had first been routed to an Arizona group called the Center to Protect Patient Rights, which sent it to another nonprofit also based in Arizona called Americans for Responsible Leadership, which in turn gave the money to the conservative Small Business Action Committee in California to run ads about the ballot measures. \n \n State authorities called it ""campaign money laundering."" \n \n Ann Ravel, chairwoman of the Fair Political Practices Commission, said the contribution may have violated a rule implemented in May to prevent donors from anonymously shuttling money through nonprofits with the intention of spending it on California campaigns. If found in violation, the nonprofits involved could face millions of dollars in fines. \n \n The Small Business Action Committee could also be forced to pay $11 million to the state\'s general fund if authorities prove it knowingly failed to report the original source of its funds, Ravel said. \n \n The committee and Americans for Responsible Leadership have denied breaking any rules. \n \n State Sen. Leland Yee (D-San Francisco) said he planned to introduce legislation that would require more complete disclosure. \n \n ""How can anyone allow organizations of whatever kind to come into this state and not disclose the true source of money?"" he said. \n \n A similar fight is playing out in Montana, where a group called American Tradition Partnership has been locked in a battle with the agency that enforces the state\'s campaign finance rule. \n \n In October 2010, Montana\'s commissioner of political practices concluded that the group\'s activities, which included sending mailers attacking Democratic and moderate Republican lawmakers, meant it had to file reports as a political committee. ATP sued, challenging the disclosure laws as unconstitutional and arguing that it is an educational group. \n \n ATP has remained active in state politics, sending out a mock newspaper this fall that featured gubernatorial candidate Steve Bullock, the state\'s attorney general, in a photo array of sex offenders as part of an article that slammed his handling of the state\'s sex offender database. \n \n The legal wrangling between state officials and ATP is ongoing, but has already pulled back the curtain on the group\'s contributors. Shortly before election day, the state judge hearing the case released a cache of the group\'s financial documents that state prosecutors had subpoenaed from Wells Fargo. The documents, which the PBS show ""Frontline"" and the investigative website ProPublica had requested, showed that ATP donors have included nonprofits linked to Republican activists in Colorado, as well as some major GOP donors. \n \n In Maine, state ethics officials are investigating the National Organization for Marriage, which has refused to release the names of donors that financed its efforts to defeat a 2009 measure to legalize same-sex marriage. \n \n The nonprofit groups under scrutiny say they are caught between conflicting state and federal regulations. \n \n John Foster, the Boise-based lobbyist and political consultant behind Education Voters of Idaho, said he set it up as a 501(c)4 because its activities fall squarely within the IRS definition of a social welfare organization. Donors gave money for education reform, not earmarked for political campaigns, he said, so the group should not have to reveal names. \n \n ""We are very proud of our donors, and the prospect of releasing them publicly was never an issue for us,"" Foster said. ""It was always about whether we get to decide who we are, or whether a state regulator gets to decide who we are."" \n \n ""The rules are not entirely clear,"" he added.

As in most other winter sports, the South is much stronger than the North. \n \n “Our players were really nervous,” Sarah Murray, South Korean women’s hockey head coach, told Reuters last month during the team’s training swing through the United States. \n \n “We can only take 23 players to the Olympics, and they thought these North Koreans are going to come in and take our spots”, Murray said. \n \n Chun, the South’s lead delegate, said the decision on a united ice hockey team is not yet finalised, as it requires the consent of the IOC and related international body. \n \n “We’re well aware of the people’s concerns and interests about this”, he told a news conference. \n \n “But I would like you to see the other side that it could make a positive contribution to peace of the Korean Peninsula and improving inter-Korean relations”. \n \n On Tuesday, the North said a 140-person orchestra would perform in South Korea during the Games. Pyongyang is also planning to send a large delegation in addition to the athletes and orchestra. \n \n Paik Hak-soon, the director of the Center for North Korean studies at Sejong Institute in South Korea, said North Korea was using the cheering squad to draw attention to its apparent cooperative spirit. \n \n “Seeing good results in competitions thanks to the cheering squad would enable the North Koreans to say they contributed to a successful Olympics and the South Korean government would likely agree,” said Paik. \n \n Slideshow (5 Images) \n \n “In the end, they are using this old tactic to get to Washington through Seoul.” \n \n Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Mosby remaining at the helm of the prosecution. \n \n During a day of hearings in a downtown courtroom, Judge Barry Williams swiftly sliced through complex legal arguments in the first motions hearing. In three key rulings issued from the bench, he refused to dismiss the charges or recuse Mosby and decided that the case should be split to ensure that each officer gets a fair trial. \n \n Williams said that trying the officers together would not be ""in the interest of justice"" because key evidence that\'s admissible with regards to one officer may be inadmissible for another. The officers are charged with a range of offenses, from murder to misconduct, as each played a different role in Gray\'s arrest and transport. \n \n The case has sparked widespread protests in Baltimore — which continued Wednesday — and has become part of a national dialogue about police treatment of black citizens. Gray, 25, died in April one week after suffering a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody. \n \n Outside the courtroom, dozens of protesters gathered in peaceful demonstrations and marches through downtown that resulted in one arrest and snarled traffic. Even at this early stage of the court proceedings, organizers said they wanted their voices heard. \n \n ""It\'s a step in the right direction,"" Malcolm Wilson said of Williams\' rulings on defense motions to recuse Mosby and dismiss the case. The 23-year-old East Baltimore resident, who said he knew Gray, clutched a white cardboard sign that read, ""I am here for Justice for Mr. Gray."" \n \n Police, who had been criticized for their response to previous demonstrations and rioting, repeatedly ordered protesters to ""remain on the sidewalk"" and quickly responded to one tense moment near the Inner Harbor in which a protester was arrested and an officer suffered minor injuries. \n \n Interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said police wanted to treat ""a protest like a protest,"" and that ""by and large, that\'s exactly what happened."" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake praised the department, saying she and police ""will vigorously defend the First Amendment rights of the protesters, but we will also vigorously enforce the order in our city."" \n \n In the courtroom, filled with legal observers and media after months of sharply written legal filings filled with accusations lobbed between the defense and prosecution, Williams sought to maintain order. \n \n He stopped the proceedings to remind those present to turn off all electronics, warning that he would remove everyone but the attorneys. He frequently interrupted the attorneys during their arguments, to seek clarification on a key point, wryly disagree or keep the attorneys on topic. \n \n The officers had waived their rights to attend Wednesday\'s hearing, and Gray\'s family did not attend. \n \n While the oral arguments on the dismissal and recusal motions largely reflected those made in written filings — which often centered on Mosby\'s actions — the arguments over whether to try the officers separately provided new insights into defense and prosecution theories. \n \n Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., the driver of the police van in which Gray was injured, is charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder. Sgt. Alicia D. White, Lt. Brian W. Rice and Officer William G. Porter are charged with manslaughter. Officers Edward M. Nero and Garrett E. Miller face lesser charges, including second-degree assault. All six have been charged with misconduct in office. \n \n Partially redacted statements by several of the officers were submitted to the court on Wednesday, though under seal, as were police dispatch tapes. \n \n Prosecutors previously indicated that they wanted to try Goodson, White, Nero and Miller together in one trial, and Porter and Rice together in a second trial. \n \n However, at the hearing Wednesday, they only sought to have Goodson, White and Nero tried together. Deputy State\'s Attorney Janice Bledsoe argued that much of the evidence in the case was relevant to those three officers. \n \n She said all of the evidence related to what happened to Gray from his arrest to his arrival unresponsive at the Western District police station would be needed to prove reckless endangerment on their part. \n \n But Marc Zayon, Nero\'s attorney, said Gray\'s arrest and transport constituted two separate incidents. He said evidence brought to support the felony charges against Goodson and White, including expert witness testimony on Gray\'s injuries sustained in the van and evidence regarding how Goodson was driving, would be highly prejudicial if introduced in a case against Nero. \n \n Defense attorneys also raised concerns that statements by the officers could incriminate one of the co-defendants, pitting one\'s right not to take the stand with another\'s right to confront his or her accuser. \n \n Matthew Fraling, an attorney for Goodson, also said he was concerned about a ""transfer of guilt"" and a ""spillover effect"" in the minds of jurors trying to categorize evidence against different defendants. \n \n In denying the state\'s motion to join the cases, Williams agreed that much of the evidence would not be ""mutually admissible."" His ruling means there will be six trials. \n \n Arguments over dismissing the charges and recusing Mosby came after a flurry of heatedly written motions over the past four months. In court Wednesday, Williams cautioned both sides to tone down their rhetoric. \n \n ""The unnecessary name calling and over-the-top rhetoric to which this court has been required to wade in order to get to the heart of the legal issues in this case is remarkable,"" Williams said.']",2,"– Written motions finally evolved into verbal arguments this morning in Baltimore, where defense attorneys for two of the six officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray tried to have said charges dismissed and the office of State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby recused from the case—attempts that were both rejected by Judge Barry Williams, the Baltimore Sun reports. The defense attorneys argued, among other things, that Mosby had influenced the jury pool by ""[adopting] and [encouraging] the public's cry of 'no justice, no peace'"" when she publicly announced the charges against the officers in May. Another complaint by the defense: Mosby's judgment was influenced by her husband serving as councilman for a local district that saw a ""disproportionate amount of violence"" in the days after Gray's death, the AP reports. Williams called that assertion ""condescending"" and said while he was ""troubled"" by some of Mosby's comments during her May 1 news conference, the defendants' right to a fair trial wasn't compromised by her statements, per the AP. The hearing is expected to continue this afternoon to determine whether the trial for the six officers should be split up. (In a unrelated story, members of Freddie Gray's family, including Gray himself, were victims of lead poisoning and may have been misled by a settlement company.)"

Sorvino was prompted to speak out after she alleged to reporter Ronan Farrow, who is Dylan’s brother, that Harvey Weinstein (who produced Mighty Aphrodite) harassed her years ago. \n \n “I confess that at the time I worked for Woody Allen I was a naïve young actress,” Sorvino wrote in an essay for HuffPost. “I swallowed the media’s portrayal of your abuse allegations against your father as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle between Mia Farrow and him, and did not look further into the situation, for which I am terribly sorry.” \n \n Sorvino stated clearly that her relationship with Allen on the film was “friendly, though not close, but in no way did he ever overstep his bounds with me.” \n \n “I never personally experienced what has now been described as inappropriate behavior toward young girls,” she said. “But this does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so.” \n \n The actress writes that she spoke with Ronan in December, telling about the “aftermath” of sharing her Weinstein story. In her accusations against Weinstein, she said that he essentially blacklisted her from landing plum movie roles after her Mighty Aphrodite success, because she reportedly rebuffed him when he sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship. (Weinstein denied the claims.) Her blacklisting allegations have been supported by directors like Peter Jackson and Terry Zwigoff; representatives for Weinstein released statements denying the claims from both directors. \n \n She also told Ronan that she wanted to learn more about Dylan’s accusations, and he pointed her toward “publicly available details of the case I had ruefully never known of, which made me begin to feel the evidence strongly supported your story.” \n \n “I am sorry it has taken me a few weeks to come out in support of you since that conversation, but it has been a process for me to own this truth and make this irrevocable break,” she writes. \n \n Sorvino is now the third actress to acknowledge Dylan Farrow and publicly distance herself from Woody Allen. Ellen Page, who starred in the 2012 Allen film To Rome with Love, kicked off the trend in November with a lengthy Facebook post. \n \n “I did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career,” she wrote. “I am ashamed I did this. I had yet to find my voice and was not who I am now and felt pressured, because ‘of course you have to say yes to this Woody Allen film.’ Ultimately, however, it is my choice what films I decide to do and I made the wrong choice. I made an awful mistake.” \n \n Greta Gerwig was the next to join this group, telling The New York Times that she will never work with Allen again. \n \n “Dylan Farrow’s two different pieces made me realize that I increased another woman’s pain, and I was heartbroken by that realization,” Gerwig said. “I grew up on his movies, and they have informed me as an artist, and I cannot change that fact now, but I can make different decisions moving forward.” \n \n Get Vanity Fair’s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

In the letter Sorvino writes that she regrets letting her admiration for the filmmaker’s work to influence her willingness to overlook Farrows claims for many years. \n \n Sorvino addressed Farrow directly, writing: \n \n I never personally experienced what has now been described as inappropriate behavior toward young girls. But this does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so. \n \n It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career’s existence. To decide, although they may be fantastically talented and helped you enormously, that you believe they have done things for which there can be no excuse. But that is where we stand today. \n \n In 1992, Dylan was 7 years old when she reportedly told her mother, Mia Farrow, that she was inappropriately sexually touched by Allen, Farrow’s partner of 12 years. Though Allen has denied the allegations and was not criminally charged, a judge granted Mia Farrow full custody after finding Dylan’s testimony credible in 1993. Dylan has maintained her allegations in recent essays. \n \n Sorvino explains in her letter that she had “cherished” Allen’s written work when she was a child and describes herself as being “in awe” of his films. She remembers herself in the mid ‘90s as a “naïve young actress” who accepted “the media’s portrayal of [Dylan’s] abuse allegations against [her] father as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle between Mia Farrow and him.” \n \n In the past year, Sorvino spoke to journalist Ronan Farrow, Dylan’s brother, on the record about her experience being sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein. Her allegations appeared in Ronan’s bombshell New Yorker exposé. In Sorvino’s letter she says that it was her experience with coming forward that made her to want to finally read more about Dylan’s experience. \n \n “I send you love and inclusion and admiration for your courage all this time. I believe you!!!” Sorvino wrote to Farrow. She added that she had no intention of defending Allen moving forward: \n \n Even if you love someone, if you learn they may have committed these despicable acts, they must be exposed and condemned, and this exposure must have consequences. I will never work with him again. \n \n In the past week, two other actors who worked with Allen, Greta Gerwig (To Rome With Love) and David Krumholtz (Wonder Wheel) have also expressed regret for working with the director.', 'Dear Dylan, \n \n Hello. I apologize for this being the first time I address you in print, what will be the first of several apologies today. I am writing to express my belief in and support of you. \n \n I confess that at the time I worked for Woody Allen I was a naive young actress. I swallowed the media’s portrayal of your abuse allegations against your father as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle between Mia Farrow and him, and did not look further into the situation, for which I am terribly sorry. For this I also owe an apology to Mia. \n \n What I have to say next is not a justification, simply a description of my background with Woody at that time and since. As an adolescent, I cherished my copy of his book “Without Feathers.” I played the Diane Keaton role in a high school production of “Play It Again, Sam” and had grown up, like so many in my generation, in awe of his films. As a young actress I landed the dream role of Linda Ash in “Mighty Aphrodite,” and the artistic license he allowed me to create the character was thrilling. We were friendly though not close, but in no way did he ever overstep his bounds with me; I never personally experienced what has now been described as inappropriate behavior toward young girls. But this does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so. \n \n It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career’s existence. To decide, although they may be fantastically talented and helped you enormously, that you believe they have done things for which there can be no excuse. But that is where we stand today. \n \n In December I called your brother Ronan, sharing about the aftermath of my and other women’s coming forward about Harvey Weinstein. How it had been a sometimes empowering, sometimes bitter and heartbreaking experience, as more and more details came out of hidden damage this man had done me. Of how I felt somehow more vulnerable and triggered (though certainly grateful) when millions of people showed me their support online, as though now my life had been reduced to one victimization... I told him I wanted to learn more about you and your situation. He pointed me toward publicly available details of the case I had ruefully never known of, which made me begin to feel the evidence strongly supported your story. That you have been telling the truth all along. \n \n I am so sorry, Dylan! I cannot begin to imagine how you have felt, all these years as you watched someone you called out as having hurt you as a child, a vulnerable little girl in his care, be lauded again and again, including by me and countless others in Hollywood who praised him and ignored you. As a mother and a woman, this breaks my heart for you. I am so, so sorry! \n \n We are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it. The cognitive dissonance, the denial and cowardice that spare us painful truths and prevent us from acting in defense of innocent victims while allowing “beloved” individuals to continue their heinous behavior must be jettisoned from the bottom of our souls. Even if you love someone, if you learn they may have committed these despicable acts, they must be exposed and condemned, and this exposure must have consequences. I will never work with him again. \n \n I am sorry it has taken me a few weeks to come out in support of you since that conversation, but it has been a process for me to own this truth and make this irrevocable break. \n \n I send you love and inclusion and admiration for your courage all this time. I believe you!!! I am grateful to you and admire your integrity and bravery, one woman who has had to stand virtually alone all these years speaking her painful truth. You are a true hero, and I stand with you. \n \n In gratitude and solidarity, \n \n Mira Sorvino']",3,"– ""I believe you!!!"" Mira Sorvino writes in an open letter to Dylan Farrow published by the HuffPost. The actor reached out to Woody Allen's daughter Wednesday to apologize for starring in her father's Mighty Aphrodite—for which she won an Oscar—while ignoring Farrow's claims of sexual abuse against Allen. Farrow was 7 when she said Allen sexually touched her, and a judge later found her claims credible, though Allen has continually denied the allegations, Vulture reports. Sorvino says she was aware of Farrow's claims when she made Mighty Aphrodite but dismissed them ""as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle"" because of her lifelong love of Allen's work. ""It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career’s existence,"" she writes. Sorvino says her experience opening up to Farrow's brother, reporter Ronan Farrow, about Harvey Weinstein made her want to learn more about Dylan Farrow's allegations, which led to her taking those allegations seriously. Sorvino says her love of Allen's work ""does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so."" She says she won't work with Allen again, writing: ""We are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it."" Sorvino isn't the first actor to denounce Allen. Greta Gerwig and David Krumholtz recently said they regret working with him.

Tsai... (Associated Press) \n \n The Democratic Progressive Party\'s Tsai was poised to become the self-governing island\'s first female president in an election taking place amid concerns that the island\'s economy is under threat from China and broad opposition to Beijing\'s demands for political unification. \n \n Tsai had about 60 percent of votes while Nationalist Eric Chu had about 30 percent, with about half of votes counted. \n \n ""We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn\'t work hard enough,"" Chu said before a thin crowd of a few hundred supporters at his campaign headquarters. He followed his concession speech by making a long bow. \n \n ""As the Nationalist Party chairperson, I need to pay the highest level of responsibility. Dear all friends, Eric Chu apologizes to everyone. I\'m resigning as party chief,"" he said. \n \n Outgoing Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has served eight years and is constitutionally barred from another term. \n \n The outcome of the contest for a majority in the 113-seat legislature remained uncertain, with independents and smaller parties posing a threat to both the Nationalists and the DPP. \n \n ""Taiwan and China need to keep some distance,"" said Willie Yao, a computer engineer voting in Taipei who said he backed Tsai. ""The change of president would mean still letting Taiwanese make the decision."" \n \n Reflecting unease over a slowdown in Taiwan\'s once-mighty economy, undeclared voter Hsieh Lee-fung said providing opportunities to the next generation was the most important issue. \n \n ""Economic progress is related closely to our leadership, like land reform and housing prices. People aren\'t making enough money to afford homes,"" Hsieh said. \n \n A win for Tsai would introduce new uncertainty in the complicated relationship between Taiwan and mainland China, which claims the island as its own territory and threatens to use force if it declares formal independence. \n \n ""This is not about defeating the other party. This is about working to overcome the obstacles in Taiwan\'s path,"" Tsai told supporters in the rain at a final rally Friday night in front of the presidential office building in the center of the capital, Taipei. \n \n Tsai has pledged to maintain the status quo of de-facto independence for the island of 23 million, although she has refused to endorse the principle that Taiwan and China are parts of a single nation to be unified eventually. \n \n Beijing has made that its baseline for continuing negotiations that have produced a series of pacts on trade, transport and exchanges. Observers say China is likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach to Tsai\'s presidency, but might use diplomatic and economy pressure if she is seen as straying too far from its unification agenda. \n \n Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1885 to 1945 and split again from China amid civil war in 1949. \n \n Chu was a late entry in the race after the party ditched its original candidate, Hung Hsiu-chu, whose abrasive style was seen as alienating voters. \n \n China has largely declined to comment on the polls, although its chief official for Taiwan affairs this month warned of potential major challenges in the relationship in the year ahead. \n \n Tsai supporters appeared confident that ties with China would weather a change in government. \n \n ""As long as Tsai doesn\'t provoke the other side, it\'s OK,"" said former newspaper distribution agent Lenex Chang, who attended Tsai\'s rally. ""If mainland China democratizes someday, we could consider a tie-up,"" he added. \n \n Candidates from across the political spectrum sounded a rare note of unity Saturday after a teenage pop star posted a video online apologizing for having waved the Taiwanese flag on a South Korean TV program. \n \n Sixteen-year-old Chou Tzu-yu, who performs under the name Tzuyu, had apparently been compelled to apologize after her South Korean management company suspended her activities in China for fear of offending nationalist sentiments on the mainland. \n \n Ma, Tsai and Chu all condemned what they described as the bullying of a young girl. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Ralph Jennings contributed to this report.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tsai Ing-wen said people in Taiwan wanted a transparent government \n \n Tsai Ing-wen has been elected Taiwan\'s first female president. \n \n Ms Tsai, 59, leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that wants independence from China. \n \n In her victory speech, she vowed to preserve the status quo in relations with China, adding Beijing must respect Taiwan\'s democracy and both sides must ensure there are no provocations. \n \n China sees the island as a breakaway province - which it has threatened to take back by force if necessary. \n \n In her speech, Ms Tsai hailed a ""new era"" in Taiwan and pledged to co-operate with other political parties on major issues. \n \n The will of the Taiwanese people would be the basis for relations with China, Ms Tsai said. \n \n ""I also want to emphasise that both sides of the Taiwanese Strait have a responsibility to find mutually acceptable means of interaction that are based on dignity and reciprocity. \n \n ""We must ensure that no provocations or accidents take place,"" Ms Tsai said, warning that ""any forms of suppression will harm the stability of cross-strait relations"". \n \n She thanked the US and Japan for their support and vowed Taiwan would contribute to peace and stability in the region. \n \n Ms Tsai had a commanding lead in the vote count when Eric Chu of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) admitted defeat. \n \n Mr Chu congratulated Tsai Ing-wen and announced he was quitting as KMT head.

Basically, they\'ve voted to keep Beijing at a distance. \n \n This reflects not only widespread dissatisfaction with President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT over insufficient measures to improve the lacklustre economy, low wages and widening wealth gap - it also reflects growing worries by Taiwanese people that the island may become too economically dependent on China and that this will make it hard for Taiwan to fend off pressures by Beijing to reunify with it one day. \n \n The message voters have sent Beijing is that, while they want reduced tensions and good relations, they cherish Taiwan\'s sovereignty, democracy and self-rule even more. \n \n The challenge now is for Ms Tsai to find a way to work with China, the island\'s biggest export market, trade partner and security threat. \n \n Ms Tsai, a former scholar, has said she wants to ""maintain [the] status quo"" with China. \n \n She became chairwoman of the DPP in 2008, after it saw a string of corruption scandals. \n \n She lost a presidential bid in 2012 but has subsequently led the party to regional election victories. She has won increased support from the public partly because of widespread dissatisfaction over the KMT and President Ma Ying-jeou\'s handling of the economy and widening wealth gap. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Eric Chu\'s loss shows the KMT has lost a nearly 70-year monopoly on power \n \n Saturday\'s polls come after a historic meeting between President Ma and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in November for talks that were seen as largely symbolic - the first in more than 60 years. \n \n Eric Chu, 54, is the mayor of New Taipei City and stepped up to become chairman of the party in October. \n \n The KMT has lost its majority in the legislature for the first time in history. \n \n The former accounting professor was seen as popular with young people in the party, but had been unable to change public opinion that is increasingly unhappy with the party\'s friendly stance towards China and the island\'s economic travails. \n \n In 2014, hundreds of students occupied the parliament in the largest show of anti-China sentiment on the island for years. Labelled the Sunflower Movement, protesters demanded more transparency in trade pacts negotiated with China. \n \n Taiwan for all practical purposes been independent since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled to the island as the Communists, under Mao Zedong, swept to power.']",2,"– Tsai Ing-wen promised a ""new era"" for Taiwan on Saturday after being elected as the island's first female president. The 59-year-old, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, defeated the Nationalist Party's Eric Chu with around 60% of the vote, reports the Los Angeles Times. Tsai will take office in May. Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has already served two terms and Taiwan's constitution didn't allow him to seek a third, the AP notes. ""We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn't work hard enough,"" Chu told supporters at party headquarters, announcing his resignation as party chief. The election marks what the BBC calls a ""turning point in Taiwan's democracy and relationship with China,"" which still officially considers the island to be a renegade province. ""I am very happy. I feel I have finally accomplished something for Taiwan, so that Taiwan will have great autonomy instead of just following China,"" a 32-year-old engineer who voted for Tsai tells the LAT. Tsai has said she favors maintaining the status quo, though her refusal to support the principle of reunification between China and Taiwan makes it uncertain whether the closer ties with Beijing that Ma introduced will continue, reports the AP."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Sarah Fitzpatrick, Tracy Connor, Tom Winter and Ben Collins \n \n Stormy Daniels\' attorney claimed Tuesday that President Donald Trump\'s personal lawyer Michael Cohen received $500,000 from a company controlled by a Russian oligarch, deposited into an account for a company also used to pay off the adult film actress. \n \n Daniels\' attorney, Michael Avenatti, also detailed other transactions he said were suspicious, including deposits from drug giant Novartis, the state-run Korea Aerospace Industries, and AT&T. \n \n Novartis confirmed it had paid Cohen\'s company, Essential Consultants, and said Special Counsel Robert Mueller had inquired about the arrangement in November. AT&T also confirmed it paid Cohen\'s company, for ""insights"" into the Trump administration. \n \n Avenatti\'s claims, made in a dossier posted to Twitter, could suggest a new dimension to the federal investigation into Cohen. NBC News has reviewed financial documents that appear to support Avenatti’s account of the transactions. \n \n ""This thing is a pig and they can try to put lipstick on a pig — tonight, next week, next month — but it\'s still gonna be a pig,"" Avenatti said on MSNBC\'s ""The Last Word with Lawrence O\'Donnell."" \n \n ""This thing\'s ugly and it\'s gonna get worse."" \n \n Cohen disputed Avenatti\'s accounting but provided no details. \n \n ""His document is inaccurate,"" he said as he left a Manhattan hotel and got into a cab Wednesday morning. \n \n Avenatti said his investigation uncovered that $4.4 million flowed through a First Republic account linked to Essential Consultants between October 2016 and January 2018. Essential Consultants is the company Cohen created before the 2016 election and then used to wire $130,000 to Daniels to stop her from going public with her account of an alleged sexual affair with Trump a decade ago. \n \n In particular, Avenatti identified eight transactions between January and August 2017, totaling half a million dollars, from U.S.-based Columbus Nova, which he said is controlled by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg and Vekselberg\'s cousin Andrew Intrater. \n \n In a statement, an attorney for Columbus Nova said the management firm is owned and controlled by Americans and not Vekselberg, who is the president of the Russian conglomerate Renovo Group. \n \n ""After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,"" the Columbus Nova statement said. \n \n ""Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova\'s engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. \n \n ""Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova\'s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement."" \n \n This thing is a pig and they can try to put lipstick on a pig — tonight, next week, next month — but it\'s still gonna be a pig. \n \n Columbus Nova was listed on the website of the Renova Group as one of its ""companies"" until November 2017. Renova\'s website is now listed as ""under construction,"" but older versions remain on The Wayback Machine, which creates archives of sites across the web. \n \n In a statement, Columbus Nova\'s attorney said the firm ""has managed assets on behalf of Renova Group companies and other clients.

Avenatti says he has information showing that... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — Stormy Daniels\' lawyer said Tuesday he has information showing that Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump\'s longtime personal attorney, received $500,000 from a company associated with a Russian billionaire within months of paying hush money to Daniels, a porn star who claims she had an affair with Trump. \n \n Lawyer Michael Avenatti also said hundreds of thousands of dollars streamed into Cohen\'s account from companies, including pharmaceutical giant Novartis, AT&T and Korea Aerospace, with U.S. government business interests. AT&T confirmed its connection Tuesday evening. \n \n Avenatti did not reveal the source of his information or release documentation. But in a seven-page memo, Avenatti detailed what he said were wire transfers going into and out of the account Cohen used to pay Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 to stay silent about her alleged affair with the soon-to-be president. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \n \n Financial documents reviewed Tuesday by The Associated Press appeared to back up Avenatti\'s report. \n \n The memo, containing highly specific dates and amounts, stated that Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire, and his cousin ""routed"" eight payments totaling approximately $500,000 to Cohen\'s company, Essential Consultants, between January and August 2017. The reason for the payment was not known. \n \n Speculating without offering proof, the Avenatti memo said, ""It appears these funds may have replenished the account following the payment to Ms. Clifford."" \n \n Avenatti\'s memo said the deposits into the account controlled by Cohen were made by Columbus Nova, an American investment company affiliated with the Renova Group, which is controlled by Vekselberg. \n \n Columbus Nova\'s attorney Richard Owens stressed in a statement that the company is ""solely owned and controlled by Americans"" and said that, after Trump\'s inauguration, the firm hired Cohen as a business consultant ""regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,"" but that it had nothing to do with Vekselberg. \n \n Owens said any suggestion that Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Cohen was false. ""Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else, other than Columbus Nova\'s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement,"" he said. \n \n Cohen and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen is currently under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, but hasn\'t been charged. \n \n At the time of the payments, there was an active FBI counterintelligence investigation — which special counsel Robert Mueller took over last May — into Russian election interference and any possible coordination with Trump associates. \n \n Vekselberg was targeted for U.S. sanctions by the Trump administration last month. He built his fortune, currently estimated by Forbes at $14.6 billion, by investing in the aluminum and oil industries. More recently, he has expanded his assets to include industrial equipment and high technology. \n \n Offering confirmation for more of the payments, AT&T said in a statement that Essential Consultants was one of several firms it ""engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration."" \n \n Avenatti alleged that the company made four $50,000 payments to Cohen totaling $200,000 in late 2017 and early 2018. \n \n AT&T said Cohen\'s company ""did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017."" Cohen is not a registered lobbyist, according to public records. \n \n Such a confidential relationship would not violate federal lobbying laws if Cohen did not seek to influence Trump on the companies\' behalf. But hiring the president\'s personal attorney for advice on how to woo Trump would be highly unusual, especially given that Cohen was never formally involved in the campaign or Trump\'s administration. \n \n Making the arrangement even stranger, the blue-chip companies\' payments to Cohen were routed to Essential Consultants LLC — the same company Cohen used to buy Stormy Daniels\' silence about her alleged affair with the President. \n \n Trump\'s Justice Department has sued to block AT&T from an $85 billion merger with Time Warner, saying it would hurt competition and consumers would have to pay more to watch their favorite shows. \n \n Korea Aerospace, which is alleged to have paid Cohen $150,000 in November 2017, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Novartis, a multinational pharmaceutical company, could not confirm or deny the payment, but said any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before the company\'s current CEO took over in February of this year and have since expired. \n \n The memo alleges the company paid Cohen $399,920 in late 2017 and early 2018 in four payments — each amounting to $99,980. \n \n Trump had dinner with Novartis\' soon-to-be CEO Vasant Narasimhan, along with other European executives, at the World Economic Forum in Davos shortly after the date of the final payment. \n \n Larry Noble, senior director of the Campaign Legal Center, said there\'s nothing technically wrong with companies like Novartis and AT&T hiring people like Cohen to provide insight into the president\'s thinking. But he said the arrangement described by Avenatti ""certainly doesn\'t look good."" \n \n ""Why would you go to the president\'s private fixer?"" he asked. ""He\'s not known for policy and he\'s not in the administration. You\'re going to someone who can get you access and tell you about the person of the president. That\'s unusual."" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Chad Day and Jeff Horwitz in Washington, Jake Pearson in New York and Mike Balsamo in Los Angeles contributed to this report.', '(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller \'s investigators have questioned a Russian oligarch about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments his company\'s US affiliate made to President Donald Trump\'s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, after the election, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n \n Viktor Vekselberg, chairman of asset manager Renova Group, is an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, and last month the Trump administration placed him on a list of sanctioned Russians for activities including election interference. The purpose of the payments, which predate the sanctions, and the nature of the business relationship between Vekselberg and Cohen is unclear. \n \n The scrutiny of the payments could add to the legal troubles for Cohen, whose home and office were raided last month as part of a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. In court documents, the prosecutors said at least part of their inquiry stemmed from a referral from Mueller\'s office. \n \n The questions asked of Vekselberg suggest that Mueller investigators have been examining some of Cohen\'s business relationships as part of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Vekselberg is one of two Russian oligarchs the FBI stopped earlier this year after their private jets landed in New York-area airports as part of Mueller\'s investigation. \n \n Investigators also asked Vekselberg about donations the head of his US affiliate made to Trump\'s inaugural fund and campaign funds, sources said. \n \n The attorney for Stormy Daniels -- the porn star who received $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair she had with Trump a decade ago -- produced information Tuesday evening that appears to add further details to CNN\'s reporting. Michael Avenatti alleged that Cohen received half a million dollars from a company affiliated with Vekselberg in the months after the presidential election. \n \n Avenatti alleged the $500,000 went into the bank account for Essential Consultants, a shell company that Cohen set up before the election that was used to pay Daniels. Avenatti added that the payments occurred from January to August 2017. \n \n CNN has reviewed documents that appear to show these payments. CNN has not independently authenticated the documents. \n \n Prosecutors have not accused Cohen of wrongdoing in regard to the payments or any other business dealings. \n \n What FBI agents wanted to know \n \n FBI agents asked Vekselberg about payments his company\'s American affiliate, Columbus Nova, made to Cohen, according to one source. The Russian was questioned as well about $300,000 in political donations by Andrew Intrater, Vekselberg\'s American cousin who is the head of Columbus Nova, sources said. \n \n Intrater was also questioned by Mueller\'s investigators, two sources told CNN. Last month, Vekselberg was placed on the US government\'s list of sanctioned individuals, prohibiting him from traveling to the US. \n \n The payments occurred at the same time Cohen was trying to build a consulting and legal business after the election and around the time he left the Trump Organization. At that time, he was still Trump\'s personal lawyer. Even last month, as Trump responded to questions about the payment to Daniels, the President deferred to Cohen and said, ""Michael is my attorney."" \n \n In court filings, Cohen\'s attorney said that Cohen has seven clients for whom he provides ""strategic advice and business consulting."" The attorney did not specify whether Columbus Nova was one of those clients. \n \n After publication, Columbus Nova provided a statement from its attorney, Richard Owens. \n \n ""Columbus Nova is a management company solely owned and controlled by Americans,"" the statement said. ""After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures. Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova\'s engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova\'s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement."" \n \n Later Tuesday, Eric Kosta, general counsel of Columbus Nova, sent this statement: ""As the General Counsel of Columbus Nova, I can confirm that the company is 100% owned and controlled by Americans. Any suggestion that at any point in time Viktor Vekselberg or any of his companies owned or exercised any control over Columbus Nova is patently untrue."" \n \n Intrater did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Vekselberg did not respond to a request for comment, nor did representatives for his company in Russia. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Prosecutors with the US attorney\'s office in Manhattan are investigating Cohen\'s personal financial dealings, including his taxi business and payments made to silence Daniels, sources have told CNN. The FBI raided Cohen\'s home, office and hotel room last month, seizing at least eight boxes of documents and more than a dozen electronic devices. Cohen\'s attorney said the inquiry was referred by Mueller\'s team. \n \n Campaign donations under scrutiny \n \n Vekselberg\'s cousin Intrater gave generously to support Trump. \n \n He donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration fund, $35,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, and $29,600 to the Republican National Committee in June 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. \n \n While it is illegal for foreigners to donate to US politics, Intrater is American. \n \n However, the donations were a sharp increase from previous cycles and may raise questions for investigators. Intrater\'s only previous political donations included $1,200 to Democrat Bill Richardson\'s presidential run in 2008 and $2,600 in 2014 for Republican Chris Day\'s congressional race in New York. Renova Group donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, but it\'s not clear when the contribution occurred, according to the foundation\'s public list of donors. \n \n Vekselberg may also be of interest to investigators because of his close ties to the Kremlin. He built his fortune following the collapse of the Soviet Union through a series of deals in the oil and gas sector. In 2004, he paid over $100 million to buy nine Faberge eggs from the American Forbes family, returning the second-largest collection of imperial eggs to Russia. Six years later, he was appointed by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to lead the Skolkovo Innovation Center project, the Kremlin\'s answer to Silicon Valley. \n \n From 2007 until March 2012, Vekselberg was a shareholder and chairman of the board of Rusal, the aluminum company controlled by Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska has business ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been indicted on fraud and tax related charges as part of Mueller\'s investigation. Manafort has pleaded not guilty. Deripaska, who also was added to the US sanctions list last month, has sued Manafort over a soured investment deal. \n \n Lamesa Investments Ltd, an affiliate of Renova, acquired a large stake in the Bank of Cyprus at the same time Wilbur Ross, then a private equity investor, made a capital infusion into the then-struggling bank. Lamesa now holds a 9.2% stake in the Bank of Cyprus. Ross resigned from his position as vice chairman of the bank after he was confirmed as Trump\'s commerce secretary. \n \n Vekselberg also attended the December 2015 dinner in Moscow for RT, the state-controlled television channel, where Michael Flynn, Trump\'s former national security adviser, sat beside Putin, according to NBC News. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying about a call he had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition and is cooperating with the Mueller investigation. \n \n Update: This story has been updated to include Columbus Nova\'s latest statement.', 'Michael Cohen, a longtime lawyer for President Trump, was reportedly hired last year by the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladi\xadmir Putin. (Seth Wenig/AP) \n \n President Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen was hired last year by the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian business magnate who attended Trump’s inauguration and was recently subjected to sanctions by the U.S. government, the company said Tuesday. \n \n The New York investment firm Columbus Nova said it retained Cohen as a consultant “regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.” Though Columbus Nova has been described in federal regulatory filings as an affiliate of the Renova Group, founded by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, the company said Vekselberg was not involved with hiring or paying Cohen. \n \n The company’s confirmation came after Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, circulated on Twitter a document purporting to show a detailed accounting of wire transfers made to Essential Consultants, a company established by Cohen in October 2016. \n \n The payments listed in the document began in the months after Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the November 2016 election, as part of an agreement that required her to not speak publicly about an affair she says she had with Trump a decade earlier. \n \n In the document, Avenatti claims that Cohen received $500,000 from Columbus Nova between January 2017 and August 2017. \n \n Avenatti did not provide supporting documentation for his claims, though Columbus Nova and AT&T;, another company named in the document, both released statements in the hours after Avenatti’s disclosure confirming that they had business relationships with Cohen. \n \n Avenatti alleged that Vekselberg might have provided funds that “replenished the account” following Cohen’s payments to Daniels. In a statement, a spokesman for Vekselberg said neither the Russian billionaire nor the Renova Group has any “contractual relationship” with Cohen. \n \n [Analysis: How money flowed through Michael Cohen’s multipurpose shell company] \n \n The payments from Columbus Nova point to a potential new financial tie between the president’s personal lawyer and a U.S. representative of a key Russian figure. Vekselberg, who is close to Russian President Vladi\xadmir Putin, was one of two dozen Russian business executives and government officials sanctioned in April as part of the U.S. response to the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer in southern England. \n \n Columbus Nova hired Cohen as U.S. investigators were ramping up their inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The chief executive of the U.S. affiliate is Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, a U.S. citizen who donated $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration and made additional contributions to a Trump campaign committee and to the Republican National Committee. \n \n More broadly, the revelations show that companies with business interests before the U.S. government hired Cohen, a longtime Trump associate, by paying him through Essential Consultants, which he also used to pay Daniels before the election. \n \n The document from Avenatti says AT&T; paid Cohen $50,000 a month for four months starting in October 2017, just weeks before Trump’s Justice Department filed suit to block AT&T;’s acquisition of Time Warner. \n \n A spokesman for AT&T; confirmed that the company engaged Essential Consultants, a company formed by Cohen in early 2017, “to provide insights into understanding the new administration.” \n \n “They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,” the spokesman added. \n \n Cohen was receiving payments from Columbus Nova during the same months that Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has said Trump was paying Cohen $35,000 a month in legal fees. \n \n Giuliani has said Trump’s money served as a reimbursement for the funds Cohen provided to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \n \n Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Cohen, did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Cohen’s finances are of intense interest to federal authorities in New York, who last month served search warrants on his home, office and hotel room, gathering documents related to the Daniels payment as well as to Cohen’s personal businesses. \n \n Cohen’s lawyers have fought in court to restrict prosecutors’ access to the material seized in those raids. As part of that legal fight, they told a judge that in 2017, Cohen had three legal clients and seven clients to whom he provided “strategic advice and business consulting.” \n \n Avenatti’s document might provide a road map to those clients. He claims that Cohen also received payments from the drug company Novartis Investments and from Korea Aerospace Industries. Each has important business considerations with the U.S. government. \n \n Shortly after the last transaction from Novartis identified by Avenatti, in January, Trump met with executives including the incoming CEO of Novartis, Vas Narasimhan, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \n \n A Novartis spokesman said any agreements with Essential Consultants took place before the new CEO took over in February and have since expired. \n \n Korea Aerospace is in contention for a multibillion-dollar joint contract with Lockheed Martin to produce jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force. A company representative confirmed paying the Cohen company, but said the payments were to provide legal consulting to assist in the company’s reorganization of its “internal accounting system” and did not involve the Air Force deal or other lobbying. \n \n The company added that it learned only recently of Essential Consultants’ Trump ties. \n \n In a Wednesday morning tweet, Avenatti said it was “priceless” to watch the various companies that paid Cohen try to explain their reasons for doing so. \n \n “Watching all of the companies that sent money to the LLC slush fund come up with different alleged reasons for hiring Mr. Cohen — ‘accounting advice,’ ‘real estate consulting,’ ‘insight,’ etc. Who knew Mr. Cohen was such a brilliant renaissance man?” \n \n Vekselberg is a Russian billionaire who regularly participates in gatherings of Russian business leaders with Putin and sometimes meets one on one with the Russian president, according to news accounts and people familiar with his role. \n \n In March 2017, the two sat down to discuss infrastructure projects, according to Russian state news reports. Vekselberg funds several critically important prestige projects, including Skolkovo, the business incubator touted as Russia’s answer to Silicon Valley. \n \n Vekselberg’s spokesman Andrey Shtorkh confirmed to The Washington Post in January that Vekselberg had attended Trump’s inauguration as a guest of one of his American business partners. \n \n A person familiar with the inauguration said the partner was Intrater, and the New York Times has reported that Intrater and Vekselberg have both been interviewed by prosecutors working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. \n \n Two people familiar with Mueller’s probe told The Post that the special counsel is investigating whether foreign money helped fund Trump’s inauguration. By law, only U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents can donate to a U.S. inaugural committee. \n \n In addition to Intrater’s donation to Trump’s inauguration, an additional $1 million to support the inauguration came from Access Industries, which was founded by Leonard Blavatnik, a Soviet-born American British billionaire who is a longtime friend and business associate of Vekselberg. \n \n Shtorkh told The Post in January that Vekselberg had met the past three U.S. presidents as part of his efforts to expand Russia’s international economic relations but that this was the first time the magnate attended a presidential inauguration. \n \n Photographs also show that Vekselberg attended a December 2015 dinner in Moscow to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Russian television network RT. Another attendee of the dinner, seated next to Putin, was Michael Flynn, who later became Trump’s national security adviser. \n \n Alice Crites, Carol D.

Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have ""replenished the account"" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it ""engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,"" the AP reports.

93,"['LAPORTE, Ind. (WOOD) — A man convicted of four 1993 murders who escaped Sunday from a state prison outside of Ionia was captured in Indiana Monday evening. \n \n Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. \n \n The sheriff’s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle’s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff’s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. \n \n Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn’t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. \n \n Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff’s office said. \n \n “He ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,” Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. \n \n That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. \n \n Elliot then tried to climb out of the car’s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot’s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. \n \n When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was “‘the Michael Elliot,” and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn’t lie about his identity. \n \n Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. \n \n Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and “a couple of jackets.” \n \n Wright said authorities didn’t know Elliot would be in their area — there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area — and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot. Wright said he was relieved that he and Czupryna were able to get Elliot off the streets and bring worried citizens some peace of mind. \n \n In a Monday night news release, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder thanked the law enforcement agencies that aided in the search and capture of Elliot. “The swift apprehension of this dangerous criminal is a credit to law enforcement and corrections officials in Michigan and Indiana, and our partners with the U.S. Marshals Service. Their courage, diligence and professionalism reminds us how fortunate we are to have such men and women who are willing to keep our communities safe. …Now that we are assured the public is safe, we will turn our attention to thoroughly reviewing the situation that led to the prisoner’s escape. We will demand an exhaustive assessment of the incident and take whatever appropriate action is needed to prevent future incidents.” \n \n Elliot escaped around 7 p.m. Sunday from the Ionia Correctional Facility, but jail workers didn’t notice he was missing until a routine prisoner check at 9 p.m. \n \n Authorities said Elliot left through the sally port, a secured garage where prisoners are brought into the facility. Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. \n \n He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area. The woman escaped at a gas station there and he fled in her Jeep Liberty. That SUV was found early Monday morning in Shipshewana, Ind. \n \n LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana. \n \n Elliot was serving five life sentences in the Ionia Correctional Facility after being convicted of four 1993 murders. \n \n In the early morning of Aug. 8, 1993, according to court documents, Elliot broke into a home in Bentley Township, north of Midland, killed four people then set the house on fire. Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. \n \n Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed. Charles Treece was also convicted of four counts of first-degree murder, armed robbery and setting a house on fire, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a firearm. He is also serving life in prison at the Alger Correctional Facility in Munising in the Upper Peninsula. \n \n LaCross, who was 16 at the time and is victim Vickie Currie’s daughter, and Paul Treece both testified against Elliot. Under the terms of plea agreements, they pleaded guilty to robbery and felony firearm charges. \n \n In 2005, Elliot filed a motion for release, saying that there was new evidence in his case — namely a 1994 letter from Charles Treece that attested to Elliot’s innocence. A state court denied his request. \n \n Elliot maintains he is innocent, according to the court documents. \n \n —– \n \n Inside woodtv.com: \n \n Michael Elliot escapes from Ionia Correctional Facility \n \n Former guard: Elliot’s escape a ‘mystery’ \n \n ‘Thorough’ investigation of escape promised \n \n Son ‘proud’ of Elliot’s carjack victim for staying calm \n \n Victim’s mother worried Elliot would kill again \n \n Life as a Level II prison inmate \n \n Share this: Email \n \n Print \n \n Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google \n \n Pinterest \n \n More \n \n LinkedIn \n \n Tumblr \n \n \n \n Reddit', 'More Video... \n \n A source close to the investigation tells NewsCenter 16 convicted murderer Michael Elliot was arrested in LaPorte County after a chase Monday night. \n \n The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. \n \n Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. \n \n Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday.

Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. \n \n They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. \n \n After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. \n \n They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. \n \n Elliot fled in the victim\'s car before police arrived. \n \n Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. \n \n ""You can go a lot of places in seven hours,"" said Sgt. Ron Galaviz with the Indiana State Police. ""Especially if you have a mode of transportation. And, I\'m not suggesting he does. But, again, we\'re looking for stolen vehicle reports or anything of that nature to help follow up on, to help us pursue on that trail."" \n \n Police went door-to-door looking for any signs of Elliot in Shipshewana. Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. \n \n Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don\'t know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. \n \n ""What we\'re asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,"" Galaviz said. ""If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don\'t investigate it. Call 911."" \n \n \\NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville says early Monday morning, a woman thought she spotted Elliot at a Tennessee gas station. But, police say it was a false identification. Elliot has family in Tennessee. \n \n He is described as a 5\'8, 165-pound white male with brown hair and eyes. Elliot was wearing a blue and orange state prison uniform when he escaped, but he was last seen in black pants, a white t-shirt, white tennis shoes and a white beanie cap. \n \n Elliot should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who comes in contact with him, should contact law enforcement immediately. \n \n According to Grand Rapids-based WOOD-TV, Elliot was serving five life sentences for four murders and an armed robbery. He was convicted in 1993. He was also serving 13 years for setting a house on fire and two years for using a firearm during the commission of a felony.']",2,"– A convicted killer who escaped from a Michigan prison yesterday and carjacked a woman has been arrested after a car chase in rural LaPorte Country, Indiana, WNDU reports. Michael David Elliot, 40, allegedly stole a woman's red jeep and abandoned it in the small town of Shipshewana, Indiana, this afternoon. A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot ""can go a lot of places in seven hours,"" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence. Then a call about a stolen vehicle came in to the LaPorte County Sheriff's Office, and a deputy saw the vehicle and attempted a traffic stop, WOOD-TV reports. But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in Kankakee Township; Elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked. He was serving five life sentences for the murders of four people when he broke out of the Ionia Correctional Facility yesterday by slipping through a gap in the fencing system."
94,"['""War by its nature entails waste. But the scale of the problems in Iraq and Afghanistan also reflects the toxic interplay of huge sums of money pumped into relatively small economies and an unprecedented reliance on contractors,"" the report said. \n \n Sen. James Webb, D-Virginia, who helped establish the commission three years ago, said Friday that its latest proposals deserve attention from Congress and the Department of Defense and called for a hearing on the matter. \n \n ""The report\'s specific recommendations to address the federal government\'s overreliance on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan and failure to control the process underscore the importance of the Commission\'s charter,"" Webb said in a prepared statement. \n \n The report repeatedly criticized the federal government for turning to contractors for too many purposes, including monitoring other contractors. \n \n ""The government has abdicated its contracting responsibilities -- too often using contractors as the default mechanism, driven by considerations other than whether they provide the best solution, and without consideration for the resources needed to manage them,"" the report said. \n \n The commission is calling for major reforms to how the government awards and monitors contractors on military, reconstruction and training programs. \n \n ""When it comes to oversight of contingency contracting, we\'ve been driving beyond the reach of our headlights,"" Commission Co-Chairman Michael Thibault said in a statement released with the report. ""Reforms are badly needed."" \n \n The report says that contractors often face great risks. ""Between September 2001 and December 2010, over 2,200 contractor employees of all nationalities have died and over 49,800 were injured in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" the report says. ""These contractors\' deaths and injuries should not be ignored, but should be a part of the public debate on the cost of war."" \n \n Among the proposals to rein in contractors is the creation of special teams of full-time federal workers to be ready to deploy and monitor projects. The report says the government also should restrict reliance on contractors for security by embedding government workers responsible for command and control and oversight.', '-An ill-conceived project, no matter how well-managed, is wasteful if it does not fit the cultural, political and economic mores of the society it is meant to serve, or if it cannot be supported and maintained. \n \n \n \n -Poor planning and oversight by the US government, as well as poor performance on the part of contractors, have costly outcomes: time and money misspent are lost for other purposes. \n \n \n \n -Criminal behavior and blatant corruption sap dollars from what could otherwise be successful project outcomes and, more disturbingly, contribute to a climate in which huge amounts of waste are accepted as the norm. \n \n \n \n Since 2002, the United States has spent $117 billion on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to a new report by the non-partisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, tens of billions of those dollars have been wasted.The report\'s authors note that the ""waste, fraud, and abuse"" they have observed in these contract programs were caused by significant errors. A few of their points, quoted from the report:The U.S. has relied on contractors more heavily in these two wars than in previous others, hiring about 200,000 of them to ""guard bases, build facilities, provide food and laundry services, escort supply and personnel movements, and translate local languages,"" according to Susan Crabtree at Talking Points Memo. She points out that there are almost as many contracted employees working in Afghanistan and Iraq as there are military troops.The commission that put out the report is urging the government to reform its contracting programs and is holding a hearing to review the report\'s findings today.', 'WASHINGTON -- The chairmen of the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting decried on Monday a federal system that has allowed contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan to commit fraud -- then get hired again and again. \n \n ""For the 200,000 people employed by contractors to provide support and capability in Iraq and Afghanistan, accountability is too often absent, diluted, delayed, or avoided,"" Republican co-chair Chris Shays, formerly a longtime congressman from Connecticut, said while calling to order a hearing of the commission Monday. \n \n There are so many barriers to suspending or banning contractors with violations that ""untrustworthy contractors can continue profiting from government work, responsible businesses may be denied opportunities, and costs to taxpayers can climb,"" Shays said in a statement co-authored with his Democratic co-chair, Michael Thibault, formerly the deputy director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency. \n \n The commission last week issued a blistering interim report to Congress: ""At What Risk? Correcting over-reliance on contractors in contingency operations,"" which concluded that ""misspent dollars run into the tens of billions"" out of the nearly $200 billion spent on contracts and grants since 2002 to support military, reconstruction and other U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n And that could well be an understatement, the commission noted, because ""it might not take full account of ill-conceived projects, poor planning and oversight by the U.S. government, and criminal behavior and blatant corruption by both government and contractor employees."" \n \n The report suggested that the government stop using contractors so routinely, start taking oversight more seriously and establish strong interagency standards. \n \n It called for an end to contractors\' current role in hiring other contractors, concluding that they tend not to erect the appropriate oversight firewalls. \n \n And most controversially, the report said the extensive use of private security contractors -- which has surged under President Barack Obama -- raises use-of-force issues and creates a gap in legal accountability \n \n So rather than let them run wild, the commission recommended that agencies relying on private security contractors be required to embed government personnel among them who would be ""responsible for leadership, command and control, and oversight of all security contractors and operations."" \n \n (The commission also promised that its final report, due this summer, will further address the over-reliance on private contractors to provide ""movement security"" for government workers in war zones. That\'s a shot across the bow of the State Department.) \n \n The commission\'s findings, however, are just the latest in a litany of official and journalistic reports about the enormous cost of waste, fraud and corruption in Iraq and, particularly, Afghanistan. \n \n Just last month, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction warned that the entire $11.4 billion for constructing and maintaining nearly 900 Afghan National Security Forces facilities is at risk due to inadequate planning. \n \n The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction said in 2009 that an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in U.S.-funded infrastructure contracting had been wasted there. \n \n McClatchy Newspapers have exposed example after example of waste and abuse in contracts for Afghan reconstruction. \n \n A State Department cable obtained by WikiLeaks revealed late last year that Afghanistan\'s vice president had been caught carrying $52 million in cash in a Persian Gulf tax haven. \n \n (See 10 more examples.) \n \n In his remarks at Monday\'s hearing, Scott Amey, general counsel for the nonprofit watchdog group Project on Government Oversight (POGO), testified that ""contract award dollars have increased from approximately $200 billion in fiscal year 2000 to over $535 billion in fiscal year 2010."" Meanwhile, however, ""contract administration and oversight have decreased because the acquisition workforce is stretched thin,"" he said. \n \n Since 2002, POGO has maintained a Federal Contract Misconduct Database, which served as the model for the government-created Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), due to become publicly available starting in April. \n \n Witnesses at Monday\'s hearing said, however, that the federal database doesn\'t adequately record contractors\' past performance. \n \n As it happens, the Obama administration recently caved to pressure from contractors and won\'t be making that past performance data available publicly. \n \n But even internally, witnesses said, the state of the data is abysmal. Of the 1,485 past performance reports required from the Department of Defense, only 140 had been entered into the database. Of the 174 required from the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, not a single one could actually be found, although USAID insisted 24 had been entered. \n \n And Dan Gordon, President Obama\'s administrator for federal procurement policy, said three-quarters of the performance reports that were filed still lacked required documentation. \n \n But judging from POGO\'s database, Amey testified: \n \n Some of the largest service contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan have checkered histories of misconduct, including instances of shooting civilians, false claims against the government, violations of the Anti-Kickback Act, fraud, retaliation against workers\' complaints, and environmental violations. \n \n Amey also raised an all-too-familiar concern, though from another context: \n \n The government\'s inability to hold all contractors accountable begs the question: Is the government so reliant on large contractors that bad actors are required to preserving legitimate competition and mission accomplishment? This might be the contracting version of ""too big to fail."" \n \n ************************* \n \n Dan Froomkin is senior Washington correspondent for the Huffington Post.

95,"[""BENSALEM, Pa. (CBS) — Several multi-vehicles crashes, involving as many as 100 cars and dozens of tractor-trailers stretched over several miles of icy highway, shut down the Pennsylvania Turnpike for most of the day today between Willow Grove and Bensalem, Pa. \n \n One crash area involved approximately 75 cars and several tractor-trailers in the eastbound lanes of the highway. The westbound lanes were closed to allow access by emergency vehicles. \n \n According to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 30 people were injured and transported to local hospitals. Doylestown Hospital confirmed it was treating one victim who was in stable condition, while Abington was reportedly treating 16 people. St. Mary’s Medical Center, in Langhorne, was treating seven and Temple University Hospital was treating one. CBS 3 is told five of the injuries are classified as serious, but none are considered life-threatening. \n \n Dr. John Kelly, chief of staff at Abington, says the good news is none of the injuries are serious. \n \n “The word that we have is that we may have seen the most severely injured at this point in time, which we’re pleased to say did not include any life-threatening injuries that we are aware of.” \n \n Kelly explained what kind of injuries they were seeing, “In a blunt trauma situation, you’re going to have a lot of soft tissue and bone type injuries. I’m unaware of any fractures to date. We did have one patient who had a closed- head injury but appears to be recovering well from that.” \n \n The incident began about 8:30am in the eastbound lanes between Willow Grove and the Route 1 exits in Bensalem, Pa. \n \n Another crash happened closer to the Route 1 exit. That accident area involved approximately 30 cars and included a jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n Chopper 3 was over the scene where it appeared at least four cars were stuck under the jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n “We believe that it looks like at this point that the initial incident involved several tractor-trailer trucks. There have been reports of three to four. State police are working through sorting all that out right now,” Carl DeFebo of the Pa. Turnpike Commission said. \n \n \n \n “Scared to death, just thinking that it wasn’t going to stop,” remembered Kate Garwood. “You kinda think you’re going to continue to get hit.” \n \n “I was able to get off to the shoulder,” said Terry Foley, who drives the route to work every day. “I didn’t hit the car in front of me. I said, ‘I survived,’ and then somebody comes flying in the back of me.” \n \n CBS 3 traffic reporter Bob Kelly called this “the worst accident I have seen in the 20 years I have been doing this.” \n \n The Pa. Turnpike Commission reported around 3:30 p.m. that the tractor-trailer blocking all eastbound lanes was moved to allow trapped backlog to get past the scene in the left lane to continue eastbound on I-276. Disabled commercial vehicles remained, but all passenger vehicles in the backlog had been removed. \n \n Other crews were removing small portions of the concrete median, to allow drivers trapped on the eastbound turnpike to U-turn onto the westbound lanes (which were also shut down to all but emergency vehicles) and get off the turnpike. \n \n The turnpike was reopened to traffic just before 4pm — about 7½ hours after the first crash occurred. \n \n Investigators indicate icy conditions and sun glare are being blamed as likely culprits in causing the pileup. \n \n One driver said that road spray on windshields plus the sun low in the sky may have hindered visibility as drivers found themselves suddenly upon a stopped vehicle ahead with insufficient room to stop on the slick pavement. \n \n Terry Foley seemed to agree. \n \n “It’s all ice,” Foley said. \n \n A total of 75 cars and trucks, including six tractor trailers, were taken to Rob Liepziger’s tow yard in Bristol, Bucks County alone. Many of them have front-end damage, back-end damage and a lot of the vehicles have been totaled. \n \n Rob’s been in the towing business for more than 30 years. \n \n “I haven’t seen anything like this in forever that I’ve been out here,” Liepziger said. \n \n Top Content On CBSPhilly PHOTOS: Summer's Hottest Concerts \n \n VIDEO: Latest News & Weather \n \n AUDIO: Podcasts & Shows \n \n NEWS: Top Headlines \n \n PHOTOS: View The Best Galleries"", 'Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Text 46373 To \'NEWS\' To Get Breaking News Alerts From FOX 29 \n \n It was an all-day mess on the Pennsylvania Turnpike with the road shut down for miles after two major pileups and several other wrecks in between. \n \n The crashes left dozens of drivers stranded in the cold. Up to 50 cars were involved in those pileups. \n \n Here\'s what we know: \n \n The crashes on Interstate 276 were first reported just after 8 a.m. right in the middle of the morning rush, closing the turnpike between Willow Grove and the Philadelphia Interchanges in Bensalem; \n \n A total of 27 people were taken to hospitals, at least four of them with serious injuries; \n \n Drivers say the roadway was icy and incredibly slick. \n \n From the air, the long scene looked like an auto junkyard with dozens and dozens of cars and trucks scattered every which way. \n \n Drivers caught in the middle of the wreckage told us traffic had been moving smoothly at 50 to 55 mph until suddenly, ""All we saw was brake lights. Everybody locked up their wheels, and next thing you know the sun glare, the spray from the road, everything hit us all at once,"" said Bill Warrin, of Broomall, Pa. \n \n ""It was like a perfect storm, and then boom,"" he added. \n \n At the front of dozens of separate wrecks were two 18-wheelers, a box truck and several passenger cars. \n \n This stretch of the turnpike is three tight lanes, a wall of snow on one side, a concrete median Jersey barrier on the other. \n \n When cars ahead began to crash, there was no way to avoid impact. \n \n From the ground it was clear there was plenty of hard, packed ice on the road surface, a reminder of our massive snowstorm that lasted Wednesday night into Friday morning. \n \n But drivers told us conditions were deceiving. \n \n ""It was much icier once you got out of the car than you expected it to be,"" said Frank Atkinson, of Furlong, Pa. ""It seemed like it was slushy maybe, but it didn\'t seem like it was icy."" \n \n The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission had lifted its storm-related speed limit and ban on some commercial vehicles just two hours before the crash. \n \n But a spokesman said that decision does not let drivers off the hook. \n \n ""It boils down to responsibility of motorists,"" turnpike spokesman Carl DeFebo said. ""That\'s our job when we\'re driving on the roads to monitor the conditions and to be sure that we are adjusting our speeds that are appropriate to whatever the driving conditions are."" \n \n By early afternoon, a parade of flat-bed tow trucks was removing vehicles caught in the mess. \n \n The extent of the damage was a reminder that the injury toll could have been much higher, FOX 29\'s Bruce Gordon reported. \n \n In the second video clip above, FOX 29\'s Thalia Perez reports that all but one of the injured persons taken to Abington Memorial Hospital had been treated and released by Friday night. You\'ll also hear from some of the motorists who were injured.']",2,"– More than 100 cars and dozens of tractor trailers have been caught up in a chain of accidents stretching over several miles of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bensalem this morning, backing up traffic for several more miles behind that. The first accident came at about 7:45am on the westbound side, causing a rubbernecking delay on the eastbound side—where the subsequent crashes occurred beginning at 8am, Fox 29 Philadelphia reports. Icy conditions are believed to be responsible—though residents say that stretch of road is so notoriously treacherous that accidents sometimes occur there in good weather. One crash site involves roughly 75 cars and several tractor trailers, CBS 3 Philadelphia reports. Another 30 cars were involved in another big wreck, in which a tractor trailer jackknifed, reportedly landing on top of at least four cars. Emergency crews are now using the westbound side to transport out the wounded. At least five people have been hospitalized so far. This is ""the worst accident I have seen in the 20 years I have been doing this,"" CBS' traffic reporter said."
96,"['Confectionery giant Nestle has failed to convince European judges that it has the right to trademark the shape of its four-finger KitKat bar in the UK. \n \n The European Court of Justice said that the company had to demonstrate the public relied on the shape alone to identify the snack. \n \n The judges concluded this was difficult to prove if goods also showed a brand name such as KitKat. \n \n Rival Cadbury has battled to prevent Nestle obtaining the trademark. \n \n Both Nestle and Cadbury said they were ""pleased"" with the ruling. \n \n The case will now return to the UK High Court for a final decision. \n \n Nestle claimed that in the 80 years since the chocolate bar was introduced, the four fingers have become almost completely associated with KitKats. \n \n In June, a senior European court lawyer, the advocate-general, disagreed saying such a trademark did not comply with European law. \n \n Nestle has not sought to trademark the two-fingered bar. \n \n Sally Britton, intellectual property lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said that Nestle was likely to continue arguing its case, ""even if, as now appears likely, the English court decides that the KitKat shape should not be registered as a trade mark"". \n \n She said Nestle had experience of trying to register difficult marks. \n \n It took more than 40 years for it to register the slogan ""Have a Break"" as a trade mark, finally succeeding in 2006, she added. \n \n Image caption Norway\'s ""Kvikk Lunsj"" looks similar to the KitKat and is available in some parts of the UK \n \n Chocolate wars \n \n Wednesday\'s ruling is the latest development in a more than 10-year legal battle between Nestle and Cadbury, which started when Cadbury tried to trademark the purple colour it uses on its Cadbury chocolate wrappers. \n \n Nestle objected and finally had the original decision allowing Cadbury to trademark the colour overturned in 2013. \n \n Now it would appear Cadbury, which is owned by US company Mondelez International, has scored a significant but not final victory in the continuing chocolate war. \n \n It has always argued the shape alone was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the rival snack. \n \n A bar called the Kvikk Lunsj, meaning ""quick lunch"", launched in Norway in 1937 is available in some UK shops, and although less well known, looks similar to the four-finger KitKat. \n \n A ruling in favour of Nestle would stop other confectionery producers making chocolate bars of the same shape or size.', 'SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Photographer: Jason Adlen/Bloomberg Photographer: Jason Adlen/Bloomberg \n \n Nestle SA may find it harder to convince U.K. judges that the shape of its KitKat chocolate bar is distinct enough to trademark after the European Union’s top tribunal set strict limits on what qualifies for the status. \n \n For a shape to deserve a trademark, owners must prove that consumers can recognize the product exclusively by that characteristic, and not in combination with another trademarked aspect, the EU Court of Justice said in a ruling Wednesday. The judgment gave both sides an opportunity to claim victory. \n \n The EU court decision will help guide a U.K. tribunal handling a clash between Cadbury, the U.K.’s biggest chocolate maker, and Nestle over the Swiss company’s 2010 application to trademark the four-fingered chocolate bar, which brought in 40 million pounds ($61.7 million) a year between 2008 and 2010 in the U.K. Cadbury separately is fighting an EU trademark Nestle got for the shape of its chocolate bar in 2006 in a case that’s been pending in a lower EU court since 2013. Any decision will determine whether or not the trademark is valid. \n \n The KitKat was first sold in Britain in 1935 by Rowntree & Co., with the shape changing very little since then. Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, bought Rowntree Plc in 1998. \n \n The U.K. Trade Marks Registry turned down the application to protect the shape of the chocolate bar in the U.K. in 2013 following the opposition from Cadbury. \n \n The EU court Wednesday said trademark protection can’t be given if a shape “contains three essential features, one of which results from the nature of the goods themselves and two of which are necessary to obtain a technical result.” \n \n Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle said it was “pleased with the decision” and “now looks forward to the decision of the U.K. High Court.” Mondelez International Inc., which owns Cadbury, said in an e-mailed statement that the court’s ruling “is in line with our contention that the shape of the KitKat bar is not distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark.” \n \n Nestle won a U.K. Court of Appeal ruling in October 2013 blocking Cadbury from obtaining a trademark for the color purple it uses to package its milk chocolate. \n \n The case is: C-215/14, Societe de Produits Nestle SA v. Cadbury UK Ltd.', 'YOUNGSTOWN — A fire that killed five children late Sunday was accidental, said city Fire Investigator Capt. Kurt Wright. \n \n Fatal Youngstown Fire Video Video Five people died in a Youngstown house fire early today. \n \n The fire at 434 Parkcliffe Ave. started on the first floor, Wright said. \n \n Wright also said the mother of the five children is hospitalized after she managed to get out of the home after it caught fire about 11:30 p.m Sunday. \n \n Wright would not comment on where the children were found. \n \n He said he did not want to comment on a cause until tests are completed by the state fire marshals office, which is assisting in the investigation, but at this point it appears to not be suspicious, he said. \n \n Five children, ages 9, 3, 2 and two 1-year-old twins, were killed in the blaze. \n \n Wright and members of the state fire marshals office just arrived to begin their investigation. \n \n A neighbor called 911 and alerted authorities about the fire. The mother reportedly jumped out of a window and told firefighters at the scene that five children were still inside the burning home. \n \n Deborah Rivera, a neighbor across the street, said she was awakened by a boom and called 911. \n \n The mother was in a vacant lot next to the house in nothing but her underwear, Rivera said. \n \n Her boyfriend, Justin Viera, said flames were shooting out of the first floor windows. \n \n ""It was blazing,"" Rivera said. \n \n Firefighters were able to get three of the five children out of the structure. Those children were given CPR and they – along with their mother – were taken to St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital. \n \n Melissa Thomas does not even know the victims, but she stopped with her daughters Elissa and Marissa Simione to drop off stuffed animals in honor of them. \n \n ""I got two kids,"" she said. ""I can\'t imagine five."" \n \n Rev. Lewis Macklin, a police chaplain, said he will be meeting today with city Councilwoman Anita Davis, D-6th, and others, to plan ways to raise funds for the family. \n \n He said he hopes a plan can be put together soon to help them out. \n \n Davis, whose ward includes Parkcliffe, went to the scene of the fire after hearing the news about it. \n \n She said it was a tragedy that five young children died in the fire. \n \n ""I hope the young lady [the mother] has family around her that will embrace her and hold her and love her and give her the support she needs,"" Davis said. \n \n Also on the scene is Bob Sharp, a former city fire investigator who now works for the state fire marshal\'s office. Wright said there were working smoke detectors in the home and they were going off when fire crews arrived. \n \n The fire is the most deadly in Youngstown since a Jan. 23, 2008, arson at 1645 Stewart Ave. that claimed the lives of two adults and four children. Five people were able to escape that blaze. \n \n That fire, unlike the late Sunday one, was intentionally set with an accelerant poured on the front porch. The motive for that fire was a dispute over a cell phone. \n \n The 1,300-square-foot house in the Newport neighborhood of the South Side was a two-story ranch with three bedrooms. The single-family house was built in 1924 and was last sold for $10,000 in September 2013, according to zillow.com. \n \n The owners of the house are Lindsey Maggie and Lindsey Henry of Campbell, according to the Mahoning County auditor\'s website.The house\'s value was $7,930, according to the website.']",3,"– It started with a candy wrapper and ended (for now) in a courtroom. Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its ""four-fingered"" KitKat have been rejected by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a KitKat, the BBC reports. The decision was a setback for Nestle—which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US—and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think ""KitKat,"" and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj (""quick lunch"") has been around for nearly as long as KitKat.

""He\'s admitting [in the video] to being a drug trafficker. And the point that he\'s in the drug business, that embarrasses him? The whole point of the movie is that he\'s in the drug business. What she\'s saying doesn\'t make any sense."" \n \n \n \n Then there was the affectionate exchange of messages between her husband and Del Castillo, leaked to the Mexican publication Milenio after his latest arrest. ""You are so beautiful, my friend, in every way,"" Guzman told the actress in one of them. ""I will take care of you more than I do my own eyes."" \n \n \n \n Coronel said she did not find the exchanges troubling. ""I think it was the first time they met.

99,"['PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Residents on the Big Island of Hawaii were alerted on Thursday to rising levels of toxic gas from lava-oozing fissures, and geologists warned that new areas east of the erupting Kilauea volcano may be at risk of molten rock bursting from the ground. \n \n Hawaii County authorities sent a text message to residents of the southeast corner of the island warning them of a wind change that would bring rising levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities. \n \n “It’s just horrible. You can’t breathe in there,” said evacuated resident Robynn Stagg, 58, who drove through the thick, orange sulfur dioxide haze earlier this week in a failed attempt to check on her home. \n \n Hawaii’s governor has warned that mass evacuations may be required as more fissures open in the ground and spew lava and gas into semi-rural residential areas on the east flank of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes. \n \n During an evening meeting with community members, an official with the United States Geological Survey’s Hawaii Volcano Observatory said that while no new fissures have opened during the last 24 hours, there has been “quite a bit” of ground cracking over the last day and that they were releasing steam. \n \n “Because the lava intrusion is still active and earthquakes are still occurring, we still think there’s a decent chance of new eruptive activity at the surface,” Steven Brantley said. \n \n Authorities on Thursday completed the removal of highly flammable chemicals from a nearby geothermal power plant that was in the path of creeping lava. \n \n The latest upheaval at Kilauea began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed suddenly in a cloud of ash, triggering a similar plunge in the molten lake inside the larger crater at the volcano’s summit. \n \n What followed was a flurry of earthquakes as huge volumes of magma — the term for lava beneath the surface — drained back through deep-underground passages that carried the molten rock far downslope. The lava then forced its way back to the surface through large cracks, or fissures, that opened at ground level in a residential area miles (km) away. \n \n (GRAPHIC: Scorched earth - tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS) \n \n ‘BALLISTIC BLOCKS’ \n \n Geologists said Kilauea may be entering a new phase of explosive eruptions not seen in nearly a century that could hurl “ballistic blocks” weighing up to 12 tons for half a mile (800 meters), and rain pebble-sized fragments for another mile or two (1.8 to 3.2 km). \n \n Deposits are seen on a road in Puna, Hawaii. Apau Hawaii Tours/via REUTERS \n \n However, the immediate vicinity around the summit, an area controlled by the National Park Service, was to be closed to visitors indefinitely, starting on Thursday night. \n \n Such blasts would likely also eject plumes of volcanic ash that could be carried farther downwind into neighboring communities, creating a nuisance and potential respiratory irritant, but not a life-threatening hazard, officials said. \n \n The Leilani Estates community remains in greatest danger, with 15 volcanic fissures so far having destroyed 36 structures, most of them homes, and forcing the evacuation of about 2,000 residents. \n \n But as the eruption progresses, “other areas of the lower East Rift Zone may also be at risk,” the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said in a bulletin. \n \n “There is the potential for additional outbreaks,” Christina Neal, the chief scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory at Kilauea told a news briefing. “There are other communities, other residential neighborhoods that could, depending on the evolution of activity, be in harm’s way.” \n \n Hawaii Governor David Ige has requested federal disaster assistance as he said a mass evacuation of the lower Puna District, where Leilani Estates is located, would be beyond current county and state capabilities. \n \n Hawaii police said they arrested Alexandru Stingu-Dragomir, 29, on suspicion he burgled four houses in Leilani Estates after the mayor declared an emergency the area on last week. \n \n SURFING IN THE VOG \n \n Local meteorologists said the change in prevailing winds could send Kilauea’s volcanic smog, or vog, northwest to Maui and other islands in Hawaii. \n \n Surfers bobbing in the ocean off Kona on the west side of the Big Island complained of the smog that could be seen in a haze over the coast. \n \n “Does that hat protect against vog?” one surfer was heard quipping to another about the floppy sun hat he was wearing. \n \n In Pahoa, the nearest village to Kilauea, some schools remained closed after the area was hit by a 6.9 magnitude earthquake on Friday, the biggest since 1975. \n \n Lava advances towards a metal barrier in Puna, May 6, 2018.

In addition, acid rain damages vegetation and causes tools, barbed-wire fencing and items that can rust to do so a lot faster. \n \n Light winds may allow volcanic haze to become more widespread on the Big Island through Friday night, but weather forecasters said there did not appear to be enough southeast flow to carry the vog to other islands. By late Friday night or Saturday morning, tradewinds should be back, helping to push the vog out to sea. \n \n The primary pollutants in vog, or volcanic smog, are sulfur dioxide gas and fine particulate matter. \n \n The American Lung Association warned the public that sulfur dioxide can have harmful effects on the lungs and cause respiratory problems. Sulfur dioxide irritates the nose, throat and airways to cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or a tight feeling around the chest — and can trigger asthma attacks. \n \n The effects of sulfur dioxide can be felt very quickly, according to the association, and are especially harmful to children, older adults and people with respiratory conditions. \n \n A two-person team from the Hawaii and Arizona National Guards monitored air quality near fissures in Leilani Estates Wednesday and found no dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide. \n \n Sgt. Milo Kalama of the Hawaii National Guard’s 93rd Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team approached a steaming fissure on Leilani Avenue wearing a black, full-face mask. As his air-monitoring equipment buzzed, Kalama removed his mask and declared the air quality normal. \n \n Kau Hospital and Rural Health Clinic reported an uptick in the number of patients with respiratory illness in the emergency room and clinic. \n \n “They’re having difficulty breathing and respiratory issues. It’s starting in Kau,” said hospital spokeswoman Elena Cabatu. “People please continue to heed civil defense warnings and read up on the precautions they can take. We’re definitely monitoring our supplies very closely and taking inventory of respiratory therapy supplies. We’re making sure we’re stocked so we’re ready to go.” \n \n Hilo Medical Center, however, has not seen an increase in respiratory patients, she said. \n \n The state Health Department has placed sulfur dioxide and particulate monitoring equipment around the eruption site. Once it is up and running, air quality data from the site will become available online. \n \n Honolulu Star-Advertiser writers Dan Nakaso and Kristen Consillio contributed to this report.', 'Evacuee Jon Warner, left, walks through rain with son Ethan, right, and daughter Iris after picking up some basic necessities at a makeshift donation center Tuesday, May 8, 2018, in Pahoa, Hawaii.

If he wins the presidency and the Senate re-election bid, he would relinquish his Senate seat. \n \n If he loses the presidential election but wins the Senate re-election race, he would become a second-term U.S. senator from Kentucky. \n \n Since winning his election in 2010, Mr. Paul has argued for creating term limits so members of Congress could serve a maximum of 12 years in each chamber. \n \n Mr. Paul and his office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.

His fellow Kentucky Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, faces a serious challenge from the political right in his own party. \n \n If Mr. McConnell falls to the tea party candidate in the May primary or if a Democrat defeats Mr. McConnell in November, then Mr. Paul would become the senior U.S. senator from Kentucky.

I hope he does.” \n \n Thayer denied that the caucus’ consideration of the idea was in exchange for Senate GOP support of House Bill 70, which would automatically restore voting rights for some felons -- an issue that has become a cornerstone as of late in Paul’s remodeling of the GOP brand in an effort to broaden the party’s base. \n \n Thayer says he will decide whether to file the bill by this Wednesday, when the filing window for introducing bills in the 2014 General Assembly expires. \n \n Paul, who is rumored to be a GOP frontrunner in the 2016 presidential race, has not officially announced his intention to seek higher office.', 'Rand Paul\'s flirtation with running for president is getting serious: he\'s asking Kentucky\'s senate to file a bill that would allow him to run for both the U.S. Senate and president in 2016. \n \n Kentucky\'s current law says a candidate\'s name cannot appear on a ballot more than once, which would seemingly force him to choose which office he wants to pursue rather than hedging his bets by running for both. \n \n State Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer told the Washington Times: ""Yes, I am working on clarifying an ambiguous state law that Rand Paul believes is unconstitutional if it is interpreted to bar running for re-election to the Senate and for president at the same time."" \n \n According to WFPL, Paul brought the issue up to the state Senate\'s Republican caucus last month. \n \n ""He is running for the U.S. Senate in 2016, but that he is strongly considering seeking the Republican nomination for President,"" Thayer told WFPL.

It would also show that he doesn\'t have much faith in winning the presidency. That said, several people have run for vice president and Congress at the same time, including Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. \n \n Rand Paul is not reportedly considering a run for the House of Representatives, although if he\'s going to run for president and Senate at the same time, he might as well go for the hat-trick.']",3,"– Oh, the difficulties faced by Rand Paul: He's considering running for president in 2016 but would like to run for re-election to the US Senate at the same time, just in case, and he's not sure Kentucky law currently allows him to do so.

Current state law says a candidate's name cannot appear on a ballot more than once, the Wire explains. ""Yes, I am working on clarifying an ambiguous state law that Rand Paul believes is unconstitutional if it is interpreted to bar running for re-election to the Senate and for president at the same time,"" the majority leader, Damon Thayer, confirms. ""The purpose of the bill will be to make clear that Rand Paul or anyone in a similar situation in Kentucky can run for both offices in the same year.""

101,"['It’s any barbecue-lover’s worst nightmare: You go to bed after enjoying a juicy burger or a smoky rack of ribs, only to awaken, covered in sweat and hives. You’ve become allergic to meat. An increasing number of meat lovers in the United States and around the world have had this horrific experience in recent years, and it’s all because of a tiny parasite. \n \n The culprit, the Lone Star Tick, spreads this potentially life-threatening allergy through its bites. Researchers don’t know exactly how the tick spreads the allergy, but they have identified which component of meat causes the allergic reaction. Mammal meat — pork and beef — contains a sugar called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal for short), and in people with the allergy, alpha-gal triggers an immune response that includes a massive release of histamines, much like your body would respond to other allergies. \n \n Wired reported that in 2004, University of Virginia immunologist Thomas Platts-Mills, Ph.D., identified the alpha-gal connection after examining blood work from people that experienced strange reactions not to meat but to a cancer drug called cetuximab. People in the southeastern U.S., they found, were 10 times more likely to be allergic to this effective cancer drug. Further investigation showed that the region was also home to people with meat allergies. Since cetuximab and mammal meat both contain alpha-gal, and the affected people’s blood contained alpha-gal antibodies, the researchers hypothesized that the sugar was behind the allergy. \n \n Most scientists agree that allergies occur when a foreign allergen — like alpha-gal — is mistakenly marked as an invader by the antibodies of the body’s immune system, which then releases chemical weapons to destroy it. One of those weapons is histamine, which triggers the inflammation necessary to deal with the allergen — but also causes the rest of your body to swell up, as well. \n \n Since cases of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which is spread by the Lone Star Tick, also arise in the same southeastern region, researchers are pretty sure that it’s the tick bites that are causing the allergies to meat and cetuximab. While the details of the allergy-spreading mechanism have yet to be understood, they’re likely involved in priming the body’s immune system to react badly to alpha-gal invasions. \n \n As far as scientists know, this condition is lifelong. Unfortunately, the reaction is life-threatening, too, as anaphylaxis can cause a person’s airway to swell shut. \n \n These cases have previously occurred mostly in the southern, southeastern, and central U.S., reports of new meat allergies have surfaced in the northeast, including Pennsylvania and New York. It’s unclear whether this means that the tick’s range is spreading or whether the ability to confer this allergy has spread to other tick species. \n \n Original Could Kratom Solve the Opioid Crisis? \n \n If you want to avoid developing this allergy, take basic precautions when going out in the woods or high grass. Check yourself thoroughly when you get home, especially in your body’s folds and near waistbands or elastic parts of clothes. And if you experience sweating, itching, or difficulty breathing a few hours after you eat meat, seek immediate medical attention.', 'First comes the unscratchable itching, and the angry blossoming of hives. Then stomach cramping, and—for the unluckiest few—difficulty breathing, passing out, and even death. In the last decade and a half, thousands of previously protein-loving Americans have developed a dangerous allergy to meat. And they all have one thing in common: the lone star tick. \n \n Red meat, you might be surprised to know, isn’t totally sugar-free. It contains a few protein-linked saccharides, including one called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, or alpha-gal, for short. More and more people are learning this the hard way, when they suddenly develop a life-threatening allergy to that pesky sugar molecule after a tick bite. \n \n Yep, one bite from the lone star tick—which gets its name from the Texas-shaped splash of white on its back—is enough to reprogram your immune system to forever reject even the smallest nibble of perfectly crisped bacon. For years, physicians and researchers only reported the allergy in places the lone star tick calls home, namely the southeastern United States. But recently it’s started to spread. The newest hot spots? Duluth, Minnesota, Hanover, New Hampshire, and the eastern tip of Long Island, where at least 100 cases have been reported in the last year. Scientists are racing to trace its spread, to understand if the lone star tick is expanding into new territories, or if other species of ticks are now causing the allergy. \n \n The University of Virginia is deep in the heart of lone star tick country. It’s also home to a world-class allergy research division, headed up by immunologist Thomas Platts-Mills. He’d been hearing tales of the meat allergy since the ’90s—people waking up in the middle of the night after a big meal, sweating and breaking out in hives. But he didn’t give it much thought until 2004, when he heard about another group of patients all suffering from the same symptoms. \n \n This time, it wasn’t a plate of pork chops they shared; it was a new cancer drug called cetuximab. The drug worked, but curiously, patients that lived in the southeast were 10 times as likely to report side effects of itching, swelling, and a dangerous drop in blood pressure. \n \n Platts-Mills teamed up with cetuximab’s distributor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and began comparing patient blood samples. He discovered that all the patients who experienced an allergic reaction had pre-existing antibodies to alpha-gal, and cetuximab was full of the stuff, thanks to the genetically modified mice from which it was derived. With that mystery solved, Platts-Mills turned to figuring out what made patients so sensitive to alpha-gal. \n \n The best hint he had was the geographic overlap between the cetuximab patients and previously reported meat allergies. The area perfectly matched where people came down with Rocky Mountain spotted fever—a disease carried by the lone star tick. But it wasn’t until Platts-Mills and two of his lab members came down with tick-induced meat allergies of their own that they made the connection. \n \n Over the next few years Platts-Mills and his colleague Scott Commins screened more meat allergy patients and discovered that 80 percent reported being bitten by a tick. What’s more, they showed that tick bites led to a 20-fold increase in alpha-gal antibodies. Since ethics standards prevented them from attaching ticks to randomized groups of patients, this data was the best they could do to guess how meat allergy arises. Something in the tick’s saliva hijacks humans’ immune systems, red-flagging alpha-gal, and triggering the massive release of histamines whenever red meat is consumed. \n \n Researchers are still trying to find what that something is. Commins has since moved to the University of North Carolina, where he’s injecting mice with lone star tick extracts to try to understand which molecules are setting off the alpha-gal bomb. It’s tricky: Tick saliva is packed with tons of bioactive compounds to help the parasite feed without detection. One of them might be an alpha-gal analogue—something similar-but-different-enough in shape that it sets off the human immune system. But it could also be a microbe—like a bacteria or virus—that triggers the response. Some have even suggested that residual proteins from the ticks’ earlier blood meals could be the culprit. \n \n Whatever it is, allergy researchers will be paying attention. Because, as far as anyone can tell, alpha-gal syndrome seems to be the only allergy that affects all people, regardless of genetic makeup. “There’s something really special about this tick,” says Jeff Wilson, an asthma, allergy, and immunology fellow in Platts-Mills’ group. Usually a mix of genes and environmental factors combine to create allergies. But when it comes to the lone star tick it doesn’t matter if you’re predisposed or not. “Just a few bites and you can render anyone really, really allergic,” he says. \n \n In the meantime, Platts-Mills, Commins, and Wilson are busy communicating the scale of the public health problem. Every day they check local news headlines to log new cases of catastrophic hamburger aversion, and spend hours on the phone gathering the latest intel from allergy clinics and academic centers around the country. They’re building the first real red meat allergy incidence map of the US—because state health departments aren’t required to report alpha-gal syndrome to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it’s still rare enough outside the southeastern US that many doctors don’t correctly diagnose it. \n \n Wilson is trying to get blood samples from all the new outbreaks, to figure out if the patients’ antibodies correspond to the saliva of lone star ticks or a different tick species. That will tell him if the increases in the allergy are the result of changing range patterns, or if other ticks have developed the capacity to rewire human immune systems in the same way. That information would also provide further clues to the mechanism itself. As for a cure? There’s not much science has to offer on that front, besides Epipens and veggie burgers.']",2,"– Ticks are out in force this year, and there's one species in particular you should watch out for if you'd ever like to eat meat again. Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern US. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as Lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern US, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports Wired. Cases—in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death—have been reported in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New York, per Inverse. Long Island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, ""the nuisance level [for lone star ticks] is much higher than the black-legged tick,"" an expert tells the Weston Forum. ""It is aggressive and very abundant."" Researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy. (A toddler died after a tick bite.)"

Since battles usually have a place and a date, it would be nice to import this data into a data design in nodegoat and visualise these battles through time and space (diachronic geospatiality ftw). \n \n So we checked the Wikidata sparql-endpoint to see what we can work with. Currently, there are 8049 instances of battles . If we select all the battles that have a location and a date, we are left with 410 battles. This query does not take into account that the location may be stored on a deeper level (as these battles may have a ‘place’ that has a location) and that the date may be stored as a ‘start time’ and ‘end time’.

104,"['NASA is asking everyday terrestrials to come up with cosmic solutions to a very down-to-earth problem: how to deal with human waste when you’re trapped in a space suit for up to a week. \n \n The American space agency has launched a competition for participants to invent a hands-free system that routes and collects waste away from the astronaut’s body for up to six days. Inventors have the chance of winning $30,000, and have until Dec. 20 to submit their best “space poop” ideas. \n \n “I can tell you that space flight is not always glamorous,” said astronaut Rick Mastracchio, a veteran of Space Shuttle Soyuz, and Space Station missions speaking in a video promoting NASA’s call to action. “People need to go to the bathroom even in a spacecraft.” \n \n During spaceflight astronauts can be in their suits for more than 10 hours at a time. But with NASA planning on sending humans deeper into space, future missions will require the advancement of new technology to keep the astronauts alive and well. \n \n Currently, crews wear an absorbent diaper but these would not be suitable for flights longer than a day, according to a description on the contest’s website HeroX. While it goes without saying that nobody in their right mind would want to wear a diaper for a week, the issue is more than a matter of squeamishness, it’s a matter of life or death. \n \n Mastracchio said it is vital that the waste needs to be treated otherwise it could harm or even kill the astronaut. “Given enough time, infection, and even sepsis can set in. This is the problem we are asking you to help us with.” \n \n NASA said it aims to test the winning ideas in the next year and roll out successful systems in the next three.', 'NASA vowed to award up to three $30,000 prizes for the most promising in-suit waste management systems When you\'ve got to go, but you\'re out there in space, zipped up in a spacesuit, with no toilet in sight and a crew of other astronauts around, what do you do? \n \n NASA has launched a contest for inventors to solve this uncomfortable issue, and promises to award $30,000 to the best ""space poop"" solutions. \n \n Inventors have until December 20 to submit designs for a personalized waste-wicking system that will handle everything, hands-free, for a period of up to six days. \n \n ""The old standby solution consisted of diapers,"" said the description of contest details at www.herox.com/SpacePoop. \n \n ""However, the diaper is only a very temporary solution, and doesn\'t provide a healthy/protective option longer than one day."" \n \n Sometimes, astronauts have to wait even longer. The two men and one woman who packed themselves into a Russian Soyuz space capsule last week had to wait two full days between launching from Kazakhstan and arriving at the International Space Station. \n \n The Soyuz is equipped with a portable toilet, which looks like an air-powered pee jug. \n \n On future missions to deep space destinations like an asteroid or Mars, NASA suspects it could take up to 144 hours, or six days, to get to a proper toilet. \n \n In emergency situations, astronauts may need to zip themselves into a fully pressurized, bulky orange spacesuit, complete with helmet and gloves. \n \n ""While sealed, it is impossible for an astronaut to access their own body, even to scratch their nose,"" NASA said. \n \n That\'s where the inventors come in. Astronauts need some way to clear away urine, fecal matter and menstrual blood efficiently, or they risk infection. \n \n The problem is that in weightlessness, fluids can blob up and stick to surfaces, while solids float in the air. \n \n ""You don\'t want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,"" NASA said, recalling how easy babies can get diaper rash. \n \n Currently, while at the International Space Station, astronauts use a toilet contraption that includes a vacuum and a tube to help evacuate fecal matter. \n \n To urinate, they use a funnel attached to a hose that can be adapted for a sitting or standing position, and uses air to move urine away. \n \n NASA vowed to award up to three $30,000 prizes for the most promising in-suit waste management systems. \n \n The goal is to test them within a year and fully implement them within three years. \n \n NASA says the first human missions to Mars could take place by the 2030s. \n \n Explore further: Soyuz capsule docks with International Space Station', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

But that’s just it -- we have to consider that issue. So before you go running off to make space travel history by drumming up new solutions, let’s talk about the current situation in space. \n \n \n \n There are two space-age toilets on the ISS, located in the Tranquility and Zvezda modules. The second commode was put in just a few years ago, after the first unit was having some problems. Effectively managing human waste is critical for the health and safety of astronauts in space. \n \n \n \n Our terrestrial toilets use gravity to flush everything away, but doing your business in the weightlessness of outer space gets tricky. \n \n So, how exactly does one go number one, or number two, in space? \n \n The Amazing Zero-G John \n \n The toilets on the ISS are so different from yours, astronauts actually need some supplemental potty training to figure them out. And they're astronauts. \n \n Without getting into the nitty-gritty, let’s just say that relieving oneself in space these days is a lot better than it used to be. Today, going to the restroom in zero-g is a quick process, but it looks more complicated than using a car. Luckily, they get to practice on training toilets before blastoff (pun intended). \n \n There seem to be a lot of steps involved, so you probably don't want to be in a hurry. Liquid and solid waste are handled differently: there's a somewhat normal-looking toilet seat, along with what's known as a “urine hose.” \n \n The hole in the toilet seat is smaller than usual, so apparently, it can be a bit tough to get the alignment right at first. Women and men are equal here when it comes to number two, using the same setup, but urinating requires different … attachments. \n \n Space toilets use suction instead of gravity, for both urine and solid waste. You don't really sit in space, because you don't weight anything, so astronauts need to either strap themselves in or use handles to hold themselves down. \n \n You can actually check out a guided tour of the toilet cabin on the ISS, given by Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti: \n \n Out of Sight, Out of Mind? \n \n On Earth, we get to flush our waste away and never see it again (unless something goes horribly wrong). But on the ISS, it's not that simple. \n \n Urine and solid waste are collected and dealt with separately. Urine and other waste water goes through a very advanced filtration and purification process, before it ends up being used again for - you guessed it - drinking water. In case you needed more proof, the space program really isn’t for the faint of heart. Think you could swing it? Before you answer, you should also know that the water they end up drinking is actually purer than the water most of us drink on a daily basis. I guess that's worth the view. \n \n Solid waste ends up getting packed up, compressed and sent off to burn up in the atmosphere like a shooting star. Make a wish! \n \n Astronauts try to take care of all their business on the space station, rather than in their spacesuits. But when nature calls on a spacewalk, they have to use the equivalent of an adult diaper for space travelers. \n \n Wearing a diaper is a reasonable solution for short term waste management for launch, reentry, and spacewalks, but future long distance missions might require astronauts to remain in a protective suit for up to 6 days. That’s a long time no matter how you slice it, and a diaper is simply not a safe or sustainable waste management tool. NASA is working on this challenge themselves, but as we prepare our species for interplanetary travel, they could use some help from the crowd with these kinds of details! \n \n The Space Poop Challenge \n \n As hard as it is for astronauts to use the toilet in the pressurized environments like ISS, it is an even bigger challenge when you have to wear a spacesuit (particularly if you have to wear it for more than a few hours), This is why the Space Poop Challenge is offering up to $30,000 for the best ideas to create a system that will collect waste and route it away from an astronaut's body, hands-free, while wearing a spacesuit. Check out the Space Poop Challenge page to learn more, get registered, and take your place in the annals of space travel history!"", 'NASA has initiated a ""Space Poop Challenge,"" and is calling on innovators to come up with new designs for a spacesuit waste management system. \n \n Sometimes the ""call of nature"" is really urgent – and if you\'re in a spacesuit, you can\'t easily rush to the bathroom. \n \n That\'s why NASA has created the ""Space Poop Challenge."" The agency is asking innovators to create fecal, urine and menstrual management systems for spacesuits, that would work for up to six days. Up to $30,000 in prize money is up for grabs. \n \n NASA astronauts wear diapers to take care of their bodily needs while they\'re launching, landing or spacewalking. However, these diapers are only good for a few hours; sitting in poop, urine or menstrual fluid for more than that is bad for your health, and your backside, besides. [How to Pee in Space (and What to Do If the Toilet Breaks)] \n \n ""Future missions may require long-duration waste management for use by a pressurized suited crew member,"" NASA wrote in a statement on HeroX, a website where people or organizations can host incentive-based competitions. \n \n ""In the event of cabin depressurization or other contingency, crew members may need to take refuge in their launch and entry suits for a long-duration: 144 hours,"" according to the statement. ""The crew member will have less than 60 minutes to get into and seal their spacesuit. To ensure the crew member\'s safety, the solution [proposed system] needs to take no more than five minutes [to set up and integrate with the spacesuit]."" \n \n Further complicating the challenge is the requirement that the system work in microgravity, in a pressurized spacesuit. This means would-be designers need to contend with floating water and debris that everybody really, really wants to keep far away from human orifices or vital spacesuit systems. \n \n The new system will be designed for NASA\'s Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit, an improvement on the orange spacesuit used for shuttle launches and landings. That suit is expected to be used by astronauts on the Orion spacecraft. \n \n The submission deadline for the Space Poop Challenge is Dec. 20, and winners will be announced Jan. 31, 2017. You can see all the guidelines and rules on this website. https://herox.com/SpacePoop/ \n \n Follow Elizabeth Howell @howellspace, or Space.com @Spacedotcom. We\'re also on Facebook and Google+. Original article on Space.com.', 'Challenge Overview \n \n The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) seeks proposed solutions for urine, fecal and menstrual management systems to be used in the crew’s launch and entry suits over a continuous duration of up to 144 hours. An in-suit waste management system would be beneficial for contingency scenarios or for any long duration tasks. \n \n Waste management systems should address fecal, urine, and/or menstrual waste management in a pressurized survival suit environment for six days while protecting the safety and health of crew members. Solutions should provide for urine collection of up to 1L per day per crew member, for a total of 6 days. Fecal collection rates should be targeted for 75 grams of fecal mass and 75 mL fecal volume per crewmember per day for a total of 6 days duration. Menstrual collection systems should handle up to 80 mL over 6 days. \n \n NASA will award the Solutions it judges to be the most promising for implementation and use on missions in the next three or four years. NASA will consider collaborating with winners and/or other competitors, subject to NASA rules and regulations for contract procurement. \n \n Background \n \n Spaceflight launch and entry suits are worn for launch and entry activities to protect the crew from any off-nominal events. Up until now, a crew member could be in their launch and entry suit for more than 10 hours at a time leading up to either a launch or landing scenario, and former astronauts have worn diapers in case they need to relieve themselves. The diaper is only used temporarily until the crew has successfully launched from or returned to Earth. It is eventually removed along with the launch and entry suit. \n \n Future missions may require long-duration waste management for use by a pressurized suited crew member. In the event of cabin depressurization or other contingency, crew members may need to take refuge in their launch and entry suits for a long-duration (144-hour). The crew member will have less than 60 minutes to get into and seal their spacesuit. To ensure the crew member’s safety, the Solution needs to take no more than 5 minutes of that time. The crew member will remain in their suit at a pressure of 4.3 PSID and in 100% oxygen environment, with a few tasks to complete inside the depressurized vehicle prior to vehicle. A system to route and collect human waste away from the body without the use of hands, that operates in the prescribed environment, is being sought to keep astronauts alive and healthy over 144 hours. \n \n Current commercial products that provide urine waste management utilize gravity to route and collect urine away from the body. Some require the use of hands, and most are not meant to be used for 144 hours. No commercial products have been found that provide fecal waste management for a 144-hour period with or without the use of hands. While the implemented Solution can be discarded after each mission, it does have to function well for 6 days and multiple bowel and bladder evacuations. \n \n ABOUT POOPING IN SPACE…. \n \n This challenge does not require you to be working in a field involving microgravity or to fully understand how the body and fluids work in a microgravity environment. We are going to tell you a bit about what ‘s different. \n \n First, microgravity is what you might call “Zero Gravity”. Think vacuum. In a vacuum, solids, liquids and gases do not act the way they do on earth, where they are influenced by earth’s gravity. You probably have no problem imagining things floating around in space. Yes, sometimes solids, liquids, and gases do this. But they also might cling to the nearest surface due to surface tension. Imagine taking a shower up in space and having a glob of water under your armpit. Also, on earth, solids and liquids would likely mix together at least a little when in contact. Maybe not in microgravity. \n \n As for your bodily functions. Well, in space there is no gravity to direct your urine away from your body when you release it. Same for poop. There is no gravity to pull it away when you release it. Menstrual fluid? At least some of it will exit a woman’s body. You don’t want that traveling around your suit. And don’t forget, you can’t always count on poop being solid, especially if you are up in space and nervous about the fact that your vehicle cabin has depressurized. \n \n You don’t want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for 6 days. If you have ever taken care of a baby, you know how easy it is to get diaper rash. Left untreated, that can turn into a dangerous infection. You don’t want fecal matter getting into the urethra or the vagina, causing urinary tract or vaginal infections. Of course, you don’t want them to migrate to mouth, nose, ears or cuts. The point? Your Solution has to keep all of these materials away from the body, its orifices, and the spacesuit air inlet/outlet orifices. \n \n How has NASA handled this in the past? Well, for one thing, they weren’t handling it for 6 days. Maybe a few hours. In the recent past, astronauts have worn an extremely absorbent adult diaper. Most of the time the diaper is there for emergencies. Prior to that, men wore Urine Collection and Transfer Assembly (UCTA) and Fecal Collection Systems (FCS). Women have never had anything besides the adult diaper while wearing a suit. When not wearing a suit, but within the vehicle, women had a choice of 3 versions of cup-type urine collection systems that used air flow to effectively cause urine to swirl away from a woman’s body. No matter how you look at it, getting rid of wastes has been complicated, crude, uncomfortable, and messy, even with the use of hands. And now we are saying that you don’t have use of your hands – at least not inside the suit next to your body. \n \n ABOUT THE SPACE SUIT \n \n You will design a solution that can be incorporated into the orange Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit (MACES). MACES has been adapted for missions of longer duration than the original Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) was designed for. \n \n The whole suit, including the gloves, is pressurized to 4.3 PSID to enable the body to function properly. Without pressure the body swells, loses most of its circulation, and of course, causes extreme pain. The gloves are attached by metal bearings to the sleeves to ensure a proper seal. Once the suit is sealed, it must remain sealed until the astronaut enters another pressurized environment. While sealed, it is impossible for an astronaut to access their own body, even to scratch their nose. \n \n Gas (100% oxygen) enters at 4.5 cubic feet per minute through a waist level connector to fill the 2” space between the astronaut’s body and the suit, and circulates out through another waist level connector to be cleaned and brought back to the suit. A mesh cover protects against particles getting into the air connectors. If they did get inside, they could easily block the flow of air. \n \n This gas supply is clearly a very precious commodity. While a very small amount is lost to leakage, the Solution must not add to this leakage. However, careful use of 1000 cubic centimeters per minute (0.01 cubic feet per minute) over a period of 3 minutes per use would not jeopardize the integrity of the suit. \n \n The suit allows the astronauts to move around, get into tight spaces, and sit down and buckle up for long periods of time. Your Solution should be comfortable in all of these situations. \n \n Finally, a small power sources of up to 28V with current below 100mA could be provided inside or outside of the suit. \n \n To learn more about the functionality of space suits in general, see NASA’s What is a Space Suit and Wikipedia’s Space Suit. To read the detailed specifications of the MACES, click here. \n \n PLANS FOR THE WINNING SOLUTIONS \n \n NASA is ideally looking for Solutions that are comprised of technologies at a minimum Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of level 4, such that the Solution can be tested within 1 year and fully implemented within 3 years. However, for breakthrough innovations, NASA will consider Solutions that are at a lower TRL and therefore a longer implementation timeline. \n \n NASA will consider collaborating with winners and/or other competitors, subject to NASA rules and regulations for contract procurement. \n \n Prizes \n \n The challenge offers up to $30,000 USD in prizes to innovative solutions for long duration waste management in a microgravity environment. NASA will award up to three prizes for the best ideas. \n \n NASA will award the Solutions it judges to be the most promising for implementation and use on missions in the next three or four years. \n \n How do I win? \n \n To be eligible for an award, the solution must, at minimum: \n \n Keep urine and/or fecal waste away from a crew member’s body for a minimum of 144 hours while in a space suit \n \n Operate in a microgravity scenario \n \n Operate within a full launch and entry suit at an internal pressure of 4.3 PSID and 100% oxygen environment which cannot be opened for manual access within the 144 hour time period \n \n Operate while a crew member is moving, bending, and/or seated and strapped into a chair \n \n Manage at least one of the three following human wastes for up to 6 days Manage up to 1L per day of urine per crew member (based on planned liquid intake during mission) Manage up to 75 grams of fecal mass and 75mL fecal volume per crew member (based on planned food intake during mission).

Tolda / Special to the Sun \n \n WHERE SHE CHANGED Angle softened her rhetoric on phasing out Social Security and retreated from statements about people exercising “Second Amendment remedies” if conservatives don’t prevail this year. \n \n WHERE SHE DIDN'T Angle held firm in opposing extension of unemployment benefits. She also restated her opposition to abortion, saying government should not have gotten involved in the issue. \n \n Sun coverage More Sun politics stories \n \n In her first mainstream media interview since winning the Republican nomination in the U.S. Senate race, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle softened her rhetoric on “phasing out” Social Security and fearing the electorate would take up arms if conservatives didn’t win at the ballot box. \n \n But on other issues, such as abortion and her belief that unemployment benefits deter the jobless from applying for work, she stridently defended herself amid criticism from her Democratic rival, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, that her views are “wacky” and “dangerous.” \n \n In a raucous 30-minute interview on “Face to Face With Jon Ralston,” Angle was pressed to explain the positions she took during the Republican primary to a general election audience, as well as to a cadre of political observers waiting to see how much she will change now that she faces a major Democrat for the first time in her political career. \n \n Only once did she flatly admit her pre-primary language was too strong, when asked to explain her comments that the citizenry will resort to “Second Amendment remedies” — referring to the right to bear arms — if conservatives didn’t win this election. \n \n “I admit it was a little strong to say,” she said. “That’s why I changed my rhetoric to ‘defeat Harry Reid.’ ” \n \n She also appeared to moderate her belief that the Social Security program should be “phased out.” Far from advocating an end to the program, she said existing benefits should be protected, more money should be put into the system and, in the future, younger workers should be given the choice between a “personal account” and Social Security benefits. \n \n But when it came to one of the most severe problems facing Nevada, the 14 percent unemployment rate that is higher than any other state’s, Angle stuck to her view that unemployment benefits should no longer be extended. \n \n Instead, she said jobs exist that those on benefits should be taking. \n \n “They keep extending unemployment benefits to the point where people are afraid to go out and get a job because the job doesn’t pay as much as the benefit,” Angle said. “There are jobs that do exist.” \n \n Unemployment benefits should be reworked to supplement lower wages, rather than being eliminated once a job is found, she argued. \n \n She vehemently restated her view that a “system of entitlements” has “spoiled our citizenry.” \n \n Angle also worked to stay true to her core conservative beliefs on social issues. She said the separation of church and state is a doctrine meant to “protect the church” and that elected officials should “bring our values to the political system.” She sidestepped her comments from the 1990s that the separation of church and state is an “unconstitutional doctrine.” \n \n After the interview Reid spokesman Jon Summer commented, “For someone who talks so much about the Constitution, you would think she would actually know what is in it. It’s shocking to hear her say that the separation of church and state isn’t part of the Constitution, when it is laid out in the First Amendment.” \n \n The interview itself was significant because while Angle has been available to conservative talk shows, she has been viewed as evading mainstream news organizations. \n \n When Ralston challenged her comments to a Reno conservative talk show host that abortion should not be available even in the case of rape or incest, Angle said she values life. \n \n “You want government to go and tell a 13-year-old child who’s been raped by her father she has to have that baby?” Ralston asked. \n \n “I didn’t say that,” she said. “I always say that I value life.” \n \n She went further to say she believes government should stay out of the issue of abortion, but it decided to insert its control after the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. \n \n “The government decided to get involved in this, not me,” she said. “I’m just defending my position.” \n \n When she was in the Legislature, Angle repeatedly sponsored a bill that would require the “dissemination of information concerning the scientific link between induced abortion and increased rate of breast cancer.” \n \n Concerning Yucca Mountain, Angle said she believes the state should abandon its decades-old fight to keep the federal government from burying the nation’s most radioactive waste 90 miles outside of Las Vegas. \n \n “We need to make lemonade out of lemons,” she said, arguing jobs could be created by accepting the waste. \n \n Throughout the interview, Angle tried to pivot to attacking Reid, blaming him for the high unemployment rate, expanding the federal deficit and bailing out big businesses. \n \n “We’re nitpicking on all of these little topics that Harry Reid has thrown out there,” she said. “I would like to see Harry Reid come into this studio and have a real debate on the issues. And the issues to me are the high unemployment, the high foreclosure rate and the high bankruptcy rate.”""]",7,"– Pooping in space ""isn't glamorous, but it is necessary for survival,"" an astronaut explains—yet it's presenting quite a challenge for NASA. See, while the International Space Station has a pretty fancy toilet, an astronaut must wear a diaper during launch and landing activities or while spacewalking. But as NASA looks toward future missions in deep space, it's also looking for a way for astronauts to relieve themselves while remaining in their space suits for up to six days, reports Time. That's where you come in. The agency is offering a $30,000 prize in a ""space poop challenge"" if someone can create ""a system inside a space suit that collects human waste for up to 144 hours and routes it away from the body, without the use of hands."" There are plenty of stipulations. For example, the system ""needs to take no more than five minutes [to set up]"" as an astronaut might be forced to jump into their suit quickly in an emergency, per Space.com. While such a challenge might seem humorous, a solution ""could be the difference between life and death,"" notes the contest website. ""You don't want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,"" NASA adds in a release. ""Given enough time, infection, and even sepsis can set in,"" says astronaut Rick Mastracchio in a video. Inventors have until Dec. 20 to submit their entries. NASA plans to test the top entries next year, with a solution executed within three years. (A scientist thinks humans could get to Mars in a month.)"

106,"['The South Korean military says North Korea attempted to launch a missile on April 15, the birthday of the country’s ""eternal president,"" Kim Il Sung, but that it failed. (Reuters) \n \n North Korea tried but failed to launch an intermediate-range missile Friday, American and South Korean military officials said, dealing the regime an embarrassing blow on the most important day of the year on the North Korean calendar. \n \n To mark the 104th anniversary of the birthday of the country’s ""eternal president,"" Kim Il Sung, North Korea launched a missile from its east coast at about 5:30 a.m. local time. But it deviated from a ""normal"" trajectory, an official from South Korea\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters in Seoul. \n \n “North Korea appears to have tried a missile launch from the East Sea [Sea of Japan] area early morning today, but it is presumed to have failed,” the official said. \n \n But South Korea\'s military is still on high alert. ""We are preparing against the possibility that the North could carry out heavyweight provocations at any time, including the fifth nuclear test,"" a military official said, according to the Yonhap News Agency. \n \n [North Korea unveils homemade engine for missile capable of striking U.S.] \n \n A U.S. defense official said that the U.S. Strategic Command systems had also “detected and tracked” the missile. “We assess that the launch failed,” he said. \n \n Initial analysis suggested that the missile was a Musudan, also known as a BM-25, the kind that South Korean authorities had detected being moved Thursday near Wonsan on North Korea’s east coast. \n \n The Musudan is an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of traveling 1,500 to 2,500 miles — putting the U.S. territory of Guam within reach — and of carrying a 1.3-ton nuclear warhead, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \n \n North Korea has displayed the Musudan at its military parades and is believed to have supplied assembly kits for the missile to Iran, but it had never tested this model of missile before. \n \n \n \n Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California, said the failure would “reinforce the persistent denial” about North Korea’s capabilities. \n \n “But in fact, they will have learned a lot from this launch. Not as much as they would have learned if it had succeeded, but still something,” Lewis said. \n \n The Musudan uses the same sort of engine as the submarine-launched ballistic missile that North Korea tested last year but that also failed. \n \n “Clearly they have a problem, but maybe next time it will work. It took them a couple of launches to get the Taepodong-2 going,” Lewis said, referring to the ballistic-missile technology that has now put two North Korean satellites into orbit. \n \n At the same time, North Korea has been making a series of claims about technological advances, from building solid-fuel rocket engines to miniaturizing nuclear warheads. The regime recently claimed that it could send a \xadnuclear-tipped missile to the U.S. mainland. \n \n [North Korea claims it could wipe out Manhattan with a hydrogen bomb] \n \n Although this has not been proved, U.S. military officials and nonproliferation experts say that North Korea is clearly working toward this goal. The Musudan test could be part of this program. \n \n At a hearing of a Senate Armed Services subcommittee this week, Brian McKeon, a senior Pentagon official, said North Korea’s weapons and missile programs pose a growing threat to the United States and its allies in East Asia. \n \n North Korea is “seeking to develop longer-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons to the United States and continues efforts to bring [a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile] to operational capacity,” he said. \n \n Although an untested long-range missile was unlikely to be reliable, North Korea’s successful satellite launches showed it was mastering the technologies that would be needed, McKeon said. \n \n China’s official Xinhua News Agency said North Korea’s failed firing of a mid-range ballistic missile Friday was “the latest in a string of saber-rattling that, if unchecked, will lead the country to nowhere.” \n \n Since Kim Jong Un ordered his military to conduct a fourth nuclear test in January — which North Korea claimed was a hydrogen-bomb explosion, although outside experts are highly skeptical — there has been a steady stream of projectiles emanating from North Korea. \n \n 1 of 50 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × What life looks like inside North Korea View Photos Scenes from the hermit kingdom.

Security Council resolutions from launching ballistic missiles or carrying out nuclear tests, but it continues to do so. \n \n The international community has responded to North Korea’s latest provocations with tough sanctions aimed at cutting off the state’s ability to procure parts and finance its weapons-of-mass-destruction program. \n \n This push coincided with two-month-long drills between the U.S. and South Korean militaries, during which they are practicing their response to the collapse of North Korea. The drills, which conclude at the end of this month, include computer-simulated “decapitation strikes” on the North Korean leadership. \n \n Amid this background of heightened tensions, North Korea has been preparing for two key events — the anniversary of Kim Il Sung’s birth and the first congress of the communist Workers’ Party in 36 years. \n \n The country is in the grip of a “70-day campaign” to prepare for the congress, set for early next month. Analysts expect Kim Jong Un to use the event to bolster his legitimacy. \n \n Kim, who is 33, is not only incredibly young by the standards of Korea, where age is revered, but he also did not have the kind of long preparation and introduction that his father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, enjoyed. \n \n Read more: \n \n North Korea scolds Obama by adopting the voice of Abraham Lincoln \n \n What it’s like to be an American held in North Korea \n \n The weird world of North Korea’s restaurants abroad', ""SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea attempted and failed to launch what experts believe was an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Friday in defiance of U.N. sanctions and in an embarrassing setback for leader Kim Jong Un, drawing criticism from major ally China. \n \n North Korea leader Kim Jong Un smiles as he visits Sohae Space Center in Cholsan County, North Pyongan province for the testing of a new engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on April 9, 2016. REUTERS/KCNA \n \n The U.S. Defense Department called the test of the road-mobile missile, which came as North Korea celebrated the birthday of Kim’s grandfather and North Korea’s founding father Kim Il Sung, a “fiery, catastrophic” failure. \n \n The test, on North Korea’s so-called “Day of the Sun,” followed its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February, which led to new U.N. sanctions that have failed to halt Pyongyang’s weapons programs. \n \n South Korean officials and international experts said the failed test heightened the possibility that North Korea would conduct a fifth nuclear test, possibly within weeks. \n \n The U.S.-based 38 North website, which specializes in North Korea, said there has been activity at the country’s nuclear site based on satellite imagery and on Wednesday said the possibility of a fifth nuclear test “could not be ruled out.” \n \n U.S. officials said the missile tested on Friday never got off the launch pad but further tests were expected. \n \n “We’re still assessing the specifics of it but I can tell you that it was a fiery, catastrophic attempt at a launch,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told a briefing. “It was not successful.” \n \n Davis said the U.S. military thought the device was a road-mobile missile because the launch occurred at a coastal site where Pyongyang ordinarily does not test rockets. \n \n He said North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and often fires missiles during periods of tension, remained a security concern in spite of the failure. \n \n “We know that this is a capability that they are aiming towards,” he said. It’s ... a missile system that they’ve displayed on multiple occasions and that is why we have a ballistic missile defense system that we have invested in very heavily to be able to outpace that threat as that threat develops further.” \n \n CHINA ANGERED \n \n The White House strongly condemned the latest launch attempt and said Washington would work with China and other countries to put pressure on North Korea, which faced the prospect of further isolation. \n \n China, North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, has been angered by Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and rocket launches and has backed U.N. sanctions. \n \n “The firing of a mid-range ballistic missile on Friday by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), though failed, marks the latest in a string of saber-rattling that, if unchecked, will lead the country to nowhere,” China’s official Xinhua news agency said in an English language commentary. \n \n “... Nuclear weapons will not make Pyongyang safer. On the contrary, its costly military endeavors will keep on suffocating its economy.” \n \n Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the U.N. Security Council was clear on North Korean rocket launches. \n \n “At present, the situation on the peninsula is complex and sensitive,” he told reporters. “We hope all parties can strictly respect the decisions of the Security Council and avoid taking any steps that could further worsen tensions.” \n \n In 2012, Kim Il Sung’s birthday was also marked by an attempted long-range rocket launch, which also failed. \n \n The missile was likely a Musudan, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said, an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a design range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles) that can be fired from a road mobile launcher but which has never been flight-tested. \n \n Experts see North Korea’s Musudan test as part of an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the mainland United States. The Musudan theoretically could reach the U.S. Pacific island of Guam. \n \n North Korea is to hold a congress of its ruling Workers Party - the first such meeting in 36 years - in early May, at which Kim Jong Un is likely to trumpet his achievements in building up Pyongyang’s weapons prowess. \n \n South Korean officials and experts say he will be keen to go into that with a show of strength, not a failed rocket launch, making the possibility of another nuclear test more likely. \n \n North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watches the ballistic rocket launch drill of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army (KPA) at an unknown location, in this undated file photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on March 11, 2016.

An American military official says the US also detected and tracked the failed launch, which took place on the most important day in Pyongyang's calendar, the birthday of Kim Il Sung. Officials suspect the missile was a Musudan intermediate-range missile, also known as a BM-25, which Pyongyang has displayed in military parades but never tested before.

And starting on Jan. 13th, Apple will do just that. \n \n The company said Wednesday that China will be among 22 countries that soon will get the newest iPhone, one of Apple's hottest-selling yet. The iPhone now accounts for nearly half of Apple's annual revenue, and some analysts believe it earns the company more than 60% of its profits. \n \n China is one of the world's largest mobile device markets, with close to a billion cellphone users by some estimates. Apple currently partners with China Unicom, one of the larger carriers with close to 200 million cellular subscribers. \n \n Apple said Wednesday it had no current plans to announce a partnership with China Mobile, the country's largest carrier with more than 630 million subscribers (a user base that, somewhat amazingly, is more than twice the size of the U.S. population). But for months now Apple has been rumored to be nailing down a deal with China Mobile, and millions of the carriers' customers are already using the iPhone by modifying the device to work on their network. \n \n Will Siri actually be able to speak and understand Mandarin?

""We believe the demand for the iPhone 4S in Mainland China to be unprecedented,"" White said. \n \n China has increasingly been a major factor in Apple\'s massive revenues. In the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 2011, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong generated 16% of the company\'s total income. \n \n And China, White reminded clients today, is the largest smartphone market in the world. \n \n ""The total mobile phone subscriber base in China was 963.7 million in November, and [the] high-end mobile phone market in China is estimated at 100-125 million subscribers or ~$70 billion,"" said White. \n \n Apple has not revealed prices for the iPhone 4S in China, but most experts believe it will carry the same tag as the iPhone 4 did in 2010: 4,999 yuan ($793) for the 16GB model and 5,999 yuan ($952) for the 32GB model. Those prices are sans a long-term carrier contract. \n \n The 8GB iPhone 4, which sells for $99 in the U.S. with a two-year contract, goes for 3,880 yuan ($633) in China without a contract. \n \n More than 20 other countries -- including Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Senegal -- will also see the iPhone 4S selling on Jan. 13. \n \n Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

108,"['CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - A 1-ton European science satellite plunged back into Earth\'s atmosphere and incinerated with debris most likely landing in the southern regions of the Atlantic Ocean, officials said on Monday. \n \n The last contact by ground tracking stations with Europe\'s Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer, known as GOCE, was at 5:42 p.m. EST (2242 GMT) on Sunday as the spacecraft flew just 75 miles above Antarctica, the European Space Agency said. \n \n Extrapolating from computer models, officials believe GOCE hit the upper atmosphere about 50 miles above the planet\'s surface no later than 7:16 p.m. EST Sunday (0016 GMT Monday) near the Falkland Islands. \n \n ""This would put the main area over which any possible GOCE remnants fell to the southernmost regions of the Atlantic Ocean,"" the space agency wrote in a status report on its website. \n \n ""No damage to property has been reported from any debris,"" the report said. \n \n About 25 percent of the car-sized satellite was expected to have survived re-entry. \n \n GOCE was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth\'s gravity. Scientists assembled the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet\'s crust and mantle, among other projects. \n \n The satellite ran out of fuel on October 21 and had been steadily losing altitude since, tugged by Earth\'s gravity. \n \n The 1.2-ton (1,100-kg) GOCE satellite is small in comparison to other spacecraft that recently crashed back into the atmosphere. \n \n In January 2012, Russia\'s failed 14-ton (12,700-kg) Phobos-Grunt Mars probe returned. In 2011, NASA\'s 6.5-ton (5,900-kg) Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Germany\'s 2.4-ton (2,177-kg) X-ray ROSAT telescope re-entered the atmosphere. \n \n (Editing by Kevin Gray)', 'Image caption Goce needed its engine power to stay in orbit \n \n The European Space Agency\'s (Esa) Goce satellite has re-entered the Earth\'s atmosphere, burning up in the process. \n \n US tracking data suggests any surviving debris fell into the South Atlantic, just off the tip of South America, south of the Falkland Islands. \n \n Dubbed the ""Ferrari of space"" because of its sleek looks, Goce is the first Esa mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry in more than 25 years. \n \n The gravity mapping probe\'s plunge was inevitable once it ran out of fuel. \n \n The mission was operating in an extremely low orbit - at 224km altitude, the lowest of any scientific satellite - and needed to constantly thrust an electric engine to stay aloft, but last month its reserves of xenon fuel were exhausted. \n \n Pre-return modelling had indicated that perhaps a fifth to a quarter of Goce\'s one-tonne mass could have endured the fiery fall through the atmosphere. \n \n Its sophisticated gradiometer - the instrument used to make gravity measurements - incorporated composite materials which were expected to ride out the destructive forces that would ordinarily incinerate traditional components. \n \n Tracking project \n \n The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee - the global forum on ""space junk"" - chose Goce as its special study project for 2013. This meant a large number of tracking and surveillance facilities around the world were activated to monitor the satellite\'s descent to Earth. \n \n A signal from Goce was last acquired at 22:42 GMT on Sunday as it passed 121km (75 miles) above Antarctica. Data from the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) indicated that re-entry occurred a little over one orbit of the Earth later, with the spacecraft starting to break up at 00:16 GMT on Monday at an altitude of about 80km. \n \n This would have put any debris fall in the South Atlantic just east of Tierra Del Fuego. \n \n ""Goce survived for a few minutes longer than we expected - but since re-entries are difficult to predict, this is not very surprising,"" Holger Krag from Esa\'s Space Debris Office told BBC News. \n \n Image caption Goce\'s principal objective was to make maps of the variation in the pull of gravity across the Earth \n \n Goce\'s slender, fin-shaped construction, combined with its magnetic attitude-control system, maintained a stable orientation until very late in the descent. Engineers monitoring the last hours of the satellite from Europe\'s Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, observed Goce to keep a straight-on approach as it dipped deeper and deeper into the atmosphere. \n \n ""This was due to the shape of Goce, which was designed in such a way that it was aerodynamically stabilised,"" said Dr Krag. \n \n Statistics show that there is typically at least one piece of tracked space ""junk"" re-entering the Earth\'s atmosphere every day; with, on average, one intact defunct spacecraft or old rocket body coming back every week. \n \n Esa\'s last mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry was the magnetosphere explorer Isee-2, which came back in 1987. \n \n The agency does, however, regularly manage controlled re-entries. Its space station freighter, the Automated Transfer Vehicle, can weigh some 13 tonnes when it comes back to Earth. \n \n It has fuel and thrusters to direct its destructive dive towards the vast and uninhabited waters of the Southern Ocean, east of New Zealand. \n \n Goce (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) was launched in 2009 as part of a series of innovative environmental research satellites. \n \n Its super-sensitive gradiometer was used to detect the tiny variations in the pull of gravity across the surface of the Earth. \n \n Its maps have very broad applications. The data is a key reference in civil engineering for relating heights measured at widely separated locations, and for the computer models that need to understand how the oceans move to forecast future changes in climate.']",2,"– After four years of mapping our planet's gravity, the European Space Agency's GOCE satellite has plunged back to Earth. The GOCE—Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer—was last heard from 75 miles over Antarctica, Reuters reports. It is believed to have burned up on re-entry, with hundreds of pounds of surviving debris scattering somewhere in the Western Pacific. Its gradiometer, the instrument used to make gravity measurements, is made of materials tough enough to survive the fall to Earth, the BBC notes. GOCE—the planet's lowest-flying scientific satellite—mapped Earth's gravitational field in never-before-seen detail, revealing how gravity's pull is uneven across the world. The satellite's fall to Earth, which was inevitable after it ran out of fuel a few weeks ago, was the ESA's first uncontrolled re-entry in decades. But since GOCE was relatively light at 1.2 tons, it didn't attract the same attention as other recent re-entries, including the crash of a failed Russian probe last year."

The incidents allegedly occurred in 2015. \n \n Hwang claims that when she was brushing dandruff off Savage’s clothing for a shoot, he “violently struck” her on her arm three times. \n \n Hwang also alleges that Savage would often roll his eyes and glare at her, and that he had a reputation for being verbally abusive to female crew members. \n \n In a news conference Wednesday, Hwang alleged that she was “scared of the abuse and what [she’d] have to encounter on any given day” at work, and claimed that her superiors encouraged her not to report Savage’s conduct because they were scared of losing their jobs. \n \n She specifically notes in the suit that an executive producer told her, “I’m not even sure what Fred did constituted harassment and I don’t think you should report it to HR,” per TMZ. \n \n Hwang is seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress. \n \n Savage told Page Six in a statement Wednesday that the claims against him are “absolutely untrue.” \n \n I have witnessed tremendous courage over these past few months, watching brave women who have come forward publicly fighting through the shame and stigma of harassment. I’ve seen first-hand the growing support in this movement that has always felt so lacking. As someone who has always tried to live honorably and with integrity, it never dawned on me that my name could be on the other side. I was made aware that a woman working in the costume department of a show I was on almost three years ago has claimed that I treated her harshly on set simply because she was a woman. These accusations are completely without merit and absolutely untrue. Fox conducted an extensive internal investigation into her claims, a process in which I fully participated. After concluding a thorough investigation, Fox determined that there was absolutely no evidence to support these accusations. None of her claims could be substantiated because they did not happen. I have been working in the entertainment industry my whole life and have always endeavored to treat everyone on any set I work on respectfully and professionally. While none of the accusations being leveled at me are true, I wholeheartedly support all people who feel they are being mistreated come forward and speak to human resources and those in charge. We have witnessed so much bravery from those speaking out recently, but I will just as boldly protect myself and my family from those seeking to tarnish my good name. I cannot let these people in particular denigrate me while harming the message of thousands of women and others who have suffered and continue to suffer. \n \n Fox also defended Savage. \n \n “Fox takes all allegations of improper conduct very seriously. We conducted a thorough investigation into these allegations and found no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Savage, ” a rep for the network told Page Six on Wednesday. “We will vigorously defend against these unfounded claims.” \n \n However, Hwang’s attorney, Anahita Sedaghatfar, alleges that Fox did not conduct an independent investigation into the claims, and says that Savage’s attorneys have refused to speak with her or Hwang. \n \n Sedaghatfar also claims that other women on the set of “The Grinder” filed complaints with Fox about Savage’s behavior, too, though she would not expound on who the other women are or what abuses they had alleged. \n \n “The Grinder” ran from 2015 to 2016. \n \n This isn’t the only complaint about Savage’s on-set behavior. \n \n In January, it was revealed that the actor was sued for sexual harassment in 1993 during his tenure on “The Wonder Years.” \n \n The suit, filed by a costume designer on the show, alleged that then-16-year-old Savage made sexual comments aimed at her and asked to have an affair with her. She claimed she was fired from the show as a result. \n \n The suit, which also went after Savage’s co-star Jason Hervey, was eventually settled for an undisclosed sum. \n \n Savage’s onscreen mother, Alley Mills, claims the show would have continued if it weren’t for the suit, which she dubbed “ridiculous.”']",2,"– A man who went on a murder rampage against white people in San Francisco 40 years ago has died at San Quentin.

110,"['Lean asynchronous computer mediated communication is often considered poor for communicating emotion, yet individuals continue to use it for business, personal, and even romantic communication. We used a lab experiment to investigate the influence of media (email and voicemail) and task type (romantic and utilitarian) on both the psychophysiological responses of senders and the content of the resulting messages. Message senders had more arousing physiological responses when sending emails than when leaving voicemails. An interaction exists between media and task such that the content of romantic email messages was more positive than romantic voicemails; while the opposite was true for utilitarian tasks. Thus the choice of media triggers different emotional responses in the sender and leads to different message content.', 'To email or not to email? For those in love, it\'s better than leaving a voice message \n \n Sept. 1, 2015 \n \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \n \n \n \n BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- In her hit single, Carly Rae Jepsen may have sung, ""Here\'s my number, so call me maybe."" But according to a new research study from Indiana University, she might be more successful in finding love if she asked him to send her an email. \n \n The research, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, suggests that, in this digital age, an email can be more effective in expressing romantic feelings than leaving a voicemail message. \n \n Previous research and conventional wisdom suggested the opposite, that a voicemail message is a more intimate way to connect with others, but that may not be true, particularly among millennials. \n \n “The bottom line is that email is much better when you want to convey some information that you want someone to think about,” said one of the authors, Alan R. Dennis, the John T. Chambers Chair of Internet Systems in IU’s Kelley School of Business. \n \n Dennis and co-author Taylor M. Wells, an assistant professor of management information systems at California State University-Sacramento, set out to learn more about how we respond emotionally to these newer forms of communication. \n \n Although voicemail, email and texting are part of everyday life, very little is known about how their characteristics influence and distort communication in work and personal settings. \n \n Using psychophysiological measures from 72 college-age people, Dennis and Wells found that people who sent romantic emails were more emotionally aroused and used stronger and more thoughtful language than those who left voicemails. \n \n “When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium’s inability to convey vocal tone,” Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper, “To Email or Not to Email: The Impact of Media on Psychophysiological Responses and Emotional Content in Utilitarian and Romantic Communication.” \n \n “Email enables senders to modify the content as messages are composed to ensure they are crafted to the needs of the situation. Voicemail lacks this feature,” they added. “A sender records a voicemail in a single take, and it can be sent or discarded and re-recorded, but not edited. Thus senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal.” \n \n Previous research suggests that email and text chat are considered poor for communicating emotion. This is believed to be the first research study on how we respond to email using physiological measures. \n \n Dennis and Wells’ findings weren’t just about pulling heartstrings -- the use of email induced more arousing psychophysiological responses than voicemail, regardless of whether the message was utilitarian or romantic. Gender was not found to be a factor and was omitted in the final analysis. \n \n In an interview, Dennis noted that their findings run counter to media naturalness theory, a commonly held evolutionary standard suggesting that the further we get away from face-to-face communications, the less natural and less effective it becomes. \n \n “In this case, we found people adapted,” Dennis said. “Email’s been in the popular consciousness since the 1990s, and if you look at the new generation of millenials, and that’s who we studied, they’ve grown up with email and text messaging. So it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought. \n \n “There’s a lot of theory that says email and other text communications don’t really work very well,” Dennis added. “We should probably go back and reconsider a lot of the stereotypical assumptions that we hold about email and text messaging that may not hold true when we take a deeper look at how people react physiologically.” \n \n The researchers did not see much use of emoticons and emojis in their emails. Rather, they found that when writing emails, subjects took more time to choose their words carefully to make sure the language conveyed the full meaning. \n \n The study also demonstrated that the medium used can shape the content of the message. Senders of utilitarian messages sent less positive emails than voicemails for the same communication task. However, when composing romantic messages, senders included the most positive and most arousing emotional content in emails and the least positive and least arousing emotional content in voicemails. \n \n “We expected that using email for romantic communication would be more frustrating than using voicemail, but our data do not show this,” the authors wrote. “There was neither greater emotional arousal nor greater negative emotional valence when using email for romantic tasks versus utilitarian tasks. \n \n “These results taken together suggest that ‘the medium is the message’ (as famously coined by philosopher Marshall McLuhan in 1964) in a more fundamental way than we have previously understood,” they added. “Our results show that the medium changes how message senders feel and what they say.” \n \n Dennis warns managers against misinterpreting these findings to suggest that face-to-face meetings, personal phone calls and other direct forms of communications aren’t as useful. \n \n “If something isn’t really clear and you want to make sure that everyone has the same understanding of what something means, that’s best done in phone calls, face-to-face meetings or video conferencing,” Dennis said. “You have different cues, and it’s also synchronous discussion, as opposed to email, where time goes by before the receiver gets to it.” \n \n The research was conducted by placing skin sensors on the subjects’ faces to measure muscle movement associated with positive and negative emotion, and on their feet to measure arousal. Subjects were randomly chosen to do voicemail or email first and produce a utilitarian or a romantic message first. \n \n Wells conducted the research with Dennis while he was a doctoral candidate at the Kelley School. \n \n Related Links']",2,"– If you want to convey something affectionate or romantic and you can't do it in person, it may be better to send an email than leave a voicemail. So report researchers at Indiana University Bloomington in the journal Computers in Human Behavior after analyzing both the messages being sent and the physical state of those doing the sending. Contrary to previous research and conventional wisdom suggesting that a voicemail message is more intimate than email, this study finds that, at least among the 72 college-age millennials analyzed, the act of writing produced in the sender far more emotional arousal and greater use of emotional language. The effect endures, too, since people tend to respond to messages using the same medium, thus the recipient may in turn experience similarly heightened emotions when replying, reports Pacific Standard. ""When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium's inability to convey vocal tone,"" Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper. ""Senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal."" What's more, the students they studied have, they feel, adapted to the medium. ""If you look at the new generation of millennials, and that's who we studied, they've grown up with email and text messaging,"" one researcher says. ""So it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought."" Or, perhaps, voicemail is just more awkward. (Check out how men and women tend to differ during breakups.)"
111,"['(CNN) -- The search continued Thursday for a gay porn actor suspected of dismembering his acquaintance, posting the video of the incident online and mailing the severed limbs to different locations in Ottawa, including to a political party\'s headquarters, according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. \n \n Authorities are searching for Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, who they allege is responsible for a human torso discovered in Montreal, thought to be linked to a human hand and foot that were separately mailed from Montreal to Ottawa. \n \n Magnotta, also known as Eric Clinton Newman, is a Montreal resident who allegedly knew the victim, identified only as a white male, Montreal police spokesman Ian Lafreniere told reporters Wednesday. \n \n The suspect has no criminal background, and his image and information related to him were later recovered from a ""very graphic"" website, Lafreniere said. \n \n The source later confirmed that at least one of the websites examined by authorities was a pornographic site. \n \n It\'s possible the body parts all came from the same dismembered victim, Lafreniere said, but police are still awaiting the results of forensic testing for confirmation. \n \n ""The two parts of the body that were found in Ottawa ... we\'ve got all the reasons to believe that it\'s linked to our homicide,"" he added, referring to the human torso found in Montreal. \n \n Authorities said they are asking the public for help in locating Magnotta, after a ""coast-to-coast"" warrant was issued for his arrest. Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he\'s apprehended. \n \n Lafreniere said authorities have also found other body parts, potentially from the same attack, which is believed to have been committed in Montreal. It would be the 11th homicide there this year. \n \n ""It wasn\'t a random attack,"" Lafreniere said. ""They knew each other."" \n \n Lafreniere added that Magnotta had been ""involved in some stuff on the Web, that\'s for sure,"" though he would not elaborate. \n \n The human foot was sent to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa, prompting a hazardous materials team to investigate. The officers who responded noticed what appeared to be bloodstains on the box, police said. \n \n Ottawa police Sgt. Steve Hodgson told reporters outside the office that the package had been addressed to the Conservative Party. Staffers had begun to open the package before calling police, he said. \n \n The hand was intercepted by workers at a Montreal postal terminal. \n \n Ottawa\'s major-crimes unit is checking with other police departments for similar cases and looking back through missing-persons files for any clues, according to Constable Marc Soucy, an Ottawa police spokesman. \n \n ""We\'re going to look at every avenue,"" he said. \n \n In Montreal, the human torso was found behind an apartment building, authorities said. \n \n CNN\'s Jake Carpenter, Paula Newton and Matt Smith contributed to this report.', 'Vic Toews, Public Safety Minister, and Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship, have denounced the discovery of a severed hand at an Ottawa mail depot and delivery of foot to Tory headquarters. \n \n Jason Kenney and Vic Toews Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS Vic Toews, Public Safety Minister, and Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship, have denounced the discovery of a severed hand at an Ottawa mail depot and delivery of foot to Tory headquarters. \n \n A police officer removes a package containg a human foot from the Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa on Tuesday. \n \n Body parts found Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS A police officer removes a package containg a human foot from the Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa on Tuesday. \n \n Police have named Magnotta a suspect in the shocking case where dismembered body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including the headquarters of the governing Conservative party. \n \n Luka Magnotta THE CANADIAN PRESS Police have named Magnotta a suspect in the shocking case where dismembered body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including the headquarters of the governing Conservative party. \n \n Police have named Magnotta a suspect in the shocking case where dismembered body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including the headquarters of the governing Conservative party. \n \n Luka Magnotta SUBMITTED IMAGE Police have named Magnotta a suspect in the shocking case where dismembered body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including the headquarters of the governing Conservative party. \n \n Andrew Chung \n \n Quebec Bureau \n \n \n \n WARNING: THIS REPORT CONTAINS GRAPHIC DETAILS \n \n MONTREAL—What began as a case of a severed foot sent to Canada’s ruling party headquarters has spiralled into an astonishing murder case involving a self-professed porn actor with links to Karla Homolka who’s accused of killing and dismembering a man in a Montreal apartment. \n \n Police have launched a Canada-wide manhunt for Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, a Toronto native who appears in several dubious places on the Internet. He’s accused, among other things, of torturing and killing kittens and being romantically linked to notorious sex killer Homolka, though in a 2007 newspaper report he denied this last allegation. \n \n The police hunt follows the discovery Tuesday of a headless torso inside a brown suitcase next to a pile of rubbish at a dingy Montreal apartment building. Police say a foot and hand mailed to Ottawa belonged to the body. \n \n Late Wednesday, CTV News was reporting there was a note in the box containing the severed foot sent to the Conservative headquarters. The note reportedly said it was the first of six body parts, and it indicated the killer would kill again, according to CTV. \n \n In another shocking twist, a grotesque video has emerged on the Internet that appears to show a man stabbing a naked and bound victim dozens of times with an ice pick, defiling the corpse and cutting off the head and limbs. \n \n Montreal police said they are investigating the video, which sources say appears to be authentic. \n \n Though the actual Montreal crime scene appears similar to the one shown in the murder video, police have not confirmed that the video does indeed show the murder of the man whose body parts were mailed to Ottawa. \n \n However, a police source said, “Everything looks like this is the person we’re talking about.” \n \n More: Second body part discovered in Ottawa after severed foot sent to Conservative party headquarters \n \n The sources added there is a “very strong possibility” that the man whose body parts were sent to Ottawa is an Asian male who was reported missing by family members several days ago. \n \n “The suspect and victim knew each other,” Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafrenière confirmed. He didn’t identify the victim. \n \n A source said the victim apparently attended the suspect’s apartment willingly. \n \n “I’ve been doing this job for close to 30 years now and I’ve never seen and never heard of something like this,” Lafrenière said. “It’s like watching a very bad movie. \n \n “It’s important to stay sensitive to these things. Some people might say ‘this happens’ in society. I don’t think so. It’s something very shocking.” \n \n The macabre discovery on Tuesday of a severed foot, delivered to the downtown Ottawa headquarters of the Conservative Party of Canada, set alight confusion and concern on Parliament Hill and made international headlines. \n \n Hours later, Ottawa police confirmed a hand had been found in a package at a Canada Post processing facility. It had apparently been addressed to the Liberal party headquarters. \n \n On Wednesday, the situation escalated as Montreal police said they believed the body parts belonged to the same victim. They asked for the public’s help in finding Magnotta. \n \n The suitcase was reportedly sitting in the rubbish pile since last Friday. The video was posted online on May 25. \n \n Videos from the Toronto Star. \n \n Police spent much of Tuesday combing through the grimy second-floor studio apartment where the torso was found. Its windows look on to a major Montreal expressway. \n \n A poster from the 1942 film Casablanca is visible from outside. The poster can also be seen in photos posted on the Internet appearing to feature Magnotta. \n \n Neighbours had reported a strong foul odour emanating from the studio. Inside, the bed sheets and mattress were soaked with blood. \n \n “There was blood all over the bed,” said building manager Eric Schorer, 59. \n \n There was also a pool of what appeared to be blood on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. Traces were found too in the freezer. \n \n Inside the closet, a message scribbled in red ink reads: “If you don’t like the reflection, don’t look in the mirror. I don’t care.” \n \n Magnotta arrived in Montreal and rented the furnished apartment about four months ago for $490 a month, Schorer said. His rent was paid up to June 1. \n \n “He came from Toronto and wanted to start a job as a caregiver and to be closer to his child,” Schorer recalled. \n \n According to Schorer and other neighbours, Magnotta kept to himself, slept late into the day, going out in the late afternoon, perhaps to work. \n \n Neighbour Derek Mackinnon, 56, said Magnotta spoke to no other neighbours except himself, “maybe because I was gay too.” \n \n “He’s probably one of the coldest people you’ve ever met in your life,” Mackinnon said. \n \n Mackinnon, a former actor who starred in the 1980 horror film Terror Train, said Magnotta asked him how to make the transition from porn into legitimate acting. “He said his porn career was over.” \n \n He said he saw Magnotta bring home a male five nights ago, an unusual sight because he never previously saw the young man with anyone. He saw Magnotta leave the building the next morning wearing a red wig. “I thought, ‘What is going on with that?’ ” \n \n Mackinnon then began to cry, as he revealed that Magnotta had asked him to come to his apartment to see him, also five days ago. \n \n “I wonder,” he whispered, “if that could have been me.” \n \n The suspect legally changed his name in 2006. His birth name is Eric Clinton Newman. Police said he also goes by the pseudonym Vladimir Romanov. \n \n An online profile pegs him as a bisexual porn actor. He has been targeted as a cat torturer and killer by animal rights activists, who have posted horrific videos to support their accusations. In one, a cat is placed in a plastic bag and the air is sucked out with a vacuum. \n \n The suspect’s Facebook page lists a variety of heroes, from Madonna to Joseph Stalin. \n \n “There is such things as Monsters, Demons and Ghosts,” says a quote typed onto that page. “They live inside of us, and sometimes they win.” \n \n He also appears in an online blog posting about necrophilia. And a piece under Magnotta’s name posted in 2009 is titled, “How to Completely Disappear and Never Be Found.” \n \n “When making the decision to disappear, it is very important to understand that this is not a process that can be successfully accomplished overnight,” the article explains. \n \n Two top Conservative ministers denounced the posting of the body parts as a “criminal” act. \n \n “Bizarre and completely horrifying,” said Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, saying it was clearly a “completely disgusting criminal act.” \n \n Conservative Party spokesman Fred DeLorey said the package, when it arrived at headquarters on Tuesday, was brought to Jenni Byrne, a former senior adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the campaign manager in the 2011 election, “because it looked suspicious.” \n \n “It was opened. Ms. Byrne examined it, saw the blood and smelled the odour and made the decision to call police.” \n \n Delorey said that “staff are very upset and disturbed by what happened yesterday.” \n \n With files from Tonda MacCharles and Allan Woods \n \n ALSO FROM THE STAR: \n \n Who is Luka Rocco Magnotta? \n \n Body parts sent to Conservative party headquarters', 'View larger image Luka Rocco Magnotta is shown in a photo from the website www.luka-magnotta.com.

He is believed to be from Toronto and to have repeatedly used aliases and changed his name over the years. \n \n His new name, Luka Rocco Magnotta, has a prolific presence in the darkest corners of the Internet. For nearly two years, it has been notorious among animal-rights activists looking for a man who tortured and killed cats and posted videos of it online. \n \n He is also a low-budget porn actor. \n \n His online presence is much vaster, however, than bisexual porn videos.

His multiple identities were confusing enough that even police had to issue a second press release Wednesday after originally identifying him as ""Rocco Luka."" \n \n The geographic epicentre of their investigation is a grimy apartment building in Montreal\'s west end. \n \n Magnotta was renting Apartment 208 in the brick mid-rise, by the bustling Decarie Expressway. Behind that building, a man\'s torso was found Tuesday in a locked suitcase, buried in a pile of garbage. \n \n On the same day, a foot was found in a package opened at Conservative headquarters and a hand was found at an Ottawa postal warehouse -- the latter package addressed to the Liberal party. \n \n The building manager told The Canadian Press that Magnotta had been living there for about four months. In the manager\'s words, he seemed like a nice guy. \n \n Police in masks were combing through the blood-soaked apartment Wednesday, having zeroed in on that particular unit from which a rotten stench was drifting out, says a building resident. \n \n The neighbour said police were showing neighbours pictures of two men -- the suspected victim and the homicide suspect. \n \n The packages in Ottawa came from a common source. They carried parts from the same male victim, and they were both mailed from Montreal. \n \n Police shared a few new details about the case Wednesday. \n \n ""The suspect and victim knew each other,"" Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere told reporters. ""It isn\'t linked to organized crime."" \n \n It apparently took a few days for anyone to find a body part. A resident in the building described the scene in the trash-filled laneway behind the complex. \n \n ""I saw the suitcase and I was tempted to go get it,"" said Richard Payette, 60. ""It didn\'t look too damaged. I said, \'Maybe I\'ll go down and get it.\' But I changed my mind."" \n \n The grisly discovery was made later, by someone else living nearby. \n \n Police were milling about the second-floor apartment Wednesday, where there were still traces of blood and, reportedly, still some body parts stored. Payette said the door of Apartment 208 was left open for part of the day, and the smell of rotten meat was drifting out into the hallway. \n \n The building manager said Magnotta had lived there for four months but hadn\'t been seen around in a while. He said there were never any complaints about noise in the unit, and that Magnotta passed a credit test to rent there. \n \n ""He seemed like a nice guy,"" said the manager, Eric Schorer. \n \n Police said Magnotta has no criminal record. \n \n What isn\'t clear is why body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including a foot received at the offices of the Conservative party and a hand found at a Canada Post warehouse. \n \n Finding him might not be easy. \n \n ""When making the decision to disappear, it is very important to understand that this is not a process that can be successfully accomplished overnight,"" said the online disappearance tips, penned under Magnotta\'s name. \n \n ""For best results under normal circumstances, a minimum of four months is really necessary to successfully carry out the heroic actions necessary to leave your old life behind. \n \n ""This is certainly not an undertaking to be entered into lightly.""', 'Montreal police say Luka Rocco Magnotta is wanted in a homicide investigation in connection to the delivery of a human foot to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa, and body parts discovered in both cities. \n \n Police said Magnotta, 29, is wanted on a Canada-wide warrant and police are asking for the public\'s help to find him. \n \n Magnotta is also known as Eric Clinton Newman and as Vladimir Romanov.

112,"['Reuters \n \n The American Center for Law and Justice is suing a Maryland community college after a student was denied admittance into a program because he said God is the most important thing in his life. \n \n Brandon Jenkins, a prospective student in the radiation therapy program at the Community College of Baltimore County, exceeded the minimum requirements for entry into the program, but after completing his exam and interview process, he received a notice informing him that he was not selected for the fall 2013 term. \n \n When Jenkins followed up with members of the CCBC staff to find out why he was not being admitted into the program because he wanted to reapply the next term, he was told that among the reasons why he was not selected is because his chosen field is ""not the place for religion."" \n \n During his interview process with a five-person panel, Jenkins was asked: ""What is the most important thing to you?"" And he replied, ""My God."" \n \n But according to ACLJ, a Washington, D.C.â€“based organization that focuses on defending constitutional and human rights laws worldwide, this was the only time Jenkins commented on his belief in God. The ACLJ also noted that he only did so because he was responding to a question asked by one of the CCBC representatives. \n \n A federal lawsuit was filed Monday on Jenkins\' behalf by the ACLJ, which is asking that Jenkins be granted admission into the program, and that he be awarded damages related to the delay in his admission. \n \n After Jenkins requested feedback from the CCBC about his being denied admittance into the program, Adrienne Dougherty, director and coordinator of radiation therapy, told Jenkins: ""I understand that religion is a major part of your life and that was evident in your recommendation letters, however, this field is not the place for religion."" \n \n She continued, ""We have many patients who come to us for treatment from many different religions and some who believe in nothing at all. If you interview in the future, you may want to leave your thoughts and beliefs out of the interview process."" \n \n ACLJ Senior Counsel David French told The Christian Post Wednesday that Dougherty\'s statement to Jenkins is not only ""flatly illegal, but also bigoted."" He also noted that the ""college\'s own lawyer said that he (Jenkins) shouldn\'t wear his faith on his sleeve."" \n \n ""Under what circumstance would answering that God is the most important thing in his life mean that he would be unable to treat people from other religions or from no religion?"" French asked. ""That was an assumption on the college\'s part and had no basis on anything Jenkins said at any point during the interview process."" \n \n French told CP that in all the years he\'s been litigating religious liberty cases, he\'s never seen one like Jenkins,\' where the university specified an applicant\'s religion as being one of the reasons for denying admission. \n \n ""I\'ve been working on cases involving religious liberty on campus for a long time, and I can honestly say, I\'ve never seen it as blatant in the admissions process as you have here,"" he said. \n \n ""The problem is that you have a guy who is qualified in all areas, and in the rejection letter, they single out his faith as a reason for his rejection. That\'s just flatly unlawful,"" French asserted. ""It\'s every bit as unlawful as singling out his race, or singling out his gender. To single out his religion is just as unlawful, and it violates the Constitution."" \n \n French described Jenkins as a ""high-character individual,"" and noted that before he applied to the radiation therapy program, he was helping to run a halfway house, which is work that he continues to do today. \n \n ""He\'s a model citizen,"" he added. ""He\'s exactly the kind of student that community colleges exist to serve. Someone who\'s a productive member of society who wants to broaden their career skills."" \n \n French also emphasized his belief that the question posed to Jenkins â€“ ""What is most important in your life"" â€“ is not an academic question. ""It\'s not related to the radiation therapy program. They asked a question that went far beyond the bounds of the academic program itself, and they got an honest answer, from a Christian, about what\'s most important to him; and then they discriminated against him on that basis. It\'s absurd."" \n \n In the lawsuit that was filed in federal court earlier this week, the ACLJ is asking for an injunction against the university, for Jenkins to be admitted into the program, and for him to be paid damages for the unplanned expenses he incurred because he thought he was going to be a full-time student, but instead had to restart his business after learning his was denied admittance into the physical therapy program. \n \n French told CP that ACLJ sent a letter to the CCBC in an attempt to avoid a lawsuit, but instead, they ""doubled down"" on Jenkins\' Christianity being a disqualifier for admittance into the program. \n \n ""We didn\'t want to sue the college.

113,"[""Italian Space Agency President Roberto Battiston holds a pamphlet reading in Italian 'Colonize Mars, Friday, Oct. 19, 2016, in front of a rendering showing the Schiaparelli Space Module and the planet... (Associated Press) \n \n BERLIN (AP) — Europe's experimental Mars probe hit the right spot — but at the wrong speed — likely ending up in a fiery ball of rocket fuel when it struck the surface at high speed, scientists said Friday. \n \n Pictures taken by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show a black spot in the area where the Schiaparelli lander was meant to touch down Wednesday, the European Space Agency said. The images end two days of speculation following the probe's unexpected radio silence 50 seconds before the planned landing. \n \n Schiaparelli was meant to test technology for a more ambitious European Mars landing in 2020, and scientists say the data it sent back before going silent will prove highly useful for that mission. ESA also stressed that Schiaparelli's mother ship was successfully placed into orbit Wednesday and will begin analyzing the Martian atmosphere in search for evidence of life. \n \n Still, the crash-landing is a painful reminder of how hard it is to put a spacecraft on the surface of the red planet. Europe's Beagle 2 probe reached the surface in 2003 but failed to deploy properly. Only NASA has repeatedly succeeded in landing several robotic vehicles on Mars, including the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers. \n \n ESA said that, according to what its scientists have been able to piece together so far, Schiaparelli suffered problems during the last 50 seconds of its descent through the harsh Martian atmosphere. \n \n Instead of achieving a soft landing it probably plummeted the last 2-4 kilometers (1.4-2.4 miles) onto the surface, therefore impacting at a considerable speed, greater than 300 kilometers (186 miles) per hour. \n \n The pictures taken by NASA suggest that the probe's thrusters — which were meant to slow its final descent — failed, causing it to hit the surface with almost fully loaded tanks of rocket fuel and explode on impact. \n \n While Schiaparelli was able to beam back some 600 megabytes of data before the crash, scientists won't get any of the close-up photos the probe took during its descent. Those were meant to be transmitted after the landing. \n \n ___ \n \n ExoMars mission: http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars"", 'Michael Horn admits carmaker was dishonest with US regulators as France calls for Europe-wide inquiry into emissions-fixing scandal \n \n The US chief executive of Volkswagen has said the company has “totally screwed up” over the emissions scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. \n \n \n \n Michael Horn admitted at an event in Brooklyn, New York, on Monday night that VW had been dishonest with regulators and the public. \n \n VW scandal: what the emissions revelations mean Read more \n \n The world’s second-biggest carmaker could face a fine of up to $18bn (£11.6bn), criminal charges for its executives, and legal action from customers and shareholders due to US claims it used a defeat device to falsify emissions data. The device recognises when the car is being tested and immediately cuts emissions to a level that is much lower than normal and unsustainable under usual driving conditions. \n \n Shares in Volkswagen fell by another 5% on Tuesday after losing almost a fifth of their value on Monday. \n \n \n \n In further developments, France’s finance minister called for a “Europe-wide” investigation into diesel cars to “reassure” the public. \n \n Michel Sapin told French radio: “This is not a minor subject, it’s not about speed or the quality of leather. What we are dealing with is making sure people avoid being poisoned by pollution.” \n \n South Korea said on Tuesday it would investigate emissions of the VW Jetta and Gold models plus Audi A3 cars produced in 2014 and 2015. If problems are found, South Korea’s environment ministry said its inquiry could be expanded to all German diesel imports, which have surged in popularity in recent years in a market long dominated by local producers such as Hyundai. \n \n VW scandal must change how we think about transport and the environment | Letters Read more \n \n The US Congress also confirmed it is investigating the scandal. The House energy and commerce committee chairman, Fred Upton, and the oversight and investigations subcommittee chairman, Tim Murphy, announced that the oversight and investigations subcommittee will hold a hearing. \n \n In addition, the US Department of Justice could conduct a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. \n \n Horn, speaking at an event to launch a new version of the Passat sedan, which featured rock star Lenny Kravitz, said: “Our company was dishonest with the EPA, and the California air resources board and with all of you, and in my German words: we have totally screwed up. \n \n “We must fix the cars to prevent this from ever happening again and we have to make this right. This kind of behaviour is totally inconsistent with our qualities. \n \n “We are committed to do what must be done and to begin to restore your trust. We will pay what we have to pay.” \n \n The comments from Horn are the first in public by a senior VW executive since the scandal emerged, although the company apologised on Sunday. He left the event without taking questions. \n \n One of the officials involved in uncovering the alleged behaviour has told the Guardian that the emissions-fixing scandal could extend to other companies and countries. \n \n Billions of pounds have been wiped off the value of global carmakers amid growing concerns that emissions tests may have been rigged across the industry. \n \n \n \n “We need to ask the question, is this happening in other countries and is this happening at other manufacturers? Some part of our reaction is not even understanding what has happened exactly,” said John German, one of the two co-leads on the US team of the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT), the European-based NGO that raised the alarm. \n \n The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday that VW had installed illegal software to cheat emission tests, allowing its diesel cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. The US government ordered VW to recall 482,000 VW and Audi cars produced since 2009. \n \n \n \n In response, Martin Winterkorn, chief executive of VW, said in a statement on Sunday he was “deeply sorry” for breaking the trust of the public and ordered an external investigation. \n \n A British expert in low-emission vehicles claimed the manipulation of air pollution data could be widespread and that tests in Europe are “much more open to this sort of abuse”. \n \n \n \n Greg Archer, a former government adviser and head of clean vehicles at the respected Transport & Environment thinktank, said: “I am not surprised. There has been a lot of anecdotal evidence about carmakers using these defeat devices. All credit to the EPA for investigating and finding the truth.” \n \n Archer, the former managing director of the UK’s Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership and non-executive director for the government’s Renewable Fuels Agency, said the scandal could spread into petrol cars and CO2 levels. “It is probably not limited to diesel and not limited to emissions,” he added. \n \n The devices are thought to work by injecting more urea – an exhaust fluid – into the car when it is being tested. This limits nitrogen oxide emissions to a fraction of their usual level. The car detects it is being tested because devices such as the anti-collision systems have to be turned off when it is in the laboratory. The extra urea is not injected into the car when it is on the road because it would quickly run out. \n \n Archer claims European tests are more open to abuse because they are conducted before the car goes into mass production and by companies that have been paid by the carmakers. These testing companies have been verified by regulators in each country, such as the Vehicle Certification Agency, but in the US the tests are conducted by an independent body. \n \n \n \n Industry leaders in Britain claimed there was no evidence that manufacturers are cheating the system in Europe but admitted it needs to be reformed. \n \n Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry trade body, said: “The EU operates a fundamentally different system to the US – with all European tests performed in strict conditions as required by EU law and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency. There is no evidence that manufacturers cheat the cycle. \n \n “The industry acknowledges, however, that the current test method is outdated and is seeking agreement from the European commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies and is more representative of on-road conditions.” \n \n The US allegations involve a series of diesel cars produced by VW and the brands it owns, such as Audi. These include the Audi A3, VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models. VW has halted sales of these models.']",2,"– Get ready for a deluge of information in the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case, as prosecutors today released a cache of related documents.

You understand what I mean by that, David. We’re so open, we’re so, “Oh I wouldn’t do this, I wouldn’t do that, I would do this, I would do that.” And it’s not so much with Merkel, but it’s certainly with other countries. You know, that really, where there’s, where there’s a different kind of relationship, and a much worse relationship than with Germany. So, you know there’s so, there’s such predictability with our country. We go and we send 50 soldiers over to the Middle East and President Obama gets up and announces that we’re sending 50 soldiers to the Middle East. Fifty very special soldiers. And they now have a target on their back, and everything we do, we announce, instead of winning, and announcing when it’s all over. There’s such, total predictability of this country, and it’s one of the reasons we do so poorly. You know, I’d rather not say that. I would like to see what they’re doing. Because you know, many countries, I can’t say Germany, but many countries are spying on us. I think that was a great disservice done by Edward Snowden. That I can tell you. \n \n How to Defeat ISIS \n \n HABERMAN: Mr. Trump, you have talked about your plans to defeat ISIS, and how you would approach it. Would you be willing to stop buying oil from the Saudis if they’re unwilling to go in and help? \n \n SANGER: On the ground? \n \n TRUMP: Oh yeah, sure. I would do that. The beautiful thing about oil is that, you know, we’re really getting close, because of fracking, and because of new technology, we’re really in a position that we weren’t in, you know, years ago, and the reason we’re in the Middle East is for oil. And all of a sudden we’re finding out that there’s less reason to be. Now, now, we’re in the Middle East for really defense, because we can’t allow them, I mean, look, I was against the war in Iraq. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it has destabilized it, it’s totally destabilized the Middle East. The way Obama got out of the war was, you know, disgraceful, and idiotic. When he announced the date certain, they pulled back, and they said, “Oh, well.” As much as they don’t mind dying, they do mind dying. And they pulled back, and then, you know, it’s a, it was a terrible thing the way he announced that, and then he didn’t leave troops behind so that, you know, whatever there was of Iraq, which in my opinion wasn’t very much, because I think that, you know, the government was totally corrupt, and they put the wrong people in charge, and you know, that in its own way led to the formation of ISIS, because they weren’t given their due. But, I think that President Obama, the way he got out of that war was unbelievable. I think Hillary Clinton was catastrophic in those decisions, having to do with Libya and just about everything else. Every bad decision that you could make in the Middle East was made. And now if you look at it, if you would go back 15 years ago, and I’m not saying it was only Obama, It was Obama’s getting out, it was other people’s getting in, but you go back 15 years ago, and I say this, if our presidents would have just gone to the beach and enjoyed the ocean and the sun, we would’ve been much better off in the Middle East, than all of this tremendous death, destruction, and you know, monetary loss, it’s just incredible. ’Cause we’re further, we’re far worse off today than we were 15 years ago or 10 years ago in the Middle East. Far worse. \n \n SANGER: But I just want to make sure I understand your answer to Maggie’s question. So you said earlier this week that we should use air power but not send in ground forces. That had to be done by the regional Arab partners. We assume by that, you mean the Saudis, the U.A.E. and others from whom we might purchase oil or have alliances. I think Maggie’s question, if I understood it right, was if these countries are unwilling to send in ground troops against ISIS, and so far they have been, despite President Obama’s efforts to get them in, would you be willing to say, “We will stop buying oil from you, until you send ground troops?” \n \n TRUMP: There’s two answers to that. The answer is, probably yes, but I would also say this: We are not being reimbursed for our protection of many of the countries that you’ll be talking about, that, including Saudi Arabia. You know, Saudi Arabia, for a period of time, now the oil has gone down, but still the numbers are phenomenal, and the amount of money they have is phenomenal. But we protect countries, and take tremendous monetary hits on protecting countries. That would include Saudi Arabia, but it would include many other countries, as you know. We have, there’s a whole big list of them. We lose, everywhere. We lose monetarily, everywhere. And yet, without us, Saudi Arabia wouldn’t exist for very long. It would be, you know, a catastrophic failure without our protection. And I’m trying to figure out, why is it that we aren’t going in and saying, at a minimum, at a minimum it’s a two-part question, with respect to Maggie’s question. But why aren’t we going in and saying, “At a minimum, I’m sorry folks, but you have to, under no circumstances can we continue to do this.” You know, we needed, we needed oil desperately years ago. Today, because – again, because of the new technologies, and because of places that we never thought had oil, and they do have oil, and there’s a glut on the market, there’s a tremendous glut on the market, I mean you have ships out at sea that are loaded up and they don’t even know where to go dump it. But we don’t have that same pressure anymore, at all. And we shouldn’t have that for a long period of time, because there’s so many places. I mean, they’re closing wells all over the place. So, I would say this, I would say at a minimum, we have to be reimbursed, substantially reimbursed, I mean, to a point that’s far greater than what we’re being paid right now. Because we’re not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that we’re performing by protecting various countries. Now Saudi Arabia’s one of them. I think if Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection of our country’s, of U.S. protection, think of Saudi Arabia. I don’t think it would be around. It would be, whether it was internal or external, it wouldn’t be around for very long. And they’re a money machine, they’re a monetary machine, and yet they don’t reimburse us the way we should be reimbursed. So that’s a real problem. And frankly, I think it’s a real, in terms of bringing our country back, because our country’s a poor country. Our country is a debtor nation, we’re a debtor nation. I mean, we owe trillions of dollars to people that are buying our bonds, in the form of other countries. You look at China, where we owe them $1.7 trillion, you have Japan, $1.5 trillion. We’re a debtor nation. We can’t be a debtor nation. I don’t want to be a debtor nation. I want it to be the other way. One of the reasons we’re a debtor nation, we spend so much on the military, but the military isn’t for us. The military is to be policeman for other countries. And to watch over other countries. And there comes a point that, and many of these countries are tremendously rich countries. Not powerful countries, but – in some cases they are powerful – but rich countries. \n \n SANGER: One more along the lines of your ISIS strategy. You’ve seen the current strategy, which is, you’ve seen Secretary Kerry trying to seek a political accord between President Assad and the rebel forces, with Assad eventually leaving. And then the hope is to turn all those forces, including Russia and Iran, against ISIS. Is that the right way to do it? Do you have an alternative approach? \n \n TRUMP: Well, I thought the approach of fighting Assad and ISIS simultaneously was madness, and idiocy. They’re fighting each other and yet we’re fighting both of them. You know, we were fighting both of them. I think that our far bigger problem than Assad is ISIS, I’ve always felt that. Assad is, you know I’m not saying Assad is a good man, ’cause he’s not, but our far greater problem is not Assad, it’s ISIS.', 'Conservative provocateur James O\'Keefe hasn\'t done much worth crowing about since he took down ACORN with misleadingly edited secret videotapes. He was feted as a right-wing celebrity. He got arrested for trying to sneak into a senator\'s office under false pretenses. And then he had his attempted prank of a CNN reporter backfire when the reporter backed out after discovering that he planned to lure her onto a boat and ""seduce"" her. O\'Keefe has responded , finally, to this last embarrassment. Unsurprisingly, he has no regrets, and the liberal media is the real guilty party. \n \n O\'Keefe\'s defense -- posted, of course, on Andrew Breitbart\'s ""Big Government"" -- rests on us believing that the prank-outlining document obtained by CNN was a draft that O\'Keefe did not plan on actually following. He says ideas for stunts are sent to him all the time (like a fancy Hollywood producer!) and sometimes he approves of the idea behind a prank without endorsing everything about it. \n \n As you can imagine in our line of work, we get lots of leads, ideas, schemes and “punked” style plans sent to us all the time. If you were to roam through my personal emails there are many outrageous plans, some parts of which I may approve of in principal with an “I like it” in an email thread. But I may well object to a host of things about the plan, though I like the objective. When the CNN idea was pitched to me, I’ll admit that I liked the basic absurdity of meeting Abbie Boudreau on a boat and the idea of counter-seduction satire executed in a tame, humorous, non-threatening manner. After all, as all liberal reporters do, she was trying to “seduce” (a metaphor) me so she could get more for her story. It would be fun, I thought, to turn the tables in jest. However, I was repulsed by the over-the-top language and symbolism that was suggested in the memo that was sent to me, and never considered that for a moment. \n \n The gross document in question wasn\'t submitted by a fan. It was drafted by Ben Wetmore, with whom O\'Keefe has worked for years. O\'Keefe has called Wetmore his mentor. O\'Keefe and his attempted phone-tampering buddies crashed at Wetmore\'s Louisiana house the month of the Landrieu office incident. \n \n The rest of O\'Keefe\'s defense lies in still not understanding why unwanted ""seduction,"" on a boat, under false pretenses, while being secretly filmed, might not just be considered harmless fun. \n \n In my version, the reporter was never going to be placed in a threatening situation. She would have had to consent before being filmed and she was not going to be faux “seduced” unless she wanted to be. If a CNN reporter would be willing to engage in such a folly, it might even be more newsworthy than Rick Sanchez’s firing. (CNN also has Elliot Spitzer on payroll. He’s done more outrageous things than anything I’ve ever gotten in my in-box). The sexually explicit document CNN is now “reporting” on was never going to be implemented as written. She saw how I was dressed that day, with my usual blazer and collared shirt. In the document she reported as being “authentic,” I was supposed to have been dressed with my chest exposed, slicked backed hair, with gold chains. That ought to have been a red flag the document was not a reflection of my true intentions. Ms. Boudreau was never going to be put in the bizarre situations outlined in the document CNN reported. There were no mirrors, sex tapes, blindfolds, fuzzy handcuffs, posters of naked women, or music. Sorry, you were not going to see my face saying the words “Bubble Headed Beach Blonde who comes on at 5” into a video camera. Those are Don Henley lyrics – and we know, thanks to Chuck DeVore, how much Henley loathes parody. \n \n Not seduced unless she wanted to be! I mean, his ""prank"" as described here makes even less sense as a ""political"" act than the plan Wetmore wrote. He was going to lure her onto a regular boat with nothing outrageous or unusual about it, dressed conservatively, get her consent to film her, and then only ""pretend"" to ""seduce"" her if he somehow determined that she would be into that? \n \n O\'Keefe accomplice Izzy Santa seemed to think -- on the day of the planned punking -- that O\'Keefe\'s boat was full of strawberries and champagne, and that the plan was to creep Boudreau out. There\'s no point to getting her on the boat and filming her if you\'re not going to be gross. Even if O\'Keefe found elements of Wetmore\'s idiotic script objectionable, the idea behind it remains the same. \n \n (As for O\'Keefe\'s dress: Even if he was in his usual uniform of blazer and collared shirt that day, history suggests that footage of O\'Keefe in the ""funnier"" get-up -- perhaps surrounded by ""funnier"" decor on the ""sex boat"" -- would have ended up in the completed video.) \n \n The rest of O\'Keefe\'s post can be summarized thusly: ACORN liberal bias Planned Parenthood ACORN Charlie Rangel ACORN.', 'Rep. Aaron Schock: \'Hottest freshman\' in Congress pushes beyond his media-friendly profile \n \n Already busy in committees, Schock \'has already established himself as a leader,\' House GOP whip says \n \n Aaron Schock hasn\'t wanted for attention since being elected to the House of Representatives last fall as a 27-year-old from Illinois. He has bounced from Stephen Colbert\'s show to CNN, while his own videos go viral on YouTube. \n \n WASHINGTON — He is the Republican ""Dream Date,"" a smooth-speaking, polished product of Peoria, as comfortable with Facebook as a face-to-face. John McCain\'s daughter gushed over him as the future of the party. Readers of the liberal Webzine Huffington Post voted him the hottest freshman in Congress. TMZ trails him like a pop star. \n \n Much of the interest stems from his unlined face and full head of brown hair. (He recently brushed aside a request from host Howard Kurtz on CNN that he take off his jacket and show more of his physique.) \n \n Schock offers an alternative to the GOP tent poles, such as McCain, House Republican leader John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. \n \n Other GOP fresh faces include Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia. But Schock can top them all in one respect: He\'s Capitol Hill\'s first Reagan Baby, born while the Republican lodestar was in his first term. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), the House\'s longest-serving member, had been in Congress for 26 years when Schock was born. At 82, he\'s 55 years Schock\'s senior. \n \n Congress is one place where the simple quality of being young is newsworthy. The average age of a member of Congress this session is 57. But away from the Beltway, the young dominate the culture. The NBA\'s LeBron James is 24. Golfer Tiger Woods is 33. Arguably the hottest author in America, Stephanie Meyer of the ""Twilight"" series, is 35. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is 24. Millionaires, all. \n \n But in his world, Schock remains an outlier. And he is prepared to take full advantage of that. Other politicos might be mortified -- or feel trivialized -- if they are ambushed by TMZ\'s cameras or win a ""most attractive"" poll. But for the media-centric Schock, it\'s all about keeping the channel open. \n \n ""First, you\'ve got to get their attention,"" Schock said last week outside the House chamber before he entered for a vote on the budget. ""Step one in getting anyone\'s vote is getting their attention."" \n \n That may be part of the long-term plan. Schock\'s Internet reputation belies his serious, even wonky approach to his new job. On Thursday, he hosted a conference call for reporters to discuss his plan for a payroll tax holiday for small businesses.

115,"['Trump picks Perry to lead Energy Department he once vowed to kill Conservatives view Perry as someone with management experience who would be willing to question the agency’s status quo. \n \n On a presidential debate stage five years ago, Rick Perry blanked on the Energy Department\'s name when trying to include it in a list of agencies he promised to abolish — memorably concluding with ""oops."" \n \n Now Donald Trump has chosen the former Texas governor to lead the sprawling department, which oversees the security of the nation\'s nuclear weapons and has played major roles in President Barack Obama\'s climate agenda and nuclear deal with Iran. Three sources close to the transition confirmed the choice Tuesday. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Conservatives had favored the former Texas governor for the job, viewing him as someone with management experience who would be willing to question the agency’s status quo. They believe Perry might bring serious reform to the agency because he isn\'t wedded to energy programs, such as DOE\'s fossil and efficiency offices, that conservatives have criticized as unnecessary, market-distorting schemes. \n \n Trump\'s choice of his fellow climate skeptic and former 2016 presidential primary rival comes just a year and a half after Perry described the brash New Yorker as a “cancer on conservatism.” It also arrives at a time of heightened political pressure for DOE, which has a $29.6 billion budget and more than 100,000 federal employees and contractors sprawled around the country. \n \n The conservative Heritage Foundation last month urged the next president to eliminate vast swaths of the department, including all the research, development, regulatory and loan programs that the Obama administration has used to drive advances in green energy, as well as its 700-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And last week, Trump\'s transition team asked DOE to supply the names of all agency employees who had worked on Obama\'s climate initiatives, a request that Democrats and former staffers denounced as a ""witch hunt."" \n \n A Trump spokesman, when asked Tuesday whether the incoming president planned to dismantle the agency in its current form, declined to rule it out. \n \n ""We haven\'t made any comments or plans as far as specific agencies. The one thing we\'ve seen from the president-elect so far is he won\'t be shy calling out -- whether it\'s taxpayer fraud or abuse or certain deals put together that aren\'t doing right by the taxpayers,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. \n \n Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history, also had the Energy Department in his sights during the 2012 presidential campaign, when he called for eliminating it as part of his program to shrink the federal government. \n \n That was the origin of Perry’s “oops” moment in November 2011, when he said during a Republican debate that “it’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone: Commerce, Education and the, uh, uh, what’s the third one there, let’s see?” Pressed on whether he could name the third agency, he confessed: “I can’t. Sorry.” \n \n Perry later said the third agency would have been the Energy Department. \n \n That memory hiccup seemed to be the least of his worries in appealing to Trump, whom he had scorched during his short-lived second bid for the GOP presidential nomination last year. Besides likening Trump to cancer in July 2015, Perry called the New Yorker\'s campaign “a toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued” — a rhetorical assault arguably harsher than the later salt-the-earth attacks that Mitt Romney launched on the GOP nominee. \n \n By May, however, Perry endorsed Trump saying, ""He wasn\'t my first choice, wasn\'t my second choice, but he is the people\'s choice."" \n \n Perry, a former Air Force captain, made at least two visits to Trump Tower in recent weeks, which kicked off speculation that he was angling for a national security-related post, such as secretary of Defense. He also met with Trump at the Army-Navy football game in Baltimore on Saturday and visited the Tower on Monday. \n \n He also went to bat for Trump when the real estate mogul drew criticism for going after Khizr Khan, the father of a fallen U.S. soldier, who had delivered a scathing rebuke at the Democratic National Convention this summer. The elder Khan then continued to assail the Republican nominee on television. \n \n “Mr. Khan is the one that went out and struck the first blow,” said Perry in August. “And in a campaign, if you\'re going to go out and think you can take a shot at someone and not have incoming coming back at you, shame on you.” \n \n Perry was once a Democrat and even served as Al Gore\'s state chairman during the 1988 presidential campaign — a fact Perry found himself defending during his first White House run. “This was Al Gore before he invented the internet and got to be Mr. Global Warming,” Perry told an Iowa radio station in August 2011. (Gore’s later rejoinder: ""I don\'t know what has happened to him since then."") \n \n After leaving the governor\'s office in 2015, Perry landed a job as chief strategy officer at MCNA Dental, a dental insurance company that had been a major donor to his presidential campaign. Early this year he ran afoul of a Florida ethics law by failing to register as a lobbyist before meeting with Gov. Rick Scott to discuss MCNA\'s role in the state’s Medicaid program, as POLITICO reported at the time. \n \n Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Perry\'s expected nomination ""defies all logic,"" citing the former governor\'s previous interest in dismantling the agency. \n \n The New Jersey lawmaker, who won\'t get to vote on Perry\'s nomination, also zinged the incoming DOE chief for his reality show adventure earlier this year: ""It is also deeply unsettling that our current Secretary of Energy, a renowned nuclear physicist, could be succeeded by a contestant on Dancing with the Stars. Governor Perry is simply not qualified for this position and should be rejected.” \n \n ""Dancing with the Stars"" began trending on Twitter Tuesday morning. \n \n By taking charge of the Energy Department, Perry would be leading an agency often slighted by presidents — for many presidents-elect, including Trump, it\'s among the last Cabinet posts to be filled — despite its significant national security footprint. While the agency writes efficiency regulations, runs energy research programs and funds basic science, it’s also the overlooked guardian and caretaker of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile. \n \n DOE and its network of national labs also played an integral part in the Obama administration’s formulation and defense of last year’s Iran nuclear deal. It has also issued billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees for green-energy projects backed by companies like Tesla and Google, helping foster a boom in projects such as large wind farms and utility-scale solar power installations — although Republicans have preferred to focus on its $535 million loan guarantee to the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra. The much-maligned program, overall, is now a net profit for the federal government, although many conservatives believe such projects should be left to the private sector on principle. \n \n Nuclear weapons maintenance and Cold War nuclear waste cleanup projects consume about two-thirds of DOE’s budget every year, and Perry is likely to be paired with a deputy energy secretary with a greater expertise in those areas. In addition, lawmakers are expected to restart the long-stalled nuclear waste project underneath Yucca Mountain, Nev. — long bottled up by opposition from retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid — putting the issue back on DOE’s agenda. \n \n During Perry’s White House campaigns he repeatedly called for “energy independence,” along with a rollback of regulations coming out the Interior Department and the EPA. \n \n The oil business is a home state industry for Perry, and he\'s on the board of directors for Energy Transfer Partners, the developers of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, which would ship as much as 570,000 barrels a day of oil from the shale fields of North Dakota across four states. That $3.7 billion project — the target of months of heated protests — experienced a setback earlier this month when the Army Corp of Engineers announced that it would study alternative routes for the pipeline. \n \n According to disclosures with the SEC, Perry received nearly $237,000 in cash and shares from the company last year. While DOE doesn\'t have a direct responsibility for pipeline projects, Perry likely will have to step down from the board and sell any stock he might have in the company should be get confirmed. \n \n Almost anyone Trump selected for DOE was expected to shift away from the Obama administration’s emphasis on addressing climate change, and Perry fits the bill. Where Trump has called climate change a “hoax,” Perry has gone even further by alleging a profit motive, asserting that “a substantial number of scientists ... have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects.” \n \n While the levers of energy regulation are limited at DOE when compared to agencies like EPA, Perry could slow-walk the department’s appliance efficiency mandates and de-emphasize its research on climate science. Those efficiency regulations account for half of the greenhouse gas reduction targets that Obama made part of his Climate Action Plan in 2013. And there\'s no undoing them in one fell swoop: Dozens of rulemakings are involved and would require a massive, years-long effort to go after them one by one. \n \n Renewable energy research at DOE may also take a hit under Perry, even though he presided over a massive boom in Texas’ wind power production fueled by federal incentives — enough that the state’s been looking to sell its excess power across the border into Mexico. \n \n The Heritage Foundation has urged the incoming Trump administration to go even further, saying the next secretary should take an ax to much of the department to “end the destructive role played by the federal government in the energy sector.” \n \n Although many in Congress, including Republicans, would resist overhauling too much of the agency, a Heritage “blueprint” released last month said DOE should eliminate all spending on research, development and commercialization of energy technologies, and put the private sector in charge of managing nuclear waste. It went on to call for getting rid of its programs on green energy, efficiency and energy reliability, and revoking Obama’s mandates that federal agencies get more of their electricity from renewable sources. \n \n The conservative group also said the department should draw down and sell all the oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the stockpile that the government has held for decades to guard against foreign-driven shocks to the global oil markets. “Eliminating the government-controlled stockpile will reveal that private inventories and reserves are sufficient to meet U.S. needs, and private markets will respond more efficiently to supply shocks,” the group said.', 'Image copyright AP Image caption Rick Perry at Trump Tower \n \n Donald Trump has picked ex-Texas Governor Rick Perry as his energy secretary, a department whose name he famously forgot in a TV debate. \n \n The nomination puts Mr Perry in charge of an agency he proposed abolishing in a failed 2012 White House bid. \n \n Environmental groups called the oil-drilling advocate\'s selection ""an insult to our functioning democracy"". \n \n In the role, the recent Dancing with the Stars contestant would oversee America\'s nuclear arsenal. \n \n Trump appoints another military veteran \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \'Oops\': Rick Perry\'s debate disaster \n \n Mr Trump said in a statement: ""As the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy."" \n \n If confirmed by the Senate, green activists fear Mr Perry will shift the department away from renewable energy and towards fossil fuels. \n \n During 14 years as governor, he called for lighter regulation of the oil industry, and referred to the science around climate change as ""unsettled"". \n \n Mr Perry is on the board of directors at Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. \n \n Accepting the nomination, Mr Perry said: ""I look forward to engaging in a conversation about the development, stewardship and regulation of our energy resources, safeguarding our nuclear arsenal, and promoting an American energy policy that creates jobs and puts America first."" \n \n Image copyright ABC Image caption Mr Perry was the second contestant eliminated on this season\'s Dancing with the Stars \n \n He was briefly frontrunner in a previous Republican White House race until a disastrous brain freeze on live television. \n \n During the November 2011 forum, Mr Perry vowed to ditch three cabinet-level departments if elected. \n \n After mentioning the departments of Commerce and Education, he said: ""I can\'t.

Here's what you need to know about him. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Julio Negron,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) \n \n President-elect Donald Trump picked Rick Perry to head the Energy Department on Wednesday, seeking to put the former Texas governor in control of an agency whose name he forgot during a presidential debate even as he vowed to abolish it. \n \n Perry, who ran for president in the past two election cycles, is likely to shift the department away from renewable energy and toward fossil fuels, whose production he championed while serving as governor for 14 years. \n \n His nomination — announced officially by Trump’s transition team a day after sources leaked the decision — stirred further alarm from environmental groups and others worried that the Trump administration will roll back efforts to expand renewable energy and give a powerful platform for officials questioning the scientific consensus on climate change. \n \n The Energy Department was central to the 2011 gaffe that helped end his first presidential bid. Declaring that he wanted to eliminate three federal agencies during a primary debate in Michigan, Perry then froze after mentioning the Commerce and Education departments. “The third one, I can’t. Sorry. Oops.” \n \n [Trump taps Montana congressman Ryan Zinke, who frequently votes against environmentalists, as Interior secretary] \n \n Later during the debate, Perry offered: “By the way, that was the Department of Energy I was reaching for a while ago.” \n \n Speaking to reporters once the event was over, he said, “The bottom line is I may have forgotten energy, but I haven’t forgotten my conservative principles, and that’s what this campaign is really going to be about.” \n \n Despite its name, most of the Energy Department’s budget is devoted to maintaining the nation’s stockpile of nuclear warheads and to cleaning up nuclear waste at sites left by military weapons programs. The department runs the nation’s national laboratories, sets appliance standards and hands out grants and loan guarantees for basic research, solar cells, capturing carbon dioxide from coal combustion and more. \n \n Four years after his first Oval Office bid, the former governor sought it once again in the big Republican field that included Trump. Perry touted the high rate of job growth and the low tax rate his state enjoyed under his leadership. At one point, he dismissed Trump’s campaign as a “barking carnival act.” \n \n [What Rick Perry’s wink says about his own art of the deal] \n \n The child of a cotton farmer and county commissioner from west Texas, Perry immersed himself in politics from a young age. He was elected as a Democrat to the state legislature but switched to the GOP when he ran for Texas agriculture commissioner. \n \n As governor, he recruited out-of-state firms to Texas. In 2013, he starred in an ad that aired in California in which he declared that companies should visit his home state “and see why our low taxes, sensible regulations and fair legal system are just the thing to get your business moving. To Texas.” \n \n Salo Zelermyer, who served as a senior counsel at the Energy Department’s general counsel’s office under President George W. Bush and is now a partner at the Bracewell law firm, said Perry has proven “it is indeed possible to successfully balance appropriate environmental regulations with domestic energy production and use.” \n \n “During his time in office, Perry embodied the type of ‘all of the above’ approach to U.S. energy production that many have advocated on both sides of the aisle,” Zelermyer said. “Rick Perry’s Texas was not only a world leader in oil and gas production; it was also a global leader in wind power and renewable energy investment. This approach is a big reason Texas experienced such enormous job growth during Perry’s tenure.” \n \n [Trump says ‘nobody really knows’ if climate change is real] \n \n But environmentalists take a dim view of Perry. The former governor has repeatedly questioned scientific findings that human activity is helping drive climate change. In 2011 during a presidential debate, he compared the minority of scientists who challenged this assumption to 17th-century astronomer Galileo, who was persecuted by the Catholic Church after suggesting that the Earth revolved around the Sun, rather than the reverse. \n \n “The science is not settled on this. The idea that we would put Americans’ economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that’s not settled yet to me is just nonsense,” Perry said at the time. “Just because you have a group of scientists who stood up and said here is the fact. Galileo got outvoted for a spell.” \n \n In his 2010 book, “Fed Up!” Perry described the science showing that climate change was underway and caused by humans as a “contrived phony mess,” writing that those who embraced this idea “know that we have been experiencing a cooling trend, that the complexities of the global atmosphere have often eluded the most sophisticated scientists, and that draconian policies with dire economic effects based on so-called science may not stand the test of time.” \n \n [Yes, Trump met with Al Gore. But his transition tells a very different climate story] \n \n “Al Gore is a prophet all right, a false prophet of a secular carbon cult, and now even moderate Democrats aren’t buying it,” he added, referring to the former vice president and environmentalist. Gore met with Trump recently to discuss climate change. \n \n Later, during the 2012 presidential campaign, Perry said, “There are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects.” \n \n In fact, the top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal record-keeping began in 1880. The 2014 summary report for policymakers by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was endorsed by officials from nearly 200 countries, stated, “Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic [human caused] emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history.” \n \n [Trump has picked the most conservative EPA leader since 1981. This one will face much less resistance.] \n \n “There is no doubt that Rick Perry is completely unfit to run an agency he sought to eliminate — and couldn’t even name. Perry is a climate change denier, opposes renewable energy even as it has boomed in Texas, and doesn’t even believe CO2 is a pollutant,” League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski said in a statement. “Not only that, he is deep in the pocket of Big Polluters, who have contributed over $2.5 million to his presidential campaigns, a disturbing sign that they expected him to protect their profits in office, not do what’s best for the American people.” \n \n Bill Richardson, who was energy secretary under President Clinton, said that Perry was a deal maker, political presence and good manager, and therefore a “sensible choice.” But he said that “my big concern is that he’s too tied to the fossil fuel industry and because of Donald Trump’s positions he will try to dismantle the very valuable renewable energy and climate change programs and policies that are a huge part of the DOE.” \n \n Wind power did expand under Perry during his tenure in Texas — from 200 megawatts in 2000 to 14,098 megawatts in 2014, according to the American Wind Energy Association — and he supported the construction of transmission lines nearly a decade ago that helped bring wind-generated electricity to market. \n \n “He created an environment conducive to economic investment through robust infrastructure and competitive power markets that allowed new technologies to enter,” said Tom Kiernan, the chief executive of the American Wind Energy Association, in a statement. “The Texas model under Gov. Perry’s leadership enabled the growth of low-cost wind energy that made the grid more diverse and reliable while saving consumers money.” \n \n [Energy Dept. rejects Trump’s request to name climate change workers, who remain worried] \n \n “The fact that Gov. Perry refuses to accept the broad scientific consensus on climate change calls into question his fitness to head up a science-based agency like DOE,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. But, he added, as governor Perry “increased the ambition of the state’s Renewable Energy Standard, directed state funds to innovative wind energy R&D initiatives, and created a ‘Competitive Renewable Energy Zone’ that helped expand transmission of renewables, bringing clean wind energy from rural communities to new state markets.” \n \n However during a 2015 Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines, the former governor said he opposed extending the federal tax credit for wind power. “I do if a state wants to do it,” he said. “I don’t at the federal level. I think all of these need to be looked at, whether it’s oil and gas, whether it’s the wind side, whether it’s the [Renewable Fuel Standard program] — I think all of them need to be put on the table, prove whether or not these are in fact in the best interest of this country.” \n \n Referring to renewable sources, Jennifer Layke, the World Resources Institute energy program director, said: “The Department of Energy leads essential programs that drive innovation and fill important gaps to get new technologies off the ground. These are vital to keep the U.S. at the frontier of energy technology. In recent years, the Department of Energy has given U.S. businesses a significant boost to accelerate the development of battery storage, solar panels and electric vehicles. These programs must continue.” \n \n Perry sits on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, the firm that is trying to complete work on the Dakota Access Pipeline on the Great Plains. Under President Obama, the Army Corps of Engineers recently decided to withhold a key permit from the company that is needed to finish the oil pipeline. The pipeline has drawn protests from activists who say that segment of the pipeline would disturb American Indian burial grounds and pollute the drinking water of the nearby Indian reservation. The Energy Department has not played a role in that decision-making process, however, and Trump has indicated he would allow the project to move forward once he takes office. \n \n [DOE leaders refuse to identify specific climate change employees for Trump transition team] \n \n The Energy Department Perry would take over has changed substantially since its creation in 1977 under President Carter on the heels of the oil crisis that struck after the Arab countries of OPEC imposed an embargo on the United States. In the 1970s, the agency focused on weapons maintenance and regulations. In the 1980s, nuclear weapons research took center stage. In the 1990s, arms control and anti-proliferation took priority. \n \n But the last two secretaries, physicists Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz, have moved laboratories and other energy programs toward finding ways to slow climate change. The much derided loan and loan guarantee program — which stumbled with a half billion loss linked to solar panel maker Solyndra — has as of September had issued $31.98 billion in loans and loan guarantees for 30 projects, which have leveraged $50 billion in total project investment and created or saved 56,000 jobs. More than $1.65 billion in interest payments have already been paid. \n \n Moniz also used his knowledge of physics and nuclear weapons, and the department’s national laboratories to play a key role in talks aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear program. Perry brings lacks that knowledge. \n \n If confirmed, Perry would walk into an agency where many career civil servants are likely to be wary of him, not only because of his past pledge to abolish the department. Employees there are already on edge, given the fact that Trump’s transition team gave a questionnaire to DOE officials asking that they identify which employees have worked on either international climate negotiations or domestic initiatives to cut carbon. \n \n Current DOE leaders have declined to provide any individual names of employees to Trump transition team members. \n \n Speaking to reporters Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration needed to resist “what certainly could have been an attempt to target civil servants, career federal government employees … who are critical to success of the federal government’s ability to make policy, and their work transcends the term of any one president. That’s by design.” \n \n “Our principle — this is principle that presidents of both parties have long abided by — is that we should observe the protections that are in place, that ensure that career civil servants are evaluated based on merit, and not on politics,” Earnest added, before tweaking Trump for his latest Cabinet pick. “And I’m sure the president-elect used the same kind of criteria when choosing his new Department of Energy Secretary as well.

116,"['NEW YORK (AP) — Rescue crews are searching Indonesian waters for AirAsia Indonesia Flight 8501, which disappeared Sunday with 162 passengers and crew onboard. The plane was flying from Surabaya, Indonesia\'s second-largest city, and was about halfway to its destination, Singapore, when it vanished from radar. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED? \n \n A: It is way too early to know for sure, but here are some options. The plane was in the safest part of flight: Just 10 percent of fatal crashes from 2004 through 2013 occurred while a plane was at cruise elevation, according to a safety study published by Boeing in August. \n \n Passing through bad weather such as severe thunderstorms could have been a factor. Airbus jets have sophisticated computers that automatically adjust to wind shears or other weather disruptions. But weather — combined with pilot errors — has played a role in past air disasters that occurred at cruise elevation, including the 2009 Air France Flight 447 crash over the Atlantic Ocean. \n \n Another possibility is some type of catastrophic metal fatigue caused by the cycle of pressurization and depressurization associated with each takeoff and landing cycle. This A320 had had 13,600 takeoffs and landings. Many occurred in humid climate, which speeds corrosion. Still, metal fatigue is unlikely because this plane is only 6 years old. \n \n Finally, there\'s the possibility of terrorism or a mass murder by the pilot. There\'s no evidence of either action, but neither can yet be ruled out. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT DID THE PILOTS SAY TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS? \n \n A: The last communication between the pilot and air traffic control was at 6:12 a.m. Sunday (6:12 p.m. EST Saturday) when the pilot ""asked to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet (11,582 meters)."" The last radar contact occurred three minutes later. There was no distress call. But pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: ISN\'T THIS THE THIRD MALAYSIAN JET TO CRASH THIS YEAR? \n \n A: Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people aboard soon after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8. Its whereabouts and what happened remain one of the biggest mysteries in commercial aviation. Another Malaysia Airlines flight, also a Boeing 777, was shot down over rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine while en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17. All 298 people aboard were killed. AirAsia is also based in Malaysia. Flight 8501 was operated by AirAsia Indonesia, a subsidiary that\'s 49 percent owned by the Malaysian parent company. So technically, it\'s an Indonesian airline. But the AirAsia brand is closely tied to the people of Malaysia. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: IS THERE A CONNECTION AMONG ALL THESE CRASHES? \n \n A: No. It\'s just a very unfortunate year for Southeast Asia. But that doesn\'t stop conspiracy theories from sprouting. Ideas about what happened to Flight 370 — both logical and bizarre — keep appearing. The unsolved nature of that disappearance could generate more attention for Flight 8501 and create a new batch of hypotheses. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: HOW FAR COULD THE JET HAVE FLOWN? \n \n A: Looking at the flight\'s paperwork, the plane had more than 18,000 pounds of jet fuel at takeoff, enough to fly about 3½ hours, according to Phil Derner Jr., the founder of aviation enthusiast website NYCAviation.com and a flight dispatcher for a U.S. airline. He notes that that\'s less fuel than most flights tend to carry from New York to Florida. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT\'S NEXT? \n \n A: Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia are conducting a search-and-rescue operation near Belitung island in the Java Sea, the plane\'s last known whereabouts. Assuming that the jet didn\'t veer far off course, the searchers should find wreckage, which can provide clues about what happened. Investigators will also try to recover the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, which often have the most detailed information about the plane\'s final moments. Those so-called black boxes have homing beacons that help searchers find them. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: IS THE AIRBUS A320 A SAFE JET? \n \n A: The plane is a workhorse of modern aviation. Similar to the Boeing 737, the single-aisle, twin-engine jet is used to connect cities that are between one and five hours apart. Worldwide, 3,606 A320s are in operation, according to Airbus, which also makes nearly identical versions of the plane: The smaller A318 and A319 and the stretched A321. An additional 2,486 of those jets are flying. The A320 family has a good safety record, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, according to the Boeing safety study. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT ABOUT AIRASIA? \n \n A: Low-cost AirAsia has a strong presence in most of Southeast Asia, and it recently expanded into India. Though most of its flights are just a few hours long, it has tried to expand into long-distance flying through its sister airline AirAsia X. None of its subsidiaries has lost a plane before, and it has a generally good safety record. But it does fly in a part of the world where air travel has expanded faster than the number of qualified pilots, mechanics and air traffic controllers. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT ABOUT FLYING IN INDONESIA? \n \n A: The country has had a bumpy safety record. In 2007, the crash rate and safety standards were so bad that the European Union barred all of Indonesia\'s airlines from flying into any of its member countries. Than ban was lifted in 2009. But Indonesia\'s main airline — fast-growing Lion Air — is still banned by the EU. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT\'S IT LIKE TO FLY THROUGH A THUNDERSTORM AT 34,000 FEET? \n \n A: Planes flying through thunderstorms experience severe turbulence, with the aircraft moving up, down, sideways and rolling. Anything not secured can float around in the cabin, bouncing off things and people. Overhead bins can open up, spilling contents. Airsickness is common. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT DO PILOTS DO TO AVOID THUNDERSTORMS? \n \n A: If at all possible, airline pilots fly around thunderstorms, even if it means going far out of their way. Airliners like the A320 typically are equipped with radar that provides highly accurate weather information. Pilots can see a thunderstorm forming from over 100 miles away, giving them time to plot a way around the storm cluster or to look for gaps to fly through. It\'s usually not a problem for commercial planes to go 100 or more miles out of the way. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: HOW HIGH CAN AN A320 SAFELY FLY? AND WHAT IF IT EXCEEDS THAT LIMIT? \n \n A: The A320 is certified to fly up to 39,000 feet, its maximum altitude before its rate of climb begins to erode. The plane has an absolute flight limit of 42,000 feet. But it can begin to experience problems as low as 37,000 feet, depending on temperature and weight, including fuel, cargo and passengers. The plane\'s computers should reveal the maximum altitude at which the plane can fly at its current weight and temperature. Planes that exceed their maximum altitude may lose lift, causing an aerodynamic stall. Or they can experience a pressurization blowout, damaging the plane. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: HOW DOES A PLANE JUST FALL OFF RADAR? \n \n A: It\'s still unclear what traffic controllers saw on their screens when the plane disappeared from radar. Authorities haven\'t said whether they lost only the secondary radar target, which is created by the plane\'s transponder, or whether the primary radar target, created by energy reflected from the plane, was lost as well. If a plane came apart in the air or suffered a loss of electrical power, the secondary target would be lost, but the primary target is often still visible on radar. But if the plane were descending at rate of over 6,000 feet a minute — typical of a plane about to crash — the primary target might be lost as well. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: HOW VITAL IS AIR TRAVEL TO THE REGION? \n \n A: For many people, it\'s the only option. Indonesia is a sprawling archipelago of 250 million people. To get from one island to another, the easiest way is to fly. As the region\'s economy has grown, so have the number of people flying. The International Air Transport Association recently named Indonesia as one of the world\'s five fastest-growing air travel markets, predicting an additional 183 million passengers would take to the sky within two decades. \n \n Routes to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region are predicted by the industry trade group to see an extra 1.8 billion annual passengers by 2034, for an overall market size of 2.9 billion. Within two decades, the region is expected to account for 42 percent of global passenger traffic. \n \n The increase in regional airline traffic reflects rapid economic growth. The International Monetary Fund expects the Southeast Asian economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to grow faster this year and next than anywhere except China, India and sub-Saharan Africa. \n \n ___ \n \n Scott Mayerowitz can be reached at http://twitter.com/GlobeTrotScott \n \n ___ \n \n Lowy contributed from Austin, Texas. Paul Wiseman in Washington also contributed to this report.', '(CNN) -- An oil slick, the sound of a distant ""ping,"" objects in the water, and now this: smoke spotted rising from an island in the Java Sea. \n \n As ships, planes and helicopters scour the waters off Indonesia\'s coast for missing AirAsia Flight QZ8501, there have been several reports of possible signs of the missing plane. \n \n So far, officials say, none of them have panned out. \n \n On Tuesday, search teams will be checking the area where Indonesian navy helicopter crews saw the smoke, the head of search and rescue in the province of Bangka-Belitung told CNN Indonesia. But authorities don\'t know whether there\'s any connection to the missing jet. \n \n Local media in Indonesia reported the smoke was seen on Long Island, one of thousands that make up the archipelago that forms Indonesia. \n \n Searchers have been scanning the water\'s surface for signs of the plane, which went missing with 162 people aboard on Sunday as it flew between the islands of Belitung and Borneo, a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters. \n \n ""Our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea,"" said Bambang Sulistyo, the head of Indonesia\'s search-and-rescue agency. That belief is based on the plane\'s flight track and last known coordinates, he said. \n \n Several possible signs of the missing plane, including an oil slick within the search zone and the sound of a faint ""ping,"" have been discounted, according to Indonesian authorities, who are heading the search. \n \n Indonesia Vice President Jusuf Kalla said there were ""some reports from Australia"" about possible objects found, but it was unclear whether they were from the plane. \n \n Because there is a great deal of traffic along the water in the search area, authorities have cautioned that objects found might have nothing to do with the missing aircraft. \n \n Rescuers say weather was probably a factor in the plane\'s disappearance, and it has made finding traces of the plane more difficult. \n \n Large waves and clouds hampered the search for the plane on Sunday and Monday. \n \n ""It is not easy, of course ... the operation in the sea, especially in the bad weather like this,"" Kalla said. \n \n But Kalla said his country will not give up or set a time limit for the operation. \n \n The search area is expanding, with six zones added to the operation on Tuesday, Sulistyo told reporters. \n \n Now, he said, teams in the air, on sea and on land are searching 13 zones over an area that stretches about 156,000 square kilometers (60,200 square miles). \n \n What role did weather play? \n \n Report: Higher altitude request denied \n \n AirAsia says air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at 7:24 a.m. Sunday, Singapore time (6:24 a.m. in Indonesia). \n \n The plane, flying from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, went missing as it flew over the Java Sea between the islands of Belitung and Borneo -- a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters -- Indonesian authorities said. \n \n Before the plane, an Airbus A320-200, lost contact with air traffic controllers, one of the pilots asked to change course and fly at a higher altitude because of bad weather, officials said. Heavy thunderstorms were reported in the area at the time. \n \n Air traffic control approved the pilot\'s request to turn left but denied permission for the plane to climb to 38,000 feet from 32,000 feet, Djoko Murjatmodjo, an aviation official at the Indonesian Transport Ministry, told the national newspaper Kompas. \n \n The increased altitude request was denied because there was another plane flying at that height, he said. \n \n Djoko suggested that Flight 8501 ascended despite air traffic control denying it permission. \n \n AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said storm clouds caused the pilot to ask for a flight plan change. But he added, ""We don\'t want to speculate whether weather was a factor. We really don\'t know."" \n \n Once the aircraft is found, there will be a proper investigation, Fernandes said. \n \n AirAsia CEO takes to Twitter \n \n Relatives to be flown over search area \n \n Amid the anxious wait, family members of the passengers have attended closed-door briefings with airport and airline officials at the airport in Surabaya. \n \n Oei Endang Sulsilowati and her daughter were looking for information about her brother, his wife and their two children. \n \n ""We don\'t know what to do,"" Sulsilowati said. ""We are just waiting for news."" \n \n A specially chartered plane will fly relatives of passengers over the search area Wednesday, AirAsia Indonesia CEO Sunu Widjatmoko told reporters in Surabaya on Tuesday. \n \n The chartered Airbus A320 that will take families from Surabaya over the zone has room for as many as 180 people, he said. \n \n Some police said authorities were seeking additional materials to help identify passengers, such as photos with close-ups of teeth, DNA, or fingerprints. But police officials later told CNN they were not immediately seeking these materials. \n \n East Java Police have set up a disaster victims identification area at the Surabaya airport. \n \n Of the people on board the passenger jet, 155 are Indonesian, three are South Korean, one is British, one is French, one is Malaysian and one is Singaporean, the airline said. \n \n Eighteen children, including one infant, are among the passengers, the carrier said. Seven of the people on board are crew members. \n \n Families of AirAsia flight passengers given support through the \'nightmare\' \n \n International search team \n \n Since the flight disappeared in Indonesian airspace, Indonesia is heading up search efforts. \n \n More than 1,100 search and rescue personnel from Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand are joining the search alongside Indonesia\'s teams, CNN Indonesia reported. \n \n The missing plane is made by Airbus, a French company. And France has dispatched two investigators to Indonesia. They are due to arrive in Jakarta on Monday, France\'s Foreign Ministry said. \n \n Malaysia\'s transportation minister said his country has deployed three vessels and three aircraft to assist in the search. And the Royal Australian Air Force said Monday that it was deploying a patrol plane to help. \n \n The USS Sampson is on its way to the Java Sea to assist in the search for the missing AirAsia plane, a senior U.S. military official told CNN Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto. The Sampson, a guided-missile destroyer based in San Diego, deployed in October to take part in ""maritime security exercises and training"" in the Pacific. \n \n China will dispatch aircraft and ships to participate in search and rescue efforts, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said Tuesday. \n \n The MH370 mystery \n \n AirAsia, a successful budget airline group headquartered in Malaysia, had a clean safety record until the disappearance of Flight 8501. The missing plane is operated by the company\'s Indonesian affiliate. \n \n The loss of contact with the plane comes nearly 10 months after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which dropped off radar over Southeast Asia on March 8 with 239 people on board. \n \n AirAsia and MH370 cases are very different \n \n Searchers have yet to find any remains of Flight 370, which officials believe went down in the southern Indian Ocean after mysteriously flying thousands of kilometers away from its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. \n \n But some aviation experts don\'t think the search for Flight 8501 will be as challenging as the hunt for MH370. \n \n ""We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,"" CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said.

Azieza Uhnavy also contributed to this report.']",2,"– The disappearance of another jet in Southeast Asia while the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 remains a mystery comes as a shock to the aviation world, but experts stress that the two cases are very different. The New York Times runs through some of the differences with AirAsia Flight 8501: Unlike with Flight 370, there has been no sign that anybody on Flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems, meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search. Flight 370 disappeared on a clear night, while Flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather, with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route. The AirAsia pilot's last communication with air traffic control was a request ""to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet."" Flight 370's pilot was very experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying time, while the combined experience of Flight 8501's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that. Neither Flight 370 nor Flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call, but, as the AP notes, ""pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free,"" and there's no sign that the AirAsia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the Malaysia Airlines flight did. Another major difference is the search area for Flight 8501, which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for Flight 370. ""We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,"" says CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. ""We are talking about congested airspace around Southeast Asia. There will be much better radar coverage. There's certainly better air traffic control coverage."""

(YouTube/DC Metropolitan Police Department) \n \n D.C. police said Saturday night that they are seeking a person of interest in the deaths of four people in a house in an upscale neighborhood in Northwest Washington. \n \n Police said the individual may have been operating a Porsche automobile linked to the house. \n \n They also provided video footage that appeared to show a man wearing a hoodie moving rapidly behind a building. \n \n The announcement came in the deaths of Savvas and Amy Savopoulos and two others, believed to be their son and one of their housekeepers. \n \n The Savopoulos family had been having a busy week. The husband was trying to get a new martial arts center in Chantilly, Va., ready for a grand opening, and he enlisted the help of one of his housekeepers. His wife was ill, and their 10-year-old son was recovering from injuries suffered in a go-kart crash. \n \n Savvas Savopoulos and Amy Savopoulos at the Starlight Children’s Foundation MidAtlantic’s Wine Dinner in 2008. (Tony Powell/Washington Life Magazine) \n \n Before the late night police announcement, the days and hours leading up to the deaths of the husband and wife and the two others had come into sharper focus Saturday with new details from police records. They show attempts by friends and relatives to reach the victims Thursday morning, before they were found dead that afternoon in a burning home in Northwest Washington. \n \n These records show a series of text messages and voice mails from both Savopouloses to the housekeeper who had been helping in Chantilly, telling her not to come clean at their D.C. home Thursday, as was her normal routine. Savvas Savopoulos also let her know in a Wednesday night voicemail that the housekeeper who was later found dead had planned to stay overnight at the family’s home and asked that she inform the woman’s family because her cellphone battery had died. \n \n Nelitza Gutierrez, the housekeeper who received the messages and has worked for the family for 20 years, said in an interview Saturday that the series of messages left her with the impression that something was amiss with her employers. She said Savvas Savopoulos told her in person Wednesday that his wife had plans to go out, but said in the voice mail left that night that Amy Savopoulos had been sick in bed all day. \n \n “It was something very suspicious because I felt his voice was really tense,” Gutierrez said in Spanish. “And it was different than what he had said to me before.” \n \n She said she first listened to the message Thursday morning and immediately called Amy Savopoulos “to see if she was okay, but she never answered.” \n \n The police documents also show what appears to be an unusual amount of activity last week around the victims’ Woodland Drive NW home. Neighbors reported seeing a man banging on the door of one home, an aggressive vacuum cleaner salesman at another house, reports of a prowler, and what a witness said could have been the Savopouloses’ blue Porsche speeding down the street the day before the deaths were discovered. \n \n Police have been sorting through a great deal of potential evidence in an effort to learn what happened to Savvas Savopoulos, 46, his wife, Amy, 47, and the two others, tentatively identified as the couple’s 10-year-old son, Philip, and a 57-year-old housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, of Silver Spring, Md. \n \n Police have said all four deaths are being investigated as homicide. They said Friday that three victims had wounds. They said the family’s Porsche 911, which was missing for several hours Thursday, was found burned in a church parking lot in Hyattsville, and that the fire at the home was intentionally set. \n \n The deaths have shocked this enclave of Upper Northwest Washington and the District’s society circles. The couple were active donors to both social and political causes, and attended St. Sophia Greek Orthodox \xadCathedral. Savvas Savopoulos was president and chief executive of American Iron Works, a leading custom steel and iron manufacturing company that helped build Verizon Center and CityCenterDC. \n \n Relatives of the Savopouloses have spoken briefly about the family and the incident, but they have been too overwrought for more in-depth interviews. The couple have two surviving daughters — Abigail Savopoulos is a senior at Mercersburg Academy, an elite private school in Pennsylvania, and is scheduled to graduate this week, and Katerina is a junior at Peddie School near Princeton, N.J. Their youngest child, Philip, was a student at St. Albans School in the District. \n \n Gutierrez, who was close with Figueroa, said her friend had planned to soon return to her native El Salvador. She said Figueroa was at her wedding, and that she was there for her baby shower and, later, her daughter’s first communion. \n \n D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said Friday that police were still working on a timeline, and looking for a motive. It remains unclear whether anything was taken from the two-story red brick house. Lanier said detectives were working to track the Porsche, and asked anyone who saw it Wednesday or Thursday to contact police. \n \n Police records also show Savvas Savopoulos working hard last week getting the Chantilly project ready for a Friday opening. The Chantilly property was closed Saturday but a business owner who works nearby said he has seen recent activity there. \n \n Gutierrez said in the interview that Savvas Savopoulos had asked her to help at the studio on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, instead of at the couple’s home on Thursday. \n \n On Wednesday night, Gutierrez told police, she got the voice mail from Savvas Savopoulos saying that his wife was sick and Philip was home from school with an injury. He told her that Figueroa was going to stay the night to help, but that her phone had died and she had no charger. He asked the housekeeper to call Figueroa’s relatives to relay the message. \n \n In an interview, she said she had never known Figueroa to stay overnight at the home and thought it was odd. “Never, never did she stay over.” \n \n Also Thursday morning, one of Savopoulos’s assistants apparently left a package outside the Woodland Drive house, according to the police records. That person then drove to Chantilly and was there through the day. And at roughly the same time, Figueroa’s husband went to the house to check on his wife. There apparently was no answer. \n \n Minutes before 10 a.m., Gutierrez got a text message from Amy Savopoulos: “I am making sure you do not come today.” Gutierrez, who was then cleaning another home in McLean, replied that she would not be coming, per Savvas Savopoulos’s earlier orders, according to the police documents. \n \n Victoria St. Martin contributed to this report']",2,"– Police are no longer seeking the whereabouts of a blue Porsche after a quadruple murder in an upscale Washington, DC, neighborhood—but they've released video of a ""person of interest"" who may have been driving it before it was found burning behind a church. In surveillance video, a hooded figure in dark clothing can be seen moving outside the house where Savvas and Amy Savopoulos were found dead after a fire on Thursday, NBC Washington reports. Two other bodies found in the home are believed to be the couple's 10-year-old son, Philip, and Veralicia Figueroa, one of their housekeepers. Their other housekeeper, Nelitza Gutierrez, tells the Washington Post that she thought something odd was going on Wednesday when she received messages asking her not to come in the next day. Gutierrez says Savvas Savopoulos gave conflicting information in different messages and sounded unlike himself. ""It was something very suspicious because I felt his voice was really tense,"" she tells the Post. ""And it was different than what he had said to me before."" She says she also found it strange that Savopoulos said Figueroa was spending the night at the home, something she had never known to happen before. Deepening the mystery, police documents seen by the Post detail some strange events in the surrounding area that week, including reports of a possible prowler, a man banging at the door of a home, and an ""aggressive vacuum cleaner salesman"" at another home."
118,"[""Login credentials for as many as 117 million LinkedIn accounts have been put up for sale online by someone who is seeking more than $2,200 for the haul, a security researcher said. \n \n Further Reading 8 million leaked passwords connected to LinkedIn, dating website The credentials—which include e-mail addresses and passwords hashed using the woefully weak SHA1 function—appear to come from a 2012 breach of the career networking site, researcher Troy Hunt said in a series of tweets. LinkedIn officials have since verified that the 2012 hack was the source and said they are working to invalidate any passwords that may still be actively used on compromised accounts. According to LeakedSource, a site that maintains a database of more than 1.25 billion compromised accounts, the new batch contains data for 167 million accounts. 117 million of the records in the batch include a password field. \n \n The discovery means that the 2012 LinkedIn breach was much bigger than previously believed. At the time, researchers found almost 6.5 million credentials belonging to site users. It's not clear if the new number of affected accounts is news to LinkedIn. In the days following discovery of the 2012 breach, company officials implemented a mandatory password reset for affected users. A statement from company officials on Wednesday saying that they're working to change any passwords still in use leaves open the possibility that they were unaware the number was so high. \n \n According to posts on social media sites, the data was advertised on a dark Web site known as The Real Deal by someone with the user name peace_of_mind. It offers data for 167 million accounts for five bitcoins, which at current exchange rates is worth about $2,200. \n \n In an e-mail, LinkedIn officials wrote: \n \n In 2012, LinkedIn was the victim of an unauthorized access and disclosure of some members' passwords. At the time, our immediate response included a mandatory password reset for all accounts we believe were compromised as a result of the unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, we advised all members of LinkedIn to change their passwords as a matter of best practice. Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012. We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is a result of a new security breach. We take the safety and security of our members' accounts seriously.

The most widely used passcode was 123456, with 753,305 accounts. It was followed by linkedin with 172,523, password with 144,458, 123456789 with 94,314, 12345678 with 63,769, and 111111, with 57,210. Many sites are reluctant to forbid the use of such weak passwords out of a fear of alienating users. The leak underscores just how much a new approach is needed."", ""Quite literally, every day someone gets hacked. Whether that's a telecommunications company having its customer data stolen, or another chain of businesses being ripped for all the credit cards it processes, today one hack just seems to melt into another. \n \n In our series Another Day, Another Hack, we do short posts giving you what you need to know about the hack, so you can figure out whether your bank account, website logins or anything else might be at risk. Because, even if the hack might not be the most sophisticated, real people are still getting fucked over somewhere, and should know about it. \n \n A hacker is trying to sell the account information, including emails and passwords, of 117 million LinkedIn users. \n \n The hacker, who goes by the name “Peace,” told Motherboard that the data was stolen during the LinkedIn breach of 2012. At the time, only around 6.5 million encrypted passwords were posted online, and LinkedIn never clarified how many users were affected by that breach. \n \n Turns out it was much worse than anybody thought. \n \n Peace is selling the data on the dark web illegal marketplace The Real Deal for 5 bitcoin (around $2,200). The paid hacked data search engine LeakedSource also claims to have obtained the data. Both Peace and the one of the people behind LeakedSource said that there are 167 million accounts in the hacked database. Of those, around 117 million have both emails and encrypted passwords. \n \n “It is only coming to the surface now. People may not have taken it very seriously back then as it was not spread,” one of the people behind LeakedSource told me. “To my knowledge the database was kept within a small group of Russians.” \n \n A screenshot of the listing on The Real Deal \n \n LeakedSource provided Motherboard with a sample of almost one million credentials, which included email addresses, hashed passwords, and the corresponding hacked passwords. The passwords were originally encrypted or hashed with the SHA1 algorithm, with no “salt,” which is a series of random digits attached to the end of hashes to make them harder to be cracked. \n \n One of the operators of LeakedSource told Motherboard in an online chat that so far they have cracked “90% of the passwords in 72 hours.” \n \n Troy Hunt, a security researcher who maintains the breach notification site “Have I Been Pwned?,” reached out to some of the victims of the data breach. Two of them confirmed to Hunt that they indeed were users of LinkedIn and that the password he shared with them was the one they were using at the time of the breach. Motherboard was able to confirm a third victim. \n \n One of the victims told Motherboard that the password in the sample was their current one, though he changed it as soon as Hunt reached out no notify him of the breach. \n \n “Having a password out there feels like someone being able to let themselves in to your private space whenever they like, without you knowing,” the victim, who asked to remain anonymous, said in an email. \n \n When reached for comment on Tuesday, LinkedIn spokesperson Hani Durzy told Motherboard that the company’s security team was looking into the incident, but that at the time they couldn’t confirm whether the data was legitimate. Durzy, however, also admitted that the 6.5 million hashes that were posted online in 2012 were not necessarily all of the passwords stolen. \n \n “We don’t know how much was taken,” Durzy told me in a phone call. \n \n The lesson: For LinkedIn, the lesson is the same as four years ago: don’t store passwords in an insecure way. As for LinkedIn users, if you didn’t already change your password four years ago, change it again, especially if you use it on other services (and please stop reusing passwords). \n \n “The prevalence of password reuse means we’ll see that unlock other accounts too,” Hunt told me. \n \n Another lesson is that even old hacked data can sometimes be valuable, given that some of these passwords might still be valid. \n \n UPDATE, May 18, 12:32 p.m. ET: LinkedIn confirmed on Wednesday that the new data is legitimate. \n \n “Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of more than 100 million LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012,“ the company's chief information security officer Cory Scott wrote in a blog post. “We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is as a result of a new security breach.“ \n \n Scott also encouraged users to use two-factor authentication and use strong passwords."", 'A LinkedIn hack from back in 2012 is still causing problems for its users. The company announced this morning that another data set from the hack, which contains over 100 million LinkedIn members’ emails and passwords, has now been released. In response to this new data dump, LinkedIn says it’s working to validate the accounts and contact affected users so they can reset their passwords on the site. \n \n As you may or may not recall, given how much time has passed, hackers broke into LinkedIn’s network back in 2012, stole some 6.5 million encrypted passwords, and posted them onto a Russian hacker forum. Because the passwords were stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes, hundreds of thousands were quickly cracked. \n \n Now, according to a new report from Motherboard, a hacker going by the name of “Peace” is trying to sell the emails and passwords of 117 million LinkedIn members on a dark web illegal marketplace for around $2,200, payable in bitcoin. In total, the data set includes 167 million accounts, but of those, only 117 million or so have both emails and encrypted passwords. \n \n As this data set also originates from the 2012 hack, these passwords are encrypted in the same way – with “no salt” – meaning they are more easily cracked. In fact, Motherboard states that 90 percent of the passwords were cracked within 72 hours. Several of the victims were still using their same password from 2012, the report also said. \n \n Whether or not current LinkedIn users should be concerned comes down to a handful of factors: did you have an account during the time of the 2012 breach, have you changed your password since, and has that password been reused on other websites? \n \n If you’re not sure, a best practice would be to change it anyway, as well as on other critical sites where you may be using that same password such as your banking website, email, or Facebook, for example. \n \n LinkedIn says that it has increased its security measures in the years since the breach, by introducing stronger encryption, email challenges and two-factor authentication. But this hack was from an earlier era, before these protections were in place. They would also not necessarily protect users from hackers who had obtained email and password combinations. \n \n The full text of LinkedIn’s statement is below:']",3,"– In 2012, hackers posted 6.5 million stolen LinkedIn passwords to a Russian forum, TechCrunch reports. It turns out, that security breach was much bigger and much worse than possibly anyone realized. According to Motherboard, 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords taken as part of the same breach were just put up for sale by a hacker named ""Peace,"" who is seeking $2,200 for them on the dark web. LinkedIn has confirmed the emails and passwords are legit and is working on contacting affected users. Back in 2012, LinkedIn never specified how many accounts had been compromised by hackers. Ars Technica reports it's possible even the company didn't know how many passwords had been stolen initially. Hackers have apparently had no trouble with the lightly encrypted passwords. One source claims hackers cracked 90% of the stolen passwords within 72 hours. Ars Technica argues many of the passwords should never have been allowed by LinkedIn in the first place. More than 750,000 users had the password ""123456."" More than 170,000 used ""linkedin."" Other popular passwords were ""password"" and ""111111."" People who were using LinkedIn in 2012, still have the same password, and use that password for other websites should be concerned, according to TechCrunch, which says it's best to change your password on LinkedIn (and anywhere else you used it) just in case."
119,"['Michaela Myers said she was first groped by her supervisor after a crew pizza party last summer, shortly after starting a new job as a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service. She was 22 and excited about the job. She had worked out diligently to prepare for the season, running and hiking with a heavy pack. She is from the Pacific Northwest, and had always loved the outdoors and a challenge. \n \n She remembers her supervisor, a Forest Service veteran, offering her beers at a crew member’s house after dinner. He told her he was glad she was on the crew because she was “sexy” and had “a nice ass,” she said. According to her account, he led her to a couch, rubbed her butt as she sat down, and slid his hand between her legs. Myers was shocked and upset, but didn’t stop him. She had heard from other crew members that this manager could fly off the handle, and didn’t want to make a scene. \n \n “You don’t feel like you can say ‘no’ loudly to your supervisor,” she said. “I keep looking back on it and wishing I could have just punched him or something.” \n \n “I keep looking back on it and wishing I could have just punched him or something.” \n \n According to Myers, the harassment and groping continued for the rest of the summer. When she confided in a fellow crew member, he told her this was an unfortunate reality for a female firefighter. She had a choice, she recalls him saying: report it and face retaliation, or do nothing and stay in fire. \n \n But in September, after the end of her three-month season in Oregon, Myers had enough. She reported the harassment to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service’s parent agency. In October, she provided a sworn statement to a USDA investigator detailing all the allegations. At first, Myers found the Human Resource department’s response encouraging. She was optimistic action would be taken. But two months later, the Forest Service sent her a letter that said the investigation was complete, no misconduct had been found, and the case was closed. \n \n Myers was furious. \n \n “This means they don’t believe me that I was sexually harassed,” she said. “Or they don’t care.” \n \n When reached by phone, the manager, who still works for the Forest Service, said he was made aware of the allegations. “I was cleared of all wrongdoing,” he said. \n \n ‘We all live in this fear’ \n \n Harassment of women in the Forest Service has been a problem for years. As far back as 1972, women have joined together to file class action complaints and lawsuits about gender discrimination and sexual harassment. More recently, in 2016, a congressional hearing was held to address the problem within the Forest Service’s California workforce, which had also been the focus of previous complaints. The PBS NewsHour investigated what’s happened since then, and found the problem goes much deeper. \n \n Firefighter Darla Bush said her career “spiraled downhill” after she notified her supervisor that she was pregnant with twins in 2011. Video by Joshua Barajas \n \n In interviews with 34 current and former U.S. Forest Service women, spanning 13 states, the women described a workplace that remains hostile to female employees. They complained of a pattern of gender discrimination, bullying, sexual harassment and assault by crew members and supervisors. Three women said they were raped after-hours by co-workers or interagency firefighters while working for the Forest Service. Many women alleged retaliation after reporting these incidents. \n \n The retaliation they described took different forms: verbal threats, bullying notes, duties stripped, negative performance reviews, and demotions. Myers applied to work another season with the Forest Service and said she received interest from several states, but not Oregon, where she reported the abuse. ‘It’s like I’m on some Oregon blacklist, the Oregon #MeToo blacklist,” she said. \n \n Watch our complete series on harassment and retaliation in the U.S. Forest Service. Video by Lorna Baldwin, Emily Carpeaux and William Brangham \n \n Some women interviewed said they never reported the harassment for fear of retaliation. In a survey of nearly 2,000 Forest Service employees in California, conducted by the USDA Office of Inspector General last summer, the majority of respondents said they knew of the agency’s “zero tolerance” policy for harassment. But the survey, released in February 2018, also showed that most who experienced harassment did not report it, either because they didn’t trust the reporting process, didn’t believe that the process would be confidential, or feared a negative impact on their job. \n \n “We all live in this fear … So if I have to speak up I will. But it’s frustrating because there’s so many more out there who are not talking.” \n \n Seven of the 34 women interviewed asked to remain anonymous for fear of further retaliation. Fear was a common theme in the interviews. One woman said she went to the hospital multiple times for “her nerves” after reporting harassment. Another asked the NewsHour to destroy her interview transcript, because she became too afraid of the consequences. A third, a firefighter who resigned from her position in 2016 after she reported to police that she was raped on assignment in Montana, said: “We all live in this fear … So if I have to speak up I will. But it’s frustrating because there’s so many more out there who are not talking.” \n \n Reporting harassment \n \n In interviews, Forest Service employees, union representatives, lawyers, and congressional investigators said the agency struggles with a long-standing “boys’ club” culture, not just in California, but all over the country. Women are often assigned to remote forests, where they may work in close quarters with male-dominated crews in high-risk scenarios. Socializing after hours can involve heavy drinking. Many women described the worst offenses in the agency’s wildland firefighting division, where the gender disparity is even greater: 6,633 fire employees are male, while just 890, or 13 percent, are female. \n \n Debra D’Agostino, a federal employment lawyer who has represented at least five Forest Service women with gender discrimination complaints, said: “The stories I hear from female firefighters really sound like they are from the 1970s. It’s really old-fashioned sexist conduct that you just don’t expect to see these days.” \n \n U.S. Forest Service Acting Associate Chief Lenise Lago said the agency is “on the right track.” In November 2017, she said, it created a harassment reporting center with a toll-free hotline. And later this year, the agency will for the first time require every employee to undergo identical sexual harassment training. \n \n The Forest Service declined to comment on specific cases due to privacy, but said it takes “all reports of sexual harassment very seriously.” \n \n “There are more numerous people doing the right thing than not,” Lago said. \n \n In the private sector, employees can file discrimination complaints directly with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent agency tasked with investigating workplace discrimination. But federal employees, including those in the Forest Service, must first contact their agency’s EEO counselor, who starts an investigation and then makes a decision with the agency on how to handle the complaint. Federal employees dissatisfied with the results can appeal that decision to the EEOC or pursue a case in federal district court. \n \n Many of the women interviewed described the reporting process as long, complicated, and never ending in a satisfying conclusion. Investigations can take years and stretch into hundreds of pages, especially if there is more than one allegation. \n \n The EEOC said the average processing time for all complaints in fiscal year 2016 was 464 days, and that it’s exploring ways to shorten the process. The Forest Service’s new hotline, which is staffed by contractors specifically trained to handle sexual harassment, aims to more efficiently respond to these claims. \n \n Joe Duran, a union leader in California who has been with the Forest Service for more than 40 years, said: “I take an awful lot of phone calls with individuals … All I can do is give them counsel and advice. I’ll say, ‘you have to go through this or move on. And if you go the EEO route that could be years.’ That really tears them apart … People want to know why.” \n \n But Duran said an even bigger issue is the retaliation people face after reporting bad behavior. “The ones that do [report] are harassed or reprised or stuck away someplace,” he said. And management does sometimes investigate this reprisal, he said, but “you’ll never hear the outcomes.” \n \n ‘You are a prime example of why women don’t belong in fire’ \n \n Last summer, one woman in the South was startled from the start of her season by the behavior of the men on her hotshot crew, an elite team that fights wildfires. The woman, who is 27 and asked for anonymity because she continues to work for the Forest Service, said they made disparaging sexual comments about a former female worker and implied that an EEO complaint had no consequences. “The only thing that EEO taught us is that we can get away with anything,” she recalled one man saying. \n \n Melissa Moore “To be a chick in fire, you have to be excellent” Engine captain \n \n Fremont-Winema National Forest \n \n Oregon Moore, 35, says that while on assignment at the National Wildland Firefighter Apprentice Program in 2015, a student at the academy groped her buttocks and vagina at an after-hours gathering at a local bar. She said she submitted a statement about the incident to the Forest Service. In a statement to Congress, Moore said she was told her allegations had been substantiated, but it wasn’t clear whether action was taken against the perpetrator. “It’s less a culture of harassment than just blatant misogyny. … A lot of men … [aren’t] used to seeing the types of women that would fight fire … To be a chick in fire, you have to be excellent to be good. And if you’re not that, then you just kind of get eaten alive.” \n \n One day in mid-August, according to her records, a senior crew member directed an “emotional outburst” at her after she had trouble keeping up on a hike: “She shouldn’t be here — this is a hotshot crew. She needs to go the f**k home.” \n \n Two weeks later, while fighting a fire in Montana, the woman was struck in the back by a falling fir tree cut down by a fellow crew member. She said he failed to call out a warning as it fell. “I don’t know about if he dropped it intentionally, but he definitely knew I was there and didn’t care. He didn’t care if he hurt me,” she said. \n \n The tree weighed 100 pounds and sprained the ligaments of her lumbar spine, according to medical records. Her supervisor did not initially sign the necessary paperwork required for her medical treatment, according to a Forest Service police report. Patti Adkinson, a workers’ compensation representative who handled the woman’s case, found this disturbing. “My personal opinion is that happened because they were were trying to prove to her that she wasn’t a fit candidate to be a hotshot, so they were trying to make her suffer,” Adkinson said. “Absolutely they were intimidated by her being able to do what they could do.” \n \n In California, firefighter Darla Bush had over the years grown accustomed to bullying, such as men putting lizards on her back or rocks in her pack. For the most part, it didn’t bother her. She put her head down, worked hard, and eventually advanced to the position of engine captain. But everything changed in 2011 when she told her supervisor she was pregnant with twins. According to Bush, who is now 40, he repeatedly told her she was “useless” because her doctor had ordered her to be on light duty. In the years that followed, she said, her duties were stripped away, trainings were denied, and she was ultimately demoted from her engine captain position. “I had a lot to contribute to the district,” she said. “[But] after I got there and reported that I was pregnant, is when my career spiraled downhill. And it’s been nonstop ever since.” Bush said she now sits in an office with almost no duties to perform. She is the lead complainant in a 2014 class action complaint alleging harassment and retaliation in the Forest Service. \n \n Battalion chief Abby Bolt, 39, was raped while on assignment in 2012 in Colorado, by another firefighter who was not with the Forest Service. While she reported the rape to police, she did not report it to the Forest Service because she feared retaliation. “I had previously tried to report some bad behavior that’s not near as bad as sexual assault. So I can’t even imagine if I had reported the rape,” she said. “The Forest Service would have made it so hard on me.” Because she felt she could not trust the formal reporting channel, she confided instead in a fellow firefighter who she saw as a kind of protector. A year later, that friend died while fighting a fire. “And then that piece of security was gone too,” she said. \n \n In the years since, Bolt said she has faced bullying and harassment from her male supervisors, which intensified after she contacted the Forest Service about filing a gender discrimination complaint in 2014. In January 2015, she filed a formal EEO complaint. Her case has been winding its way through that process ever since. \n \n This past fall, Bolt said she received anonymous notes in her mailbox. “You are a prime example of why women don’t belong in fire, especially single mothers,” one of the notes read. “Let it go.” After she reported the notes, she received a letter from management saying the investigation was closed because “there was no accused person to interview.” And then in October, she found “QUIT” scrawled on the back of her dusty vehicle. After getting the notes, she said, “I have sat in my truck, in the parking lot, for hours and hours and actually, days. Like, there’s been days … after the notes that were left, that I couldn’t get out of my truck. I would pull up to the office and I just couldn’t get out.” \n \n Jim Lopez, a union representative who has taken up Bolt’s gender discrimination case, said she is “the epitome of a bullying target — they tend to be high performers, good communicators and they tend to make the supervisors look bad.” \n \n Fire, he said, remains “one of the last strongholds in the Forest Service of male domination,” and of men who don’t want women in their ranks. \n \n Decades of disparity, and efforts to close the gap \n \n The Forest Service was created in 1905 as an arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, though in many ways its mission echoed the goals of the National Parks Service, that of protecting and managing the public lands. Among those duties were firefighting and other responsibilities often seen as grueling tasks, work that a 1971 pamphlet describes as “men who don’t mind roughing it.” \n \n In its early days, the Forest Service did employ women, but they were not expected to do field work. Hallie M. Daggett, the first woman to be employed in fire in the agency, joined in 1913 “after considerable exertion,” according to American Forestry magazine. “Few women would care for such a job, fewer still would seek it,” the magazine wrote. \n \n Janine McFarland “I still love the Forest Service.” Archaeologist \n \n Deschutes National Forest \n \n Oregon \n \n McFarland, 55, said she has filed two dozen harassment and discrimination complaints over the years while working for the Forest Service. In 2002, she reported pornographic photos of women were plastered across work vehicles on the Los Padres National Forest. Afterward, she said, she faced retaliation, including death threats against her and her son. “What the Forest Service is allowing to happen is all this retaliation and reprisal, and then it never gets resolved. Women quit or retire or leave … I still love the Forest Service. Think it’s one of the best agencies in the world. I still believe all that stuff.” \n \n Deanne Shulman, the first female smokejumper in the Forest Service, didn’t gain entry into the agency until 1981, nearly 70 years after Daggett took a post as fire lookout. Smokejumpers are part of an elite crew that jumps out of airplanes and parachutes down to fight fires below. Shulman passed the physical tests, but was initially denied the job because she was told she hadn’t met weight requirements; she was five pounds under the 130-pound minimum. It wasn’t until Shulman filed a formal EEO complaint did the agency open the work to women. \n \n Today, a third of the Forest Service’s nearly 30,000 employees are women, according to the most recent agency figures, updated in January of this year. \n \n Efforts to fix this gender disparity began decades ago. In 1973, Gene Bernardi, a research sociologist with the Forest Service, filed a class action lawsuit against the agency for gender discrimination in California. The suit led the Forest Service to later agree to a “consent decree” that required it to increase the number of women among its California staff to 43 percent, roughly the same percentage of women in the civilian workforce at the time. \n \n The decree bred resentment among male Forest Service employees. In 1991, a bitter male fire captain wrote to The Hartford Courant newspaper, saying that the decree’s requirements were “tearing the agency apart, creating animosity and mistrust between men and women … and lowering the agency’s ability to do its job.” A group of male employees attempted to challenge the decree, but it was dismissed in court a year earlier. \n \n Jonel Wagoner, one of the “Bernardi women” hired after the 1981 decree, said she retired last year after 37 seasons due to the mistreatment she endured. \n \n “This agency, they just detest women, do not want women in their ranks. They hate educated strong women,” said the former firefighter, who is 57, and who also represented harassed women as a union representative. “If you’re not going to be one of the good old boys, you’re going to fail.” \n \n A second class action lawsuit came in 1995 when two female former Forest Service employees alleged sexual harassment and reprisal on behalf of 6,000 women, also in California. The lawsuit led to another decree, requiring that the agency re-evaluate how it processed complaints. That decree expired in 2006. \n \n And in 2014, a class action complaint was filed with the EEOC, claiming — again — sexual harassment of and retaliation against women in the Forest Service in California. That same year, California Rep. Jackie Speier recalls sending one of her staffers to a meeting with Forest Service officials. Media reports at the time pointed to continued problems with sexual misconduct within the agency. After the meeting, Speier said the staffer returned to the D.C. office “demonstrably shocked” and in disbelief. \n \n When the staffer asked Forest Service officials about the sexual misconduct, she recalled to the NewsHour, they responded with the sentiment of “Boys will be boys.” \n \n Two years later, the National Parks Service was flagged by the Interior Department for similar problems. At the time, then-Forest Service Chief Thomas Tidwell told employees in an agency-wide email that stories of sexual abuse within the Forest Service were mostly “older allegations.” \n \n Darlene Hall, who is 53, and one of three named complainants in the 2014 case, said that isn’t true. To her, the misbehavior today is as bad or worse, just more covert than in the past. The message remains clear, she said: “You’re female, you don’t belong here. Speak up, and you get hammered.” \n \n Lack of follow-up \n \n In December 2016, the congressional hearing was held to publicly address the concerns of rampant sexual misconduct, assault and discrimination within Region 5 — the California arm — of the Forest Service. \n \n At the hearing, Lesa Donnelly, an early class action complainant and a whistleblower who has advised many California-based Forest Service women, shared story after story of misconduct she’d heard. Forest Service firefighter Denice Rice also testified about her own experience, detailing that her supervisor had asked for sex, stalked her, and poked her breasts with a letter opener. “The instant I filed” a complaint, she said, “everything changed.” Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle grilled the agency about their poor record of responding to these issues. \n \n In her opening statement, Lago, then-deputy chief of business operations at the Forest Service, defended the agency, saying: “We investigate all allegations. We hold people accountable.” \n \n Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, vowed that members would “use every power we possibly can from this pulpit” to ensure that women “never have to go through that again in any way shape or form.” \n \n Your browser does not support HTML5 video. \n \n A “Thank you, firefighters” sign seen on the way into the Los Padres National Forest in southern California. Video by Joshua Barajas \n \n But more than a year later, there’s been little follow-up from the Hill. The Office of the Inspector General is expected to release an audit in April that will evaluate how well the Forest Service has addressed complaints of workplace misconduct. \n \n The Forest Service, for its part, said it updated its anti-harassment policy ahead of the hearing, in September 2016, and launched the national hotline the following November. Since the new anti-harassment policy was put in place, the agency said, it has received 1,013 reports of harassment, and completed inquiries or investigations in 632 of those cases. Of those, the agency said it found misconduct in 150 cases. \n \n For every misconduct finding, the agency said it delivered a corrective action that ranged from a warning letter to termination, “depending on the severity and facts gathered in each case,” Babete Anderson, an agency spokeswoman, wrote in an email. \n \n Darla Bush “Once you say something....you get a target on your back” Fire operations specialist \n \n Sequoia National Forest \n \n California Bush, 40, is the lead complainant in a 2014 class action complaint with the EEOC that alleges a culture of harassment and retaliation in the Forest Service. She fears speaking up will jeopardize her retirement, which is seven years away. “Once you say something, there’s no shutting that door and you get a target on your back. It’s been my experience [that] if you open your mouth and you speak up in regards to your standards or what should be right or wrong, there’s no going back.” \n \n But nearly every female Forest Service employee the NewsHour spoke with said they did not believe the hotline was fixing anything. Wagoner, who remembers a previous Forest Service hotline in California that later went away, said she had seen women retaliated against for calling. Bolt, the battalion chief in California who received the harassing notes, said she submitted more than one complaint to the new hotline and never received any follow up. \n \n Frustrated, Bolt sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the USDA to try to figure out what happened to her hotline complaints. She received a letter back from the USDA that said the FOIA office had a backlog, and said she hasn’t received any correspondence since. \n \n The ones who leave \n \n Nearly all of the women interviewed said they loved the Forest Service. They loved the mission of protecting forests. The time outside. The adrenaline of fighting fires. The dirty work. The camaraderie. And the skill required. For these reasons, despite the harassment they faced, many of them chose to stay. \n \n But there were also the women who quit or were pushed out, and never returned. \n \n At first, Erinn Whitmer loved her job as a seasonal firefighter. She was an adrenaline junkie who always wanted to be outdoors. And she grew up in Northern California, in wildfire country, where her home was twice evacuated for fires. “I grew up near fire crews,” she said, and admired them. “But I didn’t realize how naive I was to the culture.” \n \n Whitmer worked eight seasons in fire for public land agencies: first the Park Service, then the Bureau of Land Management, and then the Forest Service in California. She soon saw what she called a “womanizing” culture in all three — but the Forest Service was the worst, she said. There, crew members constantly talked about sex and pressured women for it. Hard-drinking seemed part of being on the crew. One night in November 2011, according to a police report at the time and later sworn testimony to a Forest Service investigator, Whitmer and her coworkers drank for several hours at a local bar. Things started to get fuzzy from there. She remembers hanging out with several people back at the barracks, and one crew member talking his way up to her room. Her next memory is waking up in her bed and realizing he was having sex with her. \n \n “I just want these guys to stop getting these women drunk and using them for sex…” \n \n “I heard stories … I never thought these terrible things would happen to me,” she scrawled in the margins of her typed testimony in September 2013, which she sent back to the investigator. “I just want these guys to stop getting these women drunk and using them for sex…” and: “I’m not the only female who has gone through this hell.” \n \n Whitmer, who is now 37, did not ever press charges, telling police she didn’t want to ruin his life. But she was was shocked in 2013 when she was assigned to the same fire as the crew member. \n \n “This was my first contact with [him] since the incident,” she wrote in a December 2013 letter she said she shared as part of an EEO complaint. “I did not know until we were in route [sic] to the fire that [he] would be there … I did not know I would have such a strong reaction to seeing him.” At the fire, she told her squad leader, “I can’t do this,” before she began crying and walked off the fire line. A few weeks after that, she received a letter placing her on administrative leave for “disruptive behavior.” \n \n She ultimately left the Forest Service in late 2013. \n \n Speaking up \n \n A common thread in conversations with all 34 Forest Service women was that the time had come to speak up. Some formed new communities on social media where they talked about how to deal with the harassment. Others filed complaints or spoke to supervisors about harassment for the first time. They said the #MeToo movement factored into why they wanted to talk to the media. \n \n “There’s little girls coming up, and there’s teenagers coming up … that want to be in these jobs,” said Bolt, who in February was suspended, according to her, in part for failure to follow instructions for not drug testing a new mother. “If I lose my job now, but it helps it get a little bit better,” it will have been worth it, she said. \n \n Meanwhile the hotshot crew member who was hit by a falling tree said she was gathering documentation to file her first ever report of misconduct, to the USDA’s Office of the Inspector General. She said she’d frame it as a safety issue, instead of gender discrimination, because she thought that would be more likely to get a response. \n \n Out West, Michaela Myers was offered another firefighting job in the Forest Service, not in Oregon, but with a crew in Washington. She said she’d heard from a network of agency women — and hoped — that it was a better forest in which to work. \n \n And Darla Bush, who said she was told she was useless after getting pregnant, continues to pursue her class action complaint. Today, she has three girls. Two of them want to become firefighters, she said, and then started to cry. “I won’t say it out loud to them, but I would never wish for them to become firefighters. Not in this agency.” \n \n Lorna Baldwin, Emily Carpeaux and William Brangham contributed to this reporting. \n \n Editor’s Note: This story has been updated.

Then he decided to strike his mother in the back of the head with a hammer."" \n \n After the initial blows, Hadley said that his mother turned to him and asked, ""Why?"" \n \n Hadley\'s father came out of the bedroom when he heard his wife scream. \n \n ""Tyler told MM [Mandell] that he and his father stared into each other\'s eyes for a minute.

When they arrived at the home they found Hadley glassy eyed and talkative. When the boy said they couldn\'t come in, the police entered anyway on the possibility that someone inside could be in danger. \n \n The officers found the parents\' bodies in a locked bedroom beneath furniture that had been piled into there from other rooms in the house, the affidavit said. \n \n Mandell told television station WPTV that Hadley had taken three ecstasy pills and didn\'t believe his friend\'s confession until he saw the father\'s body. \n \n ""After he told me I didn\'t believe him, because he\'s been my best friend forever I would never suspect anything like this,"" he told the station. \n \n Mandell\'s mother, Michele Mandell, told ABCNews.com that she had known Hadley for nearly a decade.

Tooke's retirement, which is effective immediately, comes just a few days after a PBS NewsHour investigation into both the Forest Service and Tooke, who informed his staff he'd be leaving in a Wednesday email obtained by Politico and BuzzFeed. While Tooke didn't confirm or deny the allegations against him—allegations that the New York Times says haven't yet been spelled out—he says, ""I cannot combat every inaccuracy that is reported in the news media,"" and therefore feels it's best to ""make way for a new leader that can ensure future success for all employees and the agency.""

The cave in northern Thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in September or October, meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months. Experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys, ages 11 to 16, to safety through miles of dark, narrow, flooded tunnels. ""Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy,"" US National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator Anmar Mirza tells the AP.

All three cities lie close to Ukraine\'s border with Russia. \n \n Interior Minister Arsen Avakov vowed to restore order in eastern Ukraine without using violence and also accused Ukraine\'s ousted president Viktor Yanukovich, whose political base was in Donetsk, of conspiring with Putin to fuel tensions. \n \n ""Putin and Yanukovich ordered and paid for the latest wave of separatist disorder in the east of the country.

Protesters outside cheered and chanted ""Russia! Russia!"". \n \n In the Luhansk protest, Ukrainian television said three people had been injured.

Nine people had been hurt in the disturbances in Luhansk. \n \n Mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine has seen a sharp rise in tension since Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich’s overthrow in February and the advent of an interim government in Kiev that wants closer ties with Europe. \n \n Russia has branded the new leadership in Kiev illegitimate and has annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region, citing threats to its Russian-speaking majority - a move that caused the biggest standoff between Moscow and the West since the end of the Cold War. \n \n YANUKOVICH CALL \n \n The protesters appeared to be responding in part to Yanukovich, who fled to Russia after he was ousted and who on March 28 issued a public call for each of Ukraine’s regions to hold a referendum on its status inside the country. \n \n A pro-Russian protester stands inside the seized regional administrative building in Kharkiv April 6, 2014.

It was not clear why the Russian marine had opened fire. \n \n Yatseniuk said that though much of the unrest had died down in eastern Ukraine in the past month there remained about 1,500 “radicals” in each region who spoke with “clear Russian accents” and whose activity was being coordinated through foreign intelligence services. \n \n But he said Ukrainian authorities had drawn up a plan to handle the crisis. \n \n “We have a clear action plan,” he said, adding that senior officials would head to the towns concerned. \n \n Avakov on Sunday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of orchestrating the “separatist disorder” and promised that disturbances would be brought under control without violence. \n \n Russia has been pushing internationally a plan proposing the “federalization” of Ukraine in which regions of the country of 46 million would have broad powers of autonomy. \n \n Slideshow (9 Images) \n \n Ukraine, while drawing up its own blueprint of constitutional changes for ‘de-centralization’ in which smaller municipalities would be able to develop their own areas by retaining a portion of state taxes raised, says the Russian plan is aimed at breaking up the country. \n \n Referring to the Russian plan, Yatseniuk said: “It is an attempt to destroy Ukrainian statehood, a script which has been written in the Russian Federation, the aim of which is to divide and destroy Ukraine and turn part of Ukraine into a slave territory under the dictatorship of Russia,” he said. \n \n “This is not going to happen,” he said. \n \n “I appeal to the people and the elites of the east.

The corresponding bill was read at the council’s session. \n \n “The territory of the republic within the recognized borders is indivisible and inviolable,” the council said. The legislators also passed a decision on holding a referendum on whether or not the region should join the Russian Federation. It will be held no later than May 11. \n \n On this background, residents of the city of Donetsk were holding an action of protest in front of the building of the Regional State Administration.

The relevant decision was unanimously adopted by the upper house of Russian parliament at an extraordinary session. Earlier, Vladimir Putin submitted to the Federation Council an address on using the armed forces of Russia on the territory of Ukraine until the normalization of the socio-political situation in that country. This initiative was proposed with regard to a plea by Ukraine’s legitimate president Viktor Yanukovych. \n \n Later the Ukrainian leader said that the address to Vladimir Putin regarding the use of armed forces was triggered by the bout of armed delinquency in Ukraine. “I’ve done it for a reason, because I became target of the criminals. Armed gangs started to cruise around the country. In particular, they pursued me on the territory of Ukraine,” he said.', 'MOSCOW — Under the attentive eye of Russian state television, several hundred pro-Russian demonstrators in the city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, declared on Monday that they were forming an independent republic and urged President Vladimir V. Putin to send troops to the region as a peacekeeping force, even though there was no imminent threat to peace. \n \n The actions in Donetsk and two other main cities in eastern Ukraine, which included demands for a referendum on seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia, seemed an effort by the activists to mimic some of the events that preceded Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea. However, there were no immediate indications that the Kremlin was receptive to the pleas. \n \n While widely regarded as political theater supported if not directed by the Kremlin, the protests could help promote what analysts say is Russia’s primary goal of destabilizing the shaky government in Kiev, preventing it from drifting further into the West’s orbit and giving Moscow leverage over the country’s future ahead of presidential elections in May. \n \n The turmoil in eastern Ukraine also makes it extremely difficult for the provisional government in Kiev to begin putting in place an array of austerity measures and financial overhauls required by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for an $18 billion loan package that the country desperately needs to avert a financial default.']",5,"– Crimea first, eastern Ukraine next?

ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN, citing unidentified law enforcement... (Associated Press) \n \n MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Investigators are looking into whether Prince died from an overdose and whether a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before he was found dead at his home in suburban Minneapolis, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Thursday. \n \n The official said that among the things investigators are looking at is whether a doctor was on a plane that made an emergency landing in Illinois less than a week before Prince died. \n \n The law enforcement official has been briefed on the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \n \n The official said investigators are also looking into what kind of drugs were on the plane and at Prince\'s house in suburban Minneapolis. \n \n The official also confirmed some details that have previously been reported by other media outlets, including TMZ. \n \n Prince\'s plane made an emergency stop in Moline, in western Illinois, on April 15 and he was found unconscious on the plane, the official said. The person said first responders gave Prince a shot of Narcan, which is used in suspected opioid overdoses. The official said the so-called save shot was given to when the plane was on the tarmac in Moline as Prince returned to Minneapolis following a performance in Atlanta. \n \n The official said investigators are looking at whether Prince overdosed on the plane and whether an overdose killed him, and at what kind of drugs were involved. One possibility is the powerful painkiller Percocet or something similar, the official said. \n \n Narcan can be used on people even if an overdose isn\'t confirmed because it wouldn\'t necessarily be harmful. \n \n While it\'s premature to say where the investigation is heading, the mention of a doctor calls to mind other celebrity deaths, including Michael Jackson\'s. Jackson\'s doctor, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for his role in prescribing a powerful anesthetic that contributed to the pop star\'s death in 2009. \n \n A second law enforcement official told AP that prescription drugs were discovered at Prince\'s home when the musician was found dead on April 21. \n \n That official spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak about the ongoing investigation into Prince\'s death. The official did not elaborate. An autopsy has been performed, but results aren\'t expected for three to four weeks. The search warrant for Prince\'s Paisley Park home and studio — carried out the day of his death — was filed Thursday under seal at the request of investigators who said it would hamper their investigation if contents were public. \n \n An affidavit in support of sealing the warrant, signed by Carver County Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud, also warned that disclosing details in the warrant could cause ""the search or related searches to be unsuccessful"" and risk injury to innocent people. \n \n Kamerud declined to comment Thursday on the reports of drugs found at Paisley Park, and told AP that he strongly disputed reports by several media outlets that investigators had asked the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for help in the case. \n \n ""We have not asked them for help, or asked them to be a part of the investigation,"" Kamerud said. ""We might contact them to help us, but that hasn\'t happened. We don\'t have the medical examiner\'s report yet. We don\'t know to what extent pharmaceuticals could be a part of this."" \n \n Leo Hawkins, a DEA spokesman in Chicago, said he had no comment. \n \n Prince\'s death came two weeks after he canceled concerts in Atlanta, saying he wasn\'t feeling well. He played a pair of makeup shows April 14 in that city. Prince was scheduled to perform two shows in St. Louis but canceled them shortly before his death due to health concerns. \n \n Longtime friend and collaborator Sheila E. has told the AP that Prince had physical issues from performing, citing hip and knee problems that she said came from years of jumping off risers and stage speakers in heels. \n \n ___ \n \n Tarm reported from Chicago. Tucker reported from Washington, D.C.', ""Video (02:04) : The Twin Cities erupted in memories, grief and song after the passing of Minnesota's brightest star. \n \n The investigation of Prince’s death took a turn Thursday indicating that the megastar’s collapse on April 21 is now the focus of a criminal probe. \n \n In a three-page incident report, the Carver County Sheriff’s Office cited an exception to Minnesota public-records laws that allows it to suppress information relating to a “criminal” probe in deciding to release only scant information about the 911 response to the Paisley Park complex in Chanhassen that morning. \n \n The law says that “investigative data collected or created by a law enforcement agency in order to prepare a case against a person, whether known or unknown, for the commission of a crime or other offense for which the agency has primary investigative responsibility are confidential or protected nonpublic while the investigation is active.” \n \n The exception citation doesn’t mean that criminal charges will be filed at the completion of the Sheriff’s Office inquiry, only that charges are a possibility. \n \n Sources with direct knowledge of the case have told the Star Tribune that they are investigating whether an overdose of opioids led to Prince’s death. Prescription pills were found at Paisley Park, but sources have said it was unclear whether they were prescribed to Prince. As part of the probe, investigators also are trying to determine how Prince got the pills, and who may have provided them. \n \n Authorities have said that Prince was alone when he died and that neither foul play nor suicide is suspected. \n \n Fans braved the rain and 40-degree temperatures Thursday to visit the Prince memorial at Paisley Park in Chanhassen. \n \n Carver County Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud, who released the report, said Thursday that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration is not involved in the investigation at this time. Sheriff Jim Olson and County Attorney Mark Metz didn’t respond for comment. \n \n The incident report, released a week after the musician’s death, provides little detail that wasn’t already made public by law enforcement authorities. It doesn’t identify who made the 911 call or if anybody in the building talked to investigators after Prince’s death. \n \n Timeline of the 911 call \n \n The report did reveal the time frame for the emergency response to Paisley Park that morning. Twenty-four minutes elapsed between the 911 call reporting an “unresponsive adult male” at Paisley Park and Prince being pronounced dead, according to the report. \n \n The 911 call from the music studio was made at 9:43 a.m. Sheriff’s deputies and emergency personnel from the Chanhassen Fire Department arrived at the scene five minutes later and found Prince in the elevator. \n \n Emergency responders administered CPR, but were not able to revive the rock star and he was pronounced dead at 10:07 a.m., the report said. \n \n The cause of death was listed as “unknown.” \n \n Prince was 57. \n \n His body was cremated last week and a private service held at Paisley Park. \n \n Olson has said a cause of death probably won’t become public for weeks, after the Sheriff’s Office receives reports from the medical examiner and toxicology results. \n \n The Sheriff’s Office released the incident report at the request of media organizations. It also released, upon request, a list of 47 service calls to Paisley Park over the past five years. Four were for medical reasons. \n \n Three of those medical calls occurred within the last nine months, including the final call. It is unclear whether medical calls on Aug. 9, 2015, and Sept. 6, 2015, involved Prince. \n \n Search warrant sealed \n \n Earlier Thursday, a Carver County judge sealed the search warrant in the death investigation. \n \n The request was made by Metz, who stated that the premature disclosure of the details contained in the warrant may compromise the law enforcement investigation by causing the search or related searches to be unsuccessful. \n \n He added that the release of the information could also create a substantial risk of injury to an innocent person or persons or severely hamper the ongoing investigation. \n \n Search warrants in the investigation of Prince's death at Paisley Park in Chanhassen have been sealed by a Carver County judge at the request of the county attorney. \n \n “Due to Prince’s status of having been an iconic popular music superstar, there is and will be continued intense media scrutiny upon the manner and circumstances of Prince’s death,” Metz said in his argument to seal the warrant and any related documents. \n \n District Judge Eric Braaten ordered that the document remain sealed until the commencement of any criminal proceedings or 180 days from the date of Thursday’s order. \n \n A search warrant is filed and made public no later than 10 days after its execution. The document typically provides a detailed narrative explaining why a law enforcement agency is seeking the warrant and lists the items or data seized during the search. \n \n Staff writers Dan Browning, Emma Nelson and Jeremy Olson contributed to this report."", 'Covered bodies fill a mass grave reported to be in Dariya, Syria, where hundreds of people have been killed. (Shaam News Network / ) \n \n BEIRUT — Bloodied bodies lay strewn in the streets, in basements and even in the cemetery in the besieged Damascus suburb of Dariya, site of what may be the largest mass killing to date in more than 17 months of fighting in Syria, according to opposition and pro-government accounts Sunday. \n \n Video posted Sunday on the Internet purported to show groups of victims in Dariya being buried in a mass grave, a deep trench several yards long. \n \n ""We are finding bodies everywhere. What has happened in Dariya is the most appalling of what has happened in the revolution till now, what has happened in Syria till now,"" said an opposition activist who goes by the name Abu Kinan for security reasons. ""The smell of death is everywhere."" \n \n At least 320 people have been killed in Dariya, a working-class town southwest of the capital, since the military launched an assault on the suburb five days ago, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group opposed to President Bashar Assad. \n \n The killings reported in Dariya contributed to a death toll Saturday that topped 400 throughout Syria, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition umbrella coalition. It appears to be the largest single-day death toll reported to date in the conflict. The group reported more than 200 people killed Sunday. \n \n The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The government has accused the opposition of exaggerating death tolls and inventing massacres in a bid to discredit the armed forces. \n \n According to United Nations figures, at least 17,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Syria since antigovernment protests broke out in March 2011. The opposition puts the death toll at more than 20,000. \n \n Verifying casualty counts in Syria has become more difficult with the departure of United Nations monitors, who had visited some previous massacre sites and provided confirmation of the numbers killed and injured. With the U.N. monitoring mission over, there was little prospect Sunday of any independent investigation into the killings in Dariya. The Syrian government places severe restrictions on media coverage. \n \n Opposition advocates blamed government troops and plainclothes militiamen for the killings. The government blamed ""terrorists,"" its usual term for armed rebels. \n \n The opposition says many victims in Dariya, previously a stronghold of rebels seeking to oust Assad, were executed after pro-government forces entered the town Friday. Others were killed in shelling or shot by snipers, the opposition says. \n \n Opposition activists said many victims were taken prisoner by government forces and executed in basements. In one grisly discovery Saturday, more than 120 bodies were found in one basement, activists said. \n \n According to opposition activists, more than 100 additional bodies were discovered Sunday as government forces withdrew to the town\'s outskirts and residents were able to begin searching more thoroughly. \n \n Most victims were men, but many women and children were also among the dead, the opposition said. \n \n Even the pro-government Syrian TV channel Addounia showed images of residents who had apparently been killed in the midst of seemingly routine daily activities. The station aired footage of a girl killed on a street, a man fallen from his motorcycle, and several bodies at a cemetery. \n \n ""As we have become accustomed, every time we enter an area that has terrorists, they have committed crimes and killings in the name of freedom,"" the Addounia reporter said in her report. \n \n As the camera scanned behind her and got closer on a man shot to death in the driver\'s seat of a blue pickup truck, she added, ""This is their doctrine and this is how they think."" \n \n The Addounia footage from Dariya that aired Sunday showed bloodied bodies on streets, in homes and scattered in a cemetery. Many victims appeared to be women and children. The members of one entire family executed in their home were shot because they didn\'t support the ""terrorists,"" a soldier told the station\'s reporter. \n \n On Sunday, the army returned to some Dariya neighborhoods that had been raided the day before, leading to the deaths of additional residents, said Abu Kinan, the opposition activist. \n \n The government onslaught against Dariya began last week when regime forces began shelling from tanks, helicopters and fighter jets, according to opposition activists. It was the latest in what the opposition calls a methodical attempt to retake and punish rebel-held neighborhoods in Damascus and surrounding suburbs. The assault on Dariya and other suburbs followed an uprising last month that saw intense combat in many parts of the city. \n \n The Syrian military eventually crushed the rebellion in the capital districts. The army then moved its focus to outlying areas such as Dariya. \n \n After fighters with the Free Syrian Army, the rebel umbrella group, withdrew from the town Friday night, soldiers accompanied by shabiha militia members stormed in, opposition groups said. They raided homes and arrested many, taking prisoners to the basements of empty buildings where they were shot execution-style, according to opposition accounts. \n \n Before Dariya, the opposition said, dozens were killed in Moadamyeh al-Sham, another Damascus suburb, and on Sunday military forces were reported to be moving toward the nearby town of Ajdaideh, the opposition said. \n \n The pro-government Addounia channel, reporting on the violence in the Damascus suburbs, aired a surreal sequence in which a reporter, standing in the cemetery where fresh corpses were tossed about, announced the discovery of a woman shot but ""clinging to life."" The camera cut to a woman lying on the ground, her head resting on a shattered stone grave marker, her hands bloody from her wound. \n \n ""I was heading to Damascus with my husband and children and suddenly I found myself like this,"" explained the wounded woman, who said that her husband worked for state security and that she didn\'t know what had happened to him or her three children. \n \n ""Who hit you, ma\'am? Tell us,"" the reporter said. \n \n ""I don\'t know,"" she said. ""I don\'t remember anything, I don\'t remember, except that I was shot."" \n \n Once the brief interview was over, army soldiers arrived and took the wounded woman away on a stretcher. \n \n A Times staff writer in Beirut and special correspondent Rima Marrouch in Antakya, Turkey, contributed to this report.']",3,"– Investigators suspect an overdose of prescription drugs caused Prince's death last week and they want to find out exactly where he got them, according to a source close to the investigation. The probe is looking at whether a doctor was on Prince's plane when he made an emergency landing in Illinois the week before his death, and whether he overdosed on the plane, a law enforcement official tells the AP, which notes that the development is worryingly reminiscent of Michael Jackson's death. The source confirmed reports that the opiate painkiller Percocet is believed to have been involved. Documents released on Thursday signal that the investigation is now a criminal probe and charges are a possibility, the Star Tribune reports. The documents released by the Carver County, Minn., sheriff's office Thursday include a request to seal the results of a search conducted at Prince's Paisley Park the day he died, Reuters reports. A judge granted the request, which was made on the grounds that ""intense media scrutiny"" could hamper the investigation or risk injury to innocent people. Carver County Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud declined to comment on reports of drugs found at Prince's home. He tells the AP that contrary to media reports, investigators have not asked the DEA to get involved. ""We might contact them to help us, but that hasn't happened,"" he says.

Researchers reviewed two decades of CDC data, from 1993 to 2012. Though they write in JAMA Pediatrics that ""suicide is a leading cause of death among school-aged children younger than 12 years,"" they found that suicides among those ages 5 to 11 are very rare, reports the AP: There were 657 during the period studied, or one roughly every week-and-a-half (per the CDC, the daily average for all ages is 105 suicides). But while the suicide rate remained stable during that time, ""that stability obscured racial differences,"" observes Psych Central. The suicide rate decreased in white children, but increased significantly in black children, from from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million between the study's first five years and its last five. (In white children, the shift was from 1.14 to 0.77.) That shot suicide up from No. 14 on the list of causes of death among black kids of this age to No. 9; it's No. 11 for white kids. The researchers noted that 84% of those who committed suicide were boys and just 16% girls, and the rate worsens when viewed through a gender lens as well. For black boys, the rate climbed to 3.47 per million. The findings represent a big shift, per lead author Jeffrey Bridge. ""Historically, the suicide rate among US black individuals has been lower than that of white individuals across age groups,"" reads the study. ""To our knowledge, this is the first national study to observe higher suicide rates among US black individuals compared with white individuals."" Hanging and suffocation were the main methods for young children. Bridge advises parents to look for warning signs like prolonged unhappiness and withdrawing from favorite activities.

Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to call Pittsfield Police Officer Brenna Dorr at 413-448-9700, ext 384. \n \n PITTSFIELD — Two men are facing charges for allegedly participating in a citywide prostitution ring involving multiple women — one of whom may have been as young as 15 — who were allegedly plied with drugs and threats. \n \n \n \n Joseph E. Van Wert, 65, of Becket, and Randy W. Lambach, 45, of Pittsfield, are being held on charges including human trafficking pending dangerousness hearing Nov. 29 to determine if bail should be set and in what amount. \n \n \n \n The investigation began in the spring of 2017 after police began receiving calls and complaints regarding apparent increases in prostitution throughout the city. \n \n \n \n Most of the activity seemed to be centered around the areas of First, Adam, North, Linden and Wahconah streets, police said. Many of the women had been recruited by a white male named ""Randy."" \n \n \n \n Randy would seek out women with a drug addiction, photograph them and post advertisements online, seeking clients for sexual services, police were told. \n \n \n \n While conducting patrols around First and Second streets, police interviewed multiple women, many of whom admitted to being prostitutes, but declined to identify who ""tricked them out."" \n \n \n \n One told police she didn\'t ""street-walk,"" but instead got her ""dates"" through ads on backpage.com. \n \n \n \n Police also began receiving reports of suspected prostitution from a North Street senior living facility, where Randy had driven at least five women to and from Van Wert\'s third-floor apartment. \n \n \n \n Police were provided the plate number of the blue station wagon used to shuttle the women and identified Lambach as its owner. And witnesses identified Lambach via photographs as the man they knew as Randy. \n \n \n \n One woman told police she was prostituted by Lambach for about a year and had sex with him for money or to pay off a debt on multiple occasions. Lambach photographed her and placed advertisements on backpage.com. \n \n \n \n Men would contact Lambach via cellphone and a date, time, location and fee would be agreed upon. Rates were typically $80 for 30 minutes or between $160 and $200 for an hour. \n \n \n \n Lambach would then contact the woman and drive her to the appointment, police said. He would sometimes wait outside or watch from a closet or doorway. \n \n \n \n He would collect the money and keep anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of it. Sometimes he would keep all of the money and pay the woman with a few bags of heroin or some crack cocaine instead. \n \n \n \n One of the women told police Lambach would drive her to appointments outside of Pittsfield, and on at least one occasion, outside of the state. \n \n \n \n He allegedly recruited and transported about 10 other women in a similar manner and provided narcotics to those that used drugs to get them high before having sex. \n \n \n \n Lambach allegedly threatened to turn the women in if they stopped working for him, and warned them the police would not believe them because they were, ""drug addicts and whores."" Police were told some of the women Lambach had recruited used to be his foster children. \n \n \n \n He would host meetings between women and customers at Van Wert\'s apartment. \n \n \n \n Van Wert allegedly paid for sex with the women and was paid by Lambach in cash and drugs for use of his apartment. \n \n \n \n Another witness told police that Lambach approached her in August, telling her he ran a prostitution ring and showed her several photographs of women he said worked for him. \n \n \n \n That witness said it appeared several of the women in those photos were very young and estimated the age of one at about 15. \n \n \n \n Lambach allegedly said he also drives women to Springfield, where they prostitute themselves from a strip club. \n \n \n \n Another witness told police Lambach may have been involved in prostitution and trafficking for about 10 years. \n \n \n \n Other witnesses told police Lambach would threaten the women if he thought they were giving information to the police. \n \n \n \n By mid-November, police felt they had enough probable cause to arrest the men. \n \n \n \n Lambach was picked up without incident about 4 p.m. Nov. 14. Van Wert was arrested at his apartment shortly thereafter. \n \n \n \n Lambach has pleaded not guilty in Central Berkshire District Court to four counts of human trafficking. Van Wert has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit human trafficking, deriving support from prostitution, maintaining a house of prostitution and sexual conduct for a fee. \n \n \n \n The investigation remains ongoing and additional charges may be coming. \n \n The Pittsfield Police Department detective bureau, anti-crime unit, drug unit as well as members of the state police detective unit assigned to the District Attorney\'s Office, are assisting with this investigation.

126,"[""(Reuters) - U.S. judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n \n However, lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on Sunday to follow the judges’ rulings. \n \n Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state, each home to international airports, issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on Saturday night by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York’s Brooklyn borough. \n \n Donnelly had ruled in a lawsuit by two men from Iraq being held at John F. Kennedy International Airport. \n \n While none of the rulings struck down Friday’s executive order by the new Republican president, the growing number of them could complicate the administration’s effort to enforce it. \n \n The rulings add to questions about the constitutionality of the order, said Andrew Pincus, a Mayer Brown partner representing two Yemeni men who were denied U.S. entry from an overseas flight despite being legal permanent residents. \n \n “People have gone through processes to obtain legal permanent resident status, or visas,” Pincus said. “There are serious questions about whether those rights, which were created by statute, can be unilaterally taken away without process.” \n \n Trump’s order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. \n \n He said these actions were needed “to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” \n \n The order sparked a global backlash, including from U.S. allies that view the actions as discriminatory and divisive. \n \n Attorneys general from California, New York, 13 other states and Washington, D.C., meanwhile, in a statement condemned and pledged to fight what they called Trump’s “dangerous” and “unconstitutional” order. \n \n The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Sunday said it “will comply with judicial orders,” while enforcing Trump’s order in a manner that ensures those entering the United States “do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.” \n \n SAFE, NOT SORRY \n \n Striking that balance has caused confusion, according to lawyers who worked overnight and on Sunday to help travelers at JFK Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia, and elsewhere. \n \n Activists gather at the US Capitol to protest President Donald Trump's executive actions on immigration in Washington January 29, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \n \n Immigration lawyer Sharifa Abbasi said some Border Patrol agents at Dulles refused to let lawyers talk with detainees, even after being shown an order from U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema requiring such access. \n \n Abbasi said the agents instead told the lawyers to call their agency’s office, where no one was answering. \n \n “There is really no method to this madness,” Becca Heller, director of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project organization, told reporters on a conference call. \n \n Supporters of Trump’s order said authorities acted properly in swiftly taking steps to enforce it. \n \n “It is better (to) be safe than sorry,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. \n \n Lawsuits on behalf of more than 100 individual travelers have been filed nationwide, activists and lawyers estimated. \n \n Some have come from large corporate firms including Mayer Brown, Kirkland & Ellis, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. \n \n CURBS ON TRUMP’S ORDER \n \n In Boston, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on Sunday temporarily blocked the removal of two Iranians who have taught at the University of Massachusetts, and had been detained at the city’s Logan International Airport. \n \n Burroughs’ ruling appeared to go further than Donnelly’s by barring the detention, as well as the removal, of approved refugees, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents entering from the seven countries. Donnelly’s order forbade only removal. \n \n Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, in a statement called Burroughs’ ruling “a huge victory for justice” in the face of what he called Trump’s “unconstitutional ban on Muslims.” \n \n The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion. Trump’s order sought to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, which the president said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. \n \n Burroughs’ ruling also prompted some Trump critics to urge holders of green cards, which allow foreign nationals to live and work permanently in the United States, to fly into Boston, to lessen the risk of detainment. \n \n White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said several times on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump’s order does not affect green card holders “moving forward” or “going forward.” \n \n Slideshow (7 Images) \n \n In a ruling on Sunday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles directed the return to the United States of Ali Khoshbakhti Vayeghan, who authorities had sent back to his native Iran following Trump’s order. \n \n The ruling from Brinkema, in Alexandria, Virginia, barred the Homeland Security agency from removing an estimated 50 to 60 legal permanent residents who had been detained at Dulles. \n \n In Seattle, U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly barred the government from removing two people, who were not named in court papers. He scheduled a Feb. 3 hearing on whether to lift that stay."", 'Protesters rally against President Trump\'s refugee ban at Miami International Airport on Sunday, Jan. 29, 2017.b President Donald Trump’s immigration order sowed more confusion and outrage across the...

Gonzalez is from Puerto Rico and works in Miami. \n \n Trump\'s order placed a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.

Reuters reports that judges in three additional states—Massachusetts, Virginia, and Washington state—have since followed suit. Reuters points out that these legal moves are curbs that do not eradicate President Trump's executive order that severely limits immigration, but observes ""the growing number ... could complicate the administration's effort to enforce it."" The former is exactly what an unnamed senior White House official pointed out, reportedly telling NBC's Kelly O'Donnell such rulings do ""not undercut the President's executive order."" The official continues, ""All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited. ... The order remains in place."" But the pressure shows no sign of easing: The AP reports that the attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia will issue a joint statement branding Trump's ban as unconstitutional and at odds with ""a bedrock principle"" of the US: religious liberty. The states: Washington, California, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Virginia, Oregon, Connecticut, Vermont, Illinois, New Mexico, Iowa, Maine, and Maryland. What Trump had to say Sunday morning on Twitter: ""Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!"""

128,"[""Story highlights George W. Bush and Michelle Obama have been seen becoming increasingly chummy \n \n On Saturday , Obama reached over and grabbed Bush into a hug \n \n (CNN) Saturday's dedication of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture brought together the president who signed into law the funding for the museum and the president who was in office during its completion. \n \n But the gathering of the 43rd and 44th first couples also saw the reuniting of two unlikely friends. \n \n Over the past eight years, former President George W. Bush and First Lady Michelle Obama have been seen becoming increasingly chummy. At public events, the two can often be found sitting next to each other, sharing a laugh or lending a hand to hold. \n \n Saturday's ceremony was no exception. During the event, Obama reached over and grabbed Bush into a hug as their spouses clapped and looked on. \n \n Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images \n \n Bush asked his successor for a little help taking a selfie. \n \n Here's the moment President Bush asked President Obama for a little help taking a selfie https://t.co/htnaP3apwd https://t.co/lAO972CR3A — CNN (@CNN) September 24, 2016 \n \n Read More"", 'A striking image from this weekend offers some symbolic hope for Americans troubled by the country’s stark division along ethnic, political, economic, and gender lines. \n \n At the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture yesterday, photographers including Pulitzer-winner David Hume Kennerly captured a warm embrace between first lady Michelle Obama and former president George W. Bush, who first signed the bill to build the museum in 2003. \n \n The photo clearly resonates with a country grappling with its own history of racism and slavery, one that quite literally built the White House we know today. And as the US anticipates a combative first presidential debate tomorrow (Sep. 26), it’s all the more striking to see leaders reaching across the proverbial aisle in a moment of genuine warmth.', 'MALONE – One desperate man continued to elude 1,200 police as they searched 22 square miles of rugged, mountainous land in the northern Adirondacks on Saturday. As the search for cop killer David P. Sweat stretched into its 22nd day, investigators have begun to piece together the last days of his fellow escapee, Richard W. Matt. He was probably miserable. When he was gunned down Friday afternoon, Matt, the two-time murderer who grew up in the City of Tonawanda, was sick and drunk. It also looked like he had been outdoors for a long time, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation into the prison escape. The indication that he was sick came Wednesday night, as an army of federal, state and local law enforcement officers went door to door at homes and camps around Owls Head and Malone. A burglary of a cabin on Route 41 was reported. That is where police found soiled underwear, the source told The Buffalo News, and a DNA test showed they belonged to Matt. The underwear also told investigators that Matt was ill, possibly from having consumed spoiled food or bad water. And police believe Matt was intoxicated when he was killed. That clue came after authorities were alerted to another cabin burglary Friday morning, this time a camp at the base of Humbug Mountain just off Route 30, the main north-south artery through the area. Malone Town Supervisor Howard F. Maneely said Saturday that his nephew, Robert Willett, owns the camp. “He went in there Wednesday to check on things and it was all OK,” Maneely said. But his nephew’s son discovered a far different situation when he returned Friday morning. “The camp had been broken into and there were booze bottles on the table,” the supervisor said. “That’s when he got hold of the authorities.” There was a half-empty bottle of gin and other bottles on the table, a law enforcement source said. Maneely described the camp as typical of those in the area, used mostly during the fall deer season and for summertime family picnics. It features a kitchen, lounge area and three small bedrooms. \n \n Finding Matt Several hours later, a man who was hauling a camper on a trailer through Route 30 reported that someone had fired a shot at his camper while he was driving. At first, he thought it was a flat tire. He got out and checked it, found nothing, and drove another eight miles before finding the bullet hole. State police went to investigate and traced the path back eight miles, where they found another camp that had been broken into. Inside, they smelled gunpowder. A tactical team from U.S. Customs and Border Protection was helicoptered in and as they searched, they found Matt. He had a 20-gauge shotgun at his side, officials said. From his clothes and appearance, it looked like he had not bathed in a long time and had spent a great deal of time in the outdoors, a law enforcement source told The News. The tactical team challenged Matt, who did not give up his weapon. He did not say anything before he was shot, the source said. He did not fire his weapon. A strong odor of alcohol emanated from Matt’s body, the law enforcement source said. The News last week reported that as a young man, Matt had twice tried to commit suicide. And the special prosecutor who won the murder conviction against Matt said that he had been told in 2008 that, if Matt ever escaped, he would not be taken alive, according to the Associated Press. But a law enforcement source said it did not appear that Matt was committing “suicide by cop” when he was shot. Matt’s body was sent to Albany Medical Center on Saturday and was scheduled for an autopsy. His breakout from Clinton Correctional Facility with Sweat and the massive manhunt captivated the nation and led to wild speculation about where they could be hiding out. But in the end, Matt died just 40 miles from the prison. He was 49. His birthday was Thursday. \n \n Search for Sweat But Matt’s death brought investigators no closer to finding his accomplice. Authorities thought Friday night that they had Sweat surrounded. Investigators have been operating under the assumption that Sweat was near Matt when he was killed about 4 p.m. Friday. But the last time they had any evidence that Sweat was still in the area came from DNA samples collected from a seasonal hunting camp in Owls Head that had been discovered burglarized June 20, the first of four cabins where police believe the two had taken shelter. That cabin is located about eight miles east of where Matt was shot. The News incorrectly reported Saturday that DNA from Sweat had been found Wednesday in the cabin on Route 41 where the underwear was found. And there have been no confirmed sightings of Sweat. So it is possible the two parted ways days – possibly even a week – ago. Saturday night, investigators were waiting for results on DNA tests on items recovered from the cabin where the gunpowder was smelled to determine whether Sweat had been there. In the meantime, the armies of federal, state and local law enforcement officers weren’t letting up on the search around Titus Lake, even with heavy downpours of rain forecast for Saturday night and all day Sunday. Asked how long the search would continue, State Police spokesman Beau Duffy answered Saturday: “Until we catch him.” “For the foreseeable future, we will either find him in that area or decide he’s not there,” Duffy said, adding that there is no contemplation of leaving the Malone-area search now. He also said morale remains high among the searchers. “I hear them all the time say they won’t stop until they find him,” he said. “That’s their attitude.”', 'TATAOUINE, Tunisia — A century ago, fleeing Italian colonizers, the inhabitants of Libya ’s remote western mountains descended upon this wind-whipped Tunisian outpost, many to stay permanently. \n \n With those desert plateaus once again under siege, this time by the armies of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, about 30,000 Libyans have repeated their ancestors’ flight. Astonishingly, to aid workers, hundreds upon hundreds of Tunisians, some of them the descendants of those earlier refugees, have opened their homes to these Libyan families since early April, when Colonel Qaddafi’s forces went on the attack. \n \n There are no sprawling refugee camps at the border, just two modest clusters of tents housing around 2,500 people. The vast majority of the newcomers are now living with Tunisian families here and in neighboring villages, an area that in normal times counts just 150,000 residents. \n \n “It’s the first time I’ve seen such an impressive response,” said Firas Kayal, a spokesman in Tunisia for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That generosity is all the more remarkable, he added, given the challenges Tunisia faces in the wake of its own revolution — which in January ended 23 years of kleptocratic rule by President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali — and previous waves of Libyan refugees this year in the north. \n \n Even some of the refugees seem baffled by it. \n \n “Would you give your house to someone you didn’t know, from another country?” asked Maren Abouzakhar, 22, who fled the besieged Libyan city of Yafran early this month. She spoke in the airy drawing room of the house she and 10 relatives now shared with a local family; the owner had moved himself, his wife and their three children into the unfinished ground floor, leaving the comfortable, perfumed second story for their guests. \n \n “We don’t even know how to thank them for something like this,” Ms. Abouzakhar said. \n \n Abdallah Awaye, 35, a thin, sun-darkened man and the owner of the house, described his gesture as a matter of obligation and pride. “This is how it is, these are our customs,” he said. “If there is something to eat, we will eat it together. If there is nothing to eat, we will have nothing together.” \n \n Most of the refugees arrived at the border with little more than the clothes on their backs and fears for the sons they left behind to fight the Qaddafi militias, and were rapidly taken in by local residents whose compassion and good cheer have drawn the admiration of Libyans and international aid workers alike. \n \n Mr. Kayal also praised the generosity of the Tunisian government, which has kept the country’s borders open from the start of the Libyan conflict. As many 276,000 people — most of them foreign workers — have fled Libya for Tunisia, according to United Nations estimates. \n \n Asked about their willingness to provide shelter to strangers, residents of Tataouine like to cite an apt local proverb: Travelers cry upon arriving in this desolate place, but leave with tears in their eyes. \n \n Despite the abundance of good intentions, though, the city and surrounding areas are feeling the strain of so many refugees. The afterglow of January’s jubilant revolution has largely given way to old frustrations, with people complaining of a stagnant economy, inadequate infrastructure and widespread unemployment. \n \n The police, the lackeys of the deposed government, are largely absent from the streets, having gone into hiding after the revolution. And many worry that the country’s transitional government has failed to break with what they call decades of neglect for the arid Tunisian south. \n \n “Generosity and fraternity have been taking precedence over the problems,” said Ali Mourou, the mayor of Tataouine. \n \n Nevertheless, he said, in response to appeals from the city, truckloads of aid have flowed in from as far as Tunis, the capital, 300 miles to the north. \n \n Three local coordinating centers have been opened, placing Libyan families in homes and distributing donated couscous, macaroni, milk and tomatoes, as well as mattresses and blankets. Libyan children have been placed in local schools, and doctors and nurses have opened a clinic offering free medical care. \n \n “We’ve taken the thing as a human obligation, a religious obligation, an obligation of fraternity,” Mr. Mourou said, and the Libyans have been “truly appreciative.” \n \n He added, “They ought to be.” \n \n He worries, though.']",4,"– A reunion of ""two unlikely friends"" happened Saturday during the dedication of DC's National Museum of African American History and Culture, per CNN—and the photo of Michelle Obama's embrace of George W. Bush has now become a ""powerful image … for the ages,"" notes Quartz. CNN notes that the two have become ""increasingly chummy"" throughout President Obama's tenure, often sitting next to each other at events and even holding hands at a July memorial service for the slain Dallas police officers. Reaction to the photo taken by former White House photographer David Hume Kennerly has made its way onto social media, per Mediaite, with one commenter noting: ""This is what America is! we disagree but we don't hate!"" Of course, others had to show off their Photoshop skills and make a meme out of the photo, which has now produced variations that include Obama hugging soon-to-be-single Brad Pitt, Donald Trump, and an actual bush; the Huffington Post has compiled its favorites."
129,"['Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images There is no question that Americans are frustrated with their elected officials, but the latest Gallup poll shows that frustration has reached a fever pitch, plummeting Congress to its lowest approval rating in history. Just 10 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, fewer than at any previous point in Gallup\'s nearly 40 years of polling. With an approval rating that low, it is hard to find anything that is actually less popular than Congress.

ABC News takes a look at some very unpopular things that still manage to rank above Congress: According to an August poll, Paris Hilton is America's least-favorite celeb. But her 60% disapproval rating is still better than Congress's 86% disapproval rating. Socialism is about three times as popular as Congress: About 33% of Americans view the system positively, according to a January poll. About half of Americans polled in November said waterboarding should be permitted as an interrogation technique—meaning more support the technique than support Congress.

Network president Channing Dungey confirmed the plans for the new episodes while on a conference call with reporters ahead of ABC\'s big presentation during 2017 Upfronts week in New York City. \n \n ""We\'re rebooting Roseanne,"" she said. ""It is planned for the midseason. We\'re still at the early stages."" Per the network\'s press release, the eight-episode revival will find the Connors continuing to deal with ""the economic challenges of living pay check to pay check in 2018.""', 'The reboot, which will feature returning stars Roseanne Barr and John Goodman among others, is set to air midseason. \n \n It\'s official: Roseanne is returning to ABC. \n \n The network has handed out an eight-episode straight-to-series order for a revival of the wildly popular family sitcom headlined by comedian Roseanne Barr. The reboot will debut sometime midseason on the network. \n \n ""We\'re rebooting Roseanne,"" ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said Tuesday during pre-upfronts call with reporters. The series will return midseason, with a formal date to be announced later. \n \n Original castmembers Roseanne Barr, John Goodman (despite the fact that his character Dan died of a heart attack during the final season), Sara Gilbert (Darlene), Laurie Metcalf (Jackie), Michael Fishman (D.J.) and Lecy Goranson (Becky) are all set to return. Sarah Chalke, who played the role of Becky after Goranson, will also return, but in a different role. \n \n “The Conners’ joys and struggles are as relevant — and hilarious — today as they were then, and there’s really no one better to comment on our modern America than Roseanne,” Dungey said in a statement. \n \n The pickup comes almost 20 years after the Emmy-winning multicam went off the air. The revival will again be a multicamera comedy. \n \n The revival sparked interest from several potential buyers including Netflix, which has revived Full House, Arrested Development and Gilmore Girls. The Roseanne revival was spearheaded by Gilbert, who currently hosts and exec produces the CBS daytime show The Talk. \n \n Gilbert joins original exec producers Barr, Tom Werner and Bruce Helford. Whitney Cummings and Tony Hernandez also exec produce. Like the original series, independent studio Carsey-Werner Television will produce. \n \n Roseanne centered on the working-class Conner family in Illinois and ran on ABC from 1988-97. At its peak, Roseanne ranked as the top series on television during the 1989-90 season and drew nearly 17 million viewers for its final episode. The series has continued to air in reruns on TV Land, CMT and Logo. \n \n The pickup comes as networks, including ABC, have worked hard to better appeal to working-class middle America in the wake of Donald Trump\'s stunning defeat over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. ""[The election] made the ground shake underneath media,"" TLC president Nancy Daniels told THR in December, ""and now everybody is taking a hard look: Are we telling the right stories? Are we reaching the right people?"" \n \n Roseanne is just the latest in a long line of revivals that includes NBC\'s Will & Grace, as well as 24, Prison Break and The X-Files — which will return with another 10 episodes in 2018 — on Fox. ABC\'s cult beloved mystery Twin Peaks is also getting the revival treatment, albeit on Showtime. \n \n Roseanne will be one of two revivals on the Disney-owned broadcaster. The network beat out NBC and Fox to resurrect American Idol only a year after Fox opted to cancel the singing competition. On the unscripted, ABC has also found success with revivals of game shows like Match Game and $100,000 Pyramid. \n \n Roseanne\'s straight-to-series pickup will be ABC\'s lone multicamera comedy on its 2017-18 schedule. ABC recently canceled Last Man Standing and Dr. Ken — its only multicamera shows. The Disney-owned network will start the fall 2017-18 season without a single multicamera comedy on its schedule as pilot Household Name, starring Carol Burnett, is being redeveloped. The format, however, remains popular on CBS, which is home to Big Bang Theory, Mom, Kevin Can Wait, Superior Donuts and Man With a Plan. (Both Big Bang and Mom are executive produced by former Roseanne writer Chuck Lorre.) \n \n In addition to the Will & Grace revival, launching in the fall, NBC has The Carmichael Show and Marlon, both of which are being held for summer. Fox has been out of the multicam business for a few seasons. \n \n Here\'s the full original cast reunited at ABC\'s upfront:']",2,"– Roseanne's return to TV has been confirmed, 20 years to the week after the beloved sitcom's final episode aired.

The network says the reboot will feature Roseanne's original cast, including Roseanne Barr, Sara Gilbert, and John Goodman, despite the fact that Goodman's character, dad Dan Conner, died during the show's final season. Barr and Gilbert will be among the executive producers of the show, which won 17 Emmys during its nine-season run.

131,"['Since film magnate Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual harassment and assault in October, scores of women have come forward as part of the #MeToo movement to say that they, too, have been victims of sexual misconduct. As more and more people come forward with allegations against powerful people and some of those powerful people lose their jobs, some have called the moment in history a tipping point ; others have called it a reckoning . And while many are being taken to task for their alleged misconduct and there is potential for a cultural shift in the way we view sexual harassment and assault, this isn\'t the first time women have publicly spoken out against alleged harassers. In 1991, law professor Anita Hill sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Senator Joe Biden , and detailed the alleged harassment she experienced from her boss, Clarence Thomas, who was just about to be confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice. Throughout Hill\'s testimony, she weathered attacks on her character and her trustworthiness from those on the Senate panel, and many have blamed Biden for allowing those attacks and failing to do more. Nearly three decades after her testimony, and after Thomas was seated on the court, Biden wants Anita Hill to know that he\'s sorry. \n \n In an interview with Teen Vogue \'s editor in chief, Elaine Welteroth, Biden said there are a few things he would do differently if he could go back and redo those Anita Hill hearings. \n \n ""I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas. And I insisted the next election — I campaigned for two women Senators on the condition that if they won they would come on the Judiciary Committee, so there would never be again all men making a judgment on this,"" Biden said. ""And my one regret is that I wasn’t able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends. I mean, they really went after her. As much as I tried to intervene, I did not have the power to gavel them out of order. I tried to be like a judge and only allow a question that would be relevant to ask."" \n \n But ultimately, Biden said he wasn\'t able to do enough. \n \n ""I wasn’t able to convince three women we’d subpoenaed to cooperate with testimony. At the last minute, they changed their mind and said they wouldn’t do it. I had them sign an affidavit saying, ‘I want you to come, and you’re saying, “No, I will not come.“‘ In retrospect, some, including Anita, think I should have subpoenaed them no matter what,"" he said. ""The reason I didn’t: I was worried they would come and not corroborate what she said and make — I mean, Clarence Thomas won by only two votes. And we still thought we had a chance at beating him."" \n \n ""I wish I had been able to do more for Anita Hill,"" he said. ""I owe her an apology."" \n \n Many, including Hill, have criticized Biden for allowing some of the remarks those on the Committee made, including insinuations that Thomas allegedly talking about women\'s breast sizes was ""not too bad,"" according to The Washington Post. Some even said Biden\'s tone with Hill bordered on disbelief of her accusations. According to Politico , the hearing was ""seen as Biden\'s subjecting an African-American woman to public humiliation and abuse."" In fact, Biden has offered public apologies to Hill before , but she has said it wasn\'t enough. \n \n ""I still don’t think it takes ownership of his role in what happened,"" Hill said in a recent interview with The Washington Post . ""And he also doesn’t understand that it wasn’t just that I felt it was not fair. It was that women were looking to the Senate Judiciary Committee and his leadership to really open the way to have these kinds of hearings. They should have been using best practices to show leadership on this issue on behalf of women’s equality. And they did just the opposite."" \n \n ""You cannot just bring people forward into a process where you know they’re not going to be treated fairly,"" she continued. ""That’s not being heard."" \n \n In the Post interview, Hill said truly being heard is what women are grappling with today during the #MeToo movement. Biden told Teen Vogue something similar. \n \n ""We’re now at a point here where we have a chance to change the culture,"" he said. Biden was clear that harassment is a part of our culture, deeply ingrained and even normalized to a point where we sometimes don\'t even notice it. Through his work on college campuses and involving men in the effort to prevent sexual violence through his It\'s on Us campaign, Biden said he hopes he\'s able to make some headway toward the sea change that\'s clearly coming. \n \n ""I’ve gotten asked by press a lot of the last 23 years, how will I know when I’ve succeeded. We will have succeeded when not a single woman who is abused ever, ever, ever asks herself, What did I do?"" he said. ""We’ve got to change it. We’ve got to change the culture."" \n \n Related: The Surprising Way Experts Are Successfully Combating Sexual Assaults on College Campuses', 'Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n A renegade pastor and his tiny flock set fire to a Koran on a street corner, and made sure to capture it on film. And they were ignored. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That stunt took place in 2008, involving members of the Westboro Baptist Church from Topeka, Kan., an almost universally condemned group of fundamentalists who also protest at military funerals. \n \n But plans for a similar stunt by another fringe pastor, Terry Jones, have garnered worldwide news media attention this summer, attention that peaked Thursday when he announced he was canceling — and later, that he had only “suspended” — what he had dubbed International Burn a Koran Day. It had been scheduled for Saturday, the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \n \n Unlike the Koran-burning by Westboro Baptist, Mr. Jones’s planned event in Gainesville, Fla., coincided with the controversy over the proposed building of a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan near ground zero and a simmering summerlong debate about the freedoms of speech and religion. \n \n Mr. Jones was able to put himself at the center of those issues by using the news lull of summer and the demands of a 24-hour news cycle to promote his anti-Islam cause. He said he consented to more than 150 interview requests in July and August, each time expressing his extremist views about Islam and Sharia law. \n \n By the middle of this week, the planned Koran burning was the lead story on some network newscasts, and topic No. 1 on cable news — an extraordinary amount of attention for a marginal figure with a very small following. On Thursday, President Obama condemned Mr. Jones’s plan, and his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said that there were “more people at his press conferences than listen to his sermons,” in a bit of media criticism. \n \n Mr. Jones’s plan, announced in July, slowly gained attention in August, particularly overseas. It became a top story in the United States this week after protests against Mr. Jones in Afghanistan and after the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, warned that the Koran burning could endanger troops. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “Before there were riots and heads of states talking about him, it could have been a couple of paragraphs in a story about Sept. 11 commemorations,” Kathleen Carroll, the executive editor of The Associated Press, said Thursday. “It’s beyond that now.” \n \n In some ways, this week’s events were the culmination of a year’s worth of hateful statements and stunts by Mr. Jones and the few dozen members of his church. \n \n Mr. Jones started to make noise in Gainesville in the summer of 2009, when he posted a sign outside his church that read “Islam is of the devil.” The Gainesville Sun (which is owned by The New York Times Company) wrote about the sign, under the headline “Anti-Islam church sign stirs up community outrage.” \n \n He told The Sun that the sign would not be his last. \n \n The newspaper soon published an investigation into what it called the church’s “financial abuses,” which included a profit-making eBay furniture sales business operating on the church’s property. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The congregation’s protests continued last fall, when some children from the church wore anti-Islam shirts to school, prompting another article by The Sun, which was picked up by The Associated Press and republished by outlets like USA Today and Al Arabiya, an Arabic language news network. \n \n People with the same anti-Islam shirts sometimes roamed the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, said Fiona Mc Laughlin, a professor at the university, prompting a counterprotest with T-shirts that read, “Ignorance is of the devil.” \n \n The church “never really rested after that first billboard,” said Jacki Levine, the managing editor of The Sun. She said the newspaper’s staff members had repeatedly discussed how to be “responsible” in its coverage — “We walked as carefully as we could walk.” \n \n Islam was not Mr. Jones’s only target. Church members also held protests against Craig Lowe, an openly gay man who was elected mayor of Gainesville in April. \n \n Mr. Jones’s announcement about the Koran burning gained only a little attention at first, with a single short article published by Religion News Service on July 21. That article was subsequently mentioned by Yahoo and other Web sites, and by the end of the July Mr. Jones had been booked on CNN, where the host Rick Sanchez called his plan “crazy” but added, “At least he has got the guts to come on this show and face off.” \n \n Alarmed by negative mentions about Gainesville in overseas news outlets, Mr. Lowe released a statement Aug. 3 labeling Mr. Jones’s church a “tiny fringe group and an embarrassment to our community.” \n \n News executives said the proposed burning took on a greater significance after the protests in Afghanistan and in other Muslim countries. In Kabul last Sunday, up to 500 people attended a protest at which Mr. Jones was burned in effigy, according to The A.P. \n \n That, too, is when Ms. Mc Laughlin took notice. With 11 other professors, she wrote a column for The Sun condemning the plan titled “The world is watching.” \n \n “We just saw everything escalating,” she said Thursday, citing the “sum effect” of all the coverage and the ensuing reactions. (The New York Times wrote a substantial article about Mr. Jones on August 26.) \n \n On Thursday, before Mr. Jones suspended his plans, The A.P. determined that it would not distribute pictures of Korans being burned, restating a policy not to cover events that are “gratuitously manufactured to provoke and offend.” \n \n “There are lots of other similarly offensive images that we choose not to run all the time,” Ms. Carroll said. “Most people don’t know that because, of course, we don’t run them.” \n \n Before the suspension, CNN and Fox News Channel said they would not show any images of a Koran being burned. \n \n Bill Keller, the executive editor of The New York Times, said in an e-mail message that the newspaper had “no policy against publishing things that might offend someone — lots of people are offended by lots of things — but we try to refrain from giving widespread offense unless there is some offsetting journalistic purpose.” \n \n “A picture of a burning book contributes nothing substantial to a story about book-burning, so the offense seems entirely gratuitous,” Mr. Keller continued. “The freedom to publish includes the freedom not to publish.” \n \n The episode has given rise to at least a little soul-searching within news organizations. Chris Cuomo, an ABC News anchor, wrote Thursday afternoon on Twitter, “I am in the media, but think media gave life to this Florida burning ... and that was reckless.”']",2,"– When law professor Anita Hill faced the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 to testify about the sexual harassment she said she endured from then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, she also faced down attacks on her character and credibility—and many (including Hill herself) still blame Joe Biden, the senator who led the panel, for allowing that to happen. Now he tells Teen Vogue he's sorry for his role. ""I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas,"" he says. ""And my one regret is that I wasn't able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends. I mean, they really went after her."" He says he felt his hands were tied as he tried to simply play ""judge"" in the proceedings, but he wonders if he could've done more, including subpoenaing witnesses who may have backed Hill up.

132,"['It reads like a bad spy thriller. Between November 2016 and October 2017, a strange illness afflicted 24 diplomatic staff members working at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba. Employees reported symptoms such as headaches, confusion, hearing loss. They talked about hearing strange sounds, triggering speculation the Cubans were employing a new acoustic weapon to harass embassy employees. Other scientists dismissed the idea of a sonic weapon as impractical. \n \n On September 1 science reporter William Broad jumped into this morass with a long article in The New York Times. His theory: the Cubans were employing a microwave weapon against U.S. embassy employees, causing sonic delusions and “very real brain damage”. He based his theory on the microwave auditory effect, in which pulses of microwave energy of the sort emitted by radar elicits auditory sensations in exposed individuals. \n \n As the scientist who first proposed the now-accepted explanation of the effect in my 1974 Science article, I find the theory wildly implausible. To elicit auditory sensations, individuals must be exposed to intense but brief (microsecond) pulses of microwave energy. The pulses are sufficient to heat brain tissue by a few microdegrees in a few microseconds, and the resulting thermal expansion launches an acoustic wave in the brain that the subject perceives as sound. The acoustic pressures are many orders of magnitude too weak to cause tissue damage. They elicit audible sensations only because of the exquisite sensitivity of the human auditory system, and represent a near-threshold hearing phenomenon. To actually damage the brain, the microwaves would have to be so intense they would actually burn the subject, which has never happened in any of these incidents. \n \n To induce such an effect, one could cobble together a device from a military radar set or a commercial microwave generator, such as the one I used in my original experiments, and then direct a beam at a distant target. But the difficulty of aiming the beam at a person’s head some distance away would be daunting. You would have to know exactly where the victim’s head is located. You could use a much higher power radar such as that used for airport traffic control and spray the beam over a wide area, but the equipment then would be very large and cumbersome. Microwave antennas could also be embedded within the embassy walls, along with some kind of aiming device, but they would be easy to detect. \n \n But why bother with a device that produces near-threshold hearing sensations? There are simpler ways to harass people if that is the goal. Even now, a year after the incidents were reported, the facts of the matter remain unclear. A follow-up medical examination of 21 of the affected individuals by a neuroscience group led by Doug Smith at the University of Pennsylvania (my colleagues, in fact) found equivocal evidence the individuals had sustained “injury to widespread brain networks”. Neuroskeptic, a neuroscientist who blogs anonymously in Discover magazine, brutally reviewed the Penn study. The blogger and other critical scientists suggested the findings were statistical artifacts due to the many tests the Penn group employed on the subjects. Other scientists have argued psychological factors were involved instead. Taken together, the results seem too scattered to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. \n \n In October 2017 Josh Lederman and Michael Weissenstein from the Associated Press made recordings available of the sounds that the employees reported hearing. If those indeed were the sounds, that would rule out the microwave auditory effect where the microwave-induced vibrations exist only within the head. Chen Yan, Kevin Fu and Wenyuan Xu (of Zhejiang University and the University of Michigan) showed the sounds in the AP recordings are characteristic of those produced by the interaction of two inaudible ultrasound beams via an effect known as intermodulation distortion. Ultrasound is widely used in burglar detectors, room occupancy sensors and other increasingly common appliances, and some individuals report unpleasant audible sensations from such devices. Intermodulation distortion is increasingly being employed to jam microphones used to record concert music illegally or for eavesdropping. Yan and colleagues report ultrasound can be used for eavesdropping purposes as well, by picking up vibrations in objects produced by human speech. \n \n In short, it is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spy tech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel. The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 U.S. election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about U.S. intentions. \n \n There is even a historical parallel to the recent incidents: In 1972 it became publicly known the Soviets had been irradiating the U.S. embassy in Moscow with low-level microwave energy from the 1950s through the 1970s. Neither side disclosed the reason for this. (A reasonable guess is the Russians were trying to disrupt U.S. listening equipment or to collect data from their own bugs in the building.) The media published hyperbolic stories about supposed attempts to harm the embassy staff, fueling a generation of speculation about microwave “neurowarfare.” \n \n We don’t know all the facts about the earlier incidents or the current ones, and no government is likely to provide them. Much of the information available is distinctly anecdotal. The Times story is not “fake news” but the real facts of the matter may be quite different from those presented by its distinguished journalist.', 'Havana (CNN) A Cuban government investigator looking into reports of mysterious acoustic attacks on US and Canadian diplomats on the communist-run island on Monday dismissed a US government theory that microwave weapons emitting concentrated beams of radiation may have been used in the incidents. \n \n ""If you look at the alleged events, there have been reports that there are several people in a room with thick walls and thick windows and only one person was targeted. This is a kind of weapon that doesn\'t exist,"" said Dr. Mitchell Valdes-Sosa, a well-known neurologist who is part of the Cuban special task force investigating the alleged attacks. ""It\'s science fiction, not science,"" he said. \n \n ""First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave. What\'s next, kryptonite?"" the investigator said in an interview with CNN at his research center in Havana, referring to an earlier theory that sonic weapons emitting high-powered ultrasound waves could have caused the injuries. \n \n Valdes-Sosa said researchers and investigators are working on a paper to rebut the microwave weapons theory. \n \n Previously, the government not only denied involvement in the attacks but cast doubt on whether they actually occurred. In June, Cuba\'s Foreign Ministry said ""political motivations"" drove the United States to withdraw its embassy personnel. \n \n Though a March report based on the examinations of 21 diplomats who served in Cuba didn\'t link the attacks to microwaves, the study\'s lead author, Douglas Smith, director of the University of Pennsylvania\'s Center for Brain Injury and Repair, told The New York Times that US diplomats in Cuba and China likely suffered brain injuries and that microwaves are considered the culprit. \n \n Valdes-Sosa said for a microwave weapon to work it would have to been used at a close distance, and none of the diplomats reported seeing the alleged perpetrators. He said that Cuban authorities had investigated the report that one diplomat who suffered an apparent attack had seen a van speed off and that the vehicle belonged to a church. \n \n While the US has not directly blamed the Cuban government for carrying out the attacks, US officials said Cuba is responsible for safeguarding the diplomats well-being and that Cuban officials would likely know if a third government were responsible. \n \n But Valdes-Sosa said after more than a year of US, Canadian and Cuban investigations there was still no hard proof that any attacks actually took place. \n \n ""For an attack to have occurred you have to have a real victim. First the thing we are not sure is if all these people evacuated from Cuba are really ill or have suffered do something that happened to them,"" Valdes-Sosa said. ""Second, you have to have a perpetrator. Who would be interested? You have to have the opportunity."" \n \n In a Sunday interview with CNN, Smith said microwaves are ""a main suspect"" in causing the diplomats\' injuries, but ultrasound and infrasound were being studied as potential causes as well. \n \n JUST WATCHED State Department pulls employees out of Cuba Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH State Department pulls employees out of Cuba 02:34 \n \n ""It\'s almost like a concussion, but without a concussion -- meaning that they look like individuals who have persistent concussion symptoms but have no history of head impact,"" Smith said, describing the injuries and explaining that learning the cause is vital to determining the best means of preventing it. \n \n ""Just like we have ways to prevent people from having a concussion, you could think of maybe protecting your brain from these energy sources,"" he said. \n \n Most of the attacks came in 2016 and 2017, though there have been a handful of reported incidents this year as well. \n \n A senior administration official told CNN that investigators have torn apart buildings where diplomatic employees encountered the sounds but found no acoustic devices, leading law enforcement to believe that the injuries were the result of microwaves beamed from a nearby location and that the ""sounds"" were merely a means of masking the microwave attacks. \n \n This is only a theory, the official said, and there is no concrete evidence to back it. However, brain scans on the injured personnel showed changes that indicate damage, the official said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Trump: Cuba \'responsible\' for diplomat attacks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Cuba \'responsible\' for diplomat attacks 00:18 \n \n In a statement, the US State Department on Sunday neither confirmed nor denied the possibility that microwaves were behind the diplomatic injuries. \n \n ""The health and well-being of our personnel remains our top priority,"" the statement said. ""The investigation into the origin of these symptoms continues. The inter-agency community is working diligently to determine the cause of the symptoms, as well as to develop mitigation strategies."" \n \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this year he was establishing a Health Incidents Response Task Force , led by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and including representatives from the departments of Justice as well as Health and Human Services. \n \n The task force will serve as the ""coordinating body for department and interagency activities, including identification and treatment of affected personnel and family members, investigation and risk mitigation, messaging, and diplomatic outreach,"" Pompeo said in a statement. \n \n The sophistication of the attack has led US officials to suspect a third country is involved, perhaps as retribution against the United States or Canada -- whose diplomats have also been targeted -- or to drive a wedge between those countries and Cuba. \n \n In August 2017, officials included Russia among a list of countries that have an adversarial relationship with the United States and that American investigators suspected might be involved.', 'Burning Man is a lot of things, and every time we try to say what it is or isn’t, we fail. But we do know that there are some things that are undeniably true. One of them is that Burning Man is a family affair. \n \n The latest example we present is Audrey Pickney, one of only two second-generation DPW workers. (Welboy’s son, Corey, is the other, but he’s not able to be here this year.) \n \n Audrey is in her second year of working DPW, after three years working with Gate, Perimeter and Exodus. Her mom, Ridge, is a longtime DPW worker who’s also taking a year off this year, so Audrey is holding down the family presence. \n \n She goes to the School of the Art Institute of the Chicago, where she is studying fashion and fibers, the art of sewing. It’s wildly expensive, but a variety of fellowships and grants have her about a semester and a half from graduation. \n \n You’d think it would be a stretch to come out here after the urban art world in Chicago, but she’s been doing it for so long, it seems perfectly normal. Her first year was 2002, when she was nine years old. That’s right, nine, so she’s kind of a poster child for young Burners, too. \n \n Her mom started coming to Burning Man in 2001, and she loved it, and she thought that Audrey would like it, too. So she brought her, and she’s been coming ever since. She’s missed a Burn here and there for school reasons, but still. That’s a lot of her youth spent in the desert. \n \n “I love it here,” she says down at the Depot as the day winds to a close and the heat is finally letting up. “All my people are here. … I love doing work with my hands, I love the desert … like, why would I not?” \n \n She has an infectious laugh, and her manner is easy and open. She seems so natural at an age, 22, when so many others are still trying to figure out who they are, trying on different personas. But she seems as free of artifice as the desert hills. Did coming out to the Burn help her learn how to deal with stressful conditions with grace and humor? Hard to say, but it seems pretty clear that it didn’t hurt. \n \n Does she think that Burning Man, or coming out to work on the build, is the kind of thing that could last for generations? Could it be handed down, complete with legends and stories and oral histories? \n \n “Well, I don’t know,” she says indulgently. “But my grandpa comes here, too.” \n \n That would be Donovan, whom we met last year at one of the most raucous events of Burning Man, the DPW parade. We made sure to take a picture of all three generations who were attending. And we’d seen that before, the multi-generational experience. But we hadn’t heard of many second-generation DPW workers. \n \n The event has a wild reputation, and deservedly so. You can find a lot of what you’re looking for out here, be it personal growth, sexual exploration, spiritual connection. We can say that Burning Man has earned its reputation, so one could arrive expecting to have a completely wild and racy time. \n \n But it’s not always like that. “It’s like a family and a community of people,” Audrey says. “You know, in the real world, we’re all a bunch of fucking weirdos, and we’re all probably kind of a little bit antisocial. But out here, we’re all like that, like, let it all hang out.” She laughs easily again. “You know?” Yes, we know. \n \n “It’s like the perfect little niche. It’s not for everybody, but if it is for you, you definitely know it.” \n \n In other news: \n \n You may have seen the bug rumors on the internet. We are here to tell you that they are all true. Well maybe not all of the rumors, but the bugs are real. They’re everywhere. They bite. They crawl all over you. They get up and in you. \n \n Twin Peaks, who’s leading the construction of the Center Café, was talking about how bad they are when she jumped a little and pulled her t-shirt away from her body. A good-sized green bug fell to the ground. It had crawled into her bra. \n \n Metal Shop Heather wears a welding mask most of the day. Bugs have crawled up inside her visor and nestled around her eyes. Cammy and Stinger needed some help from the medical team to deal with the infestation; Stinger’s back was covered with nasty red welts from the bites. \n \n What’s going on? We don’t know. We don’t know how the little critters survive in the heat and the sun. All we know is that if you pick up some wood, you’re likely to uncover hundreds or thousands of the things. They’ve blown up inches deep against the sides of the Commissary tent. They’ve covered the carpets at the Depot. They’re all over the Man Base. So it’s not a localized occurrence, it’s everywhere. \n \n We don’t know where they came from, but there are two main theories: One is that all the spring and summer rain has hatched critters that lie dormant, or usually come to life at a different time of year. Or maybe they hitchhiked in on a load of wood from somewhere. Or maybe, as Shade postulated out at Man Base, there’s a Johnny Bugseed making the rounds at night, sprinkling them anywhere and everywhere. \n \n We’ve been blessed by fair skies so far during the build. For the first time in the past several years, there’s been no rain or lightning or hail or high winds to bring things to a crawl. But maybe we are making our way around the various plagues, and this year it’s time for pestilence. \n \n Marcia said that one had flown into her mouth gotten lodged between her teeth. She reports that they are quite bitter to the taste. \n \n We don’t know how long it will last. Cobra Commander said at the morning meeting that high temperatures will be with us again today, and the hope is that the heat and the dryness will knock down the bug population. “Because otherwise we’re gonna have to nuke the city” to get rid of them.']",3,"– Microwave weapons? That's the latest theory being floated to explain the mysterious ailments suffered by staffers at the American embassy in Cuba. But now a pioneering scientist in that field thinks the idea—based on a principle called the microwave auditory effect—is bogus. Kenneth Foster is a professor of bioengineering at Penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study. At Scientific American, he assesses what's known about the Cuban ailments and lays out why it's ""wildly implausible"" that microwaves are to blame. For one thing, any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims, too, and that didn't happen. Instead, Foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely. ""It is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spytech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel,"" he writes. Foster cites this earlier investigation from the AP revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard, and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other. It makes sense to him that the Cubans might have been trying to listen in on Americans with these relatively common gizmos. ""The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 US election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about US intentions."" A Cuban scientist, meanwhile, agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched. ""First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave,"" he told CNN. ""What's next, kryptonite?"""

He also wants to review the surveillance tape before making his decision.', 'This wasn’t the kind of bottle service NBA star Tony Parker had in mind. \n \n The San Antonio Spurs guard (pictured) — injured in the Chris Brown-Drake melee at a SoHo nightclub — filed a $20 million lawsuit against its owners yesterday, saying they should have known better than to let the Rihanna love rivals in at the same time. \n \n In papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, Parker holds W.i.P.’s owners responsible for the “corneal laceration of the left eye and other injuries” he suffered in the bottle-throwing brawl at the now-shuttered Vandam Street club. \n \n His lawyer, David Jaroslawicz, said the extent of Parker’s wounds aren’t yet known, but noted eye injuries “certainly don’t improve your outside shot.” \n \n The suit does not name Brown or Drake, who have both dated Rihanna, as defendants, but blames the club for creating the combustible combination. \n \n “She’s been known, like Helen of Troy, to cause trouble,” Jaroslawicz said. \n \n Sources said Drake, 25, sent Brown, 23, into a rage when his table sent over a note that read, “I am f–king the love of your life.” \n \n Brown had just bought the hip-hop star a pricey bottle of champagne, sources said. Drake’s camp maintains the fight was instigated by a member of Brown’s crew. \n \n Jaroslawicz said it’s the club’s fault. By selling both camps bottle service, “you’re throwing gasoline on the flames,” he said. \n \n The suit says Parker, 30, ex-hubby of actress Eva Longoria, wasn’t sitting with either camp. But he has said he was “with my friend Chris Brown” when the problems started. “They started throwing bottles everywhere,” he said. \n \n Parker, slated to play with the French team at the Summer Olympics, said he’ll be sidelined for a week as he heals with the aid of a “therapeutic” contact lens. \n \n “I’ll be missing the start of the French team because I can’t do anything for a week except keep the lens in and then take drops,” he said. \n \n A representative for the club declined to comment.']",2,"– The fallout from Chris Brown's throwdown with Drake's entourage continues: Now Tony Parker is suing the New York City nightclub where it happened for a cool $20 million. The NBA star says the club, WiP, should have known that allowing Brown and Drake—who've both been involved with Rihanna—in at the same time was a terrible idea. Thus, the lawsuit claims, the club owners are responsible for the injuries he suffered in the fight. Those injuries include a ""corneal laceration of the left eye,"" the lawsuit claims, and Parker's lawyer notes that eye injuries ""certainly don't improve your outside shot."" The lawyer also, amusingly, says of Rihanna: ""She’s been known, like Helen of Troy, to cause trouble."" The brawl started after Drake sent the following classy note to Brown's table, sources tell the New York Post: ""I am f***ing the love of your life."" Neither Brown nor Drake are named in the suit.

134,"['WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama reported assets worth between $1.8 million and $7 million for last year, little changed from their previous year\'s holdings, according to financial disclosure forms released Thursday. \n \n The forms, required by law, permit public officials to list their assets in broad ranges. As a result, a precise net worth is difficult to ascertain. \n \n The forms show the largest jointly owned assets by the president and the first lady were Treasury notes worth between $1 million and $5 million. While the value of their assets is certainly higher than that of most Americans, their mix reflects the financial demands of a 50-something couple with two daughters. Their assets include Vanguard retirement funds and college savings plans. \n \n Royalties in 2013 from Obama\'s books, ""Dreams From My Father,"" \'\'The Audacity of Hope"" and ""Of Thee I Sing,"" totaled between $70,000 and $165,000. In 2011, they totaled between $250,000 and $2.1 million. \n \n The Obamas also have a 30-year mortgage on their Chicago home worth between $500,000 and $1 million with an interest rate of 5.625 percent. \n \n Vice President Joe Biden reported 2013 assets of between $276,000 and $940,000, including a rental property owned jointly with his wife, Jill, in Wilmington, Delaware. \n \n Unlike the Obamas, Biden has taken advantage of lower mortgage rates and refinanced his mortgage last year. He listed a 30-year mortgage on his principal residence and his rental property worth between $500,000 and $1 million with an interest rate of 3.375 percent. \n \n Biden also reported making $25,000 donations to each of two Pennsylvania anti-domestic violence groups. The $50,000 came from an award Biden received from the Pennsylvania Society, which honored Biden last year with its gold medal for distinguished achievement, \n \n Last month, the Obamas released their 2013 tax returns and reported paying $98,169 in taxes on $481,098 in adjusted income. \n \n The Bidens reported paying $96,378 in federal taxes last year on adjusted gross income of $407,009.', 'Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The assets of President Obama and his wife, Michelle, were valued as high as $7 million last year, according to a financial disclosure form released by the White House on Thursday. \n \n Most of the president’s income came from royalties on his three books and investments made possible by the proceeds. His memoir, “Dreams From My Father,” published in 1995, continued to make the most money for Mr. Obama, generating between $50,001 and $100,000 in royalties, according to the disclosure form. “The Audacity of Hope,” from 2006, earned between $15,001 and $50,000, and “Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters,” released in 2010, earned between $5,001 and $15,000. \n \n Sales from Mr. Obama’s books have decreased steadily every year since he took office as president, according to the disclosure forms the White House has released. \n \n Treasury notes held jointly by the president and Mrs. Obama are their most valuable assets, worth between $1 million and $5 million. The forms only require the Obamas to list their assets and income in wide ranges, leaving it difficult to discern the exact amount of the couple’s worth in 2013. \n \n Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s publishing career earned him considerably less than the president’s totals. “Promises to Keep,” released in 2007, earned less than $201 in royalties last year, according to Mr. Biden’s financial disclosure form, also released on Thursday. \n \n The Obamas’ 2013 tax returns, released in April, showed they paid $98,169 in federal taxes on $481,098 in adjusted gross income. The Bidens paid $96,378 in taxes on an adjusted gross income of $407,009. \n \n The Obama administration was the first to publish financial disclosure reports online. High-ranking government officials have been have been required to release their financial information since passage of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. \n \n “Neither the president nor the vice president have any conflicts of interest, and their reports have been reviewed and certified by the independent Office of Government Ethics,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. “We are continuing this administration’s practice of posting these forms online here in the interests of transparency.”']",2,"– Barack Obama may not be Mitt-Romney-rich (or even Al-Gore-rich), but he's doing all right for himself. The president's latest financial disclosure forms, released yesterday, reveal that he and Michelle had total assets worth somewhere between $1.8 million and $7 million in 2013, the AP reports. (That's just like 2012.) Most of that is in US Treasury notes, which are worth between $1 million and $5 million. Other assets include Vanguard retirement funds and college saving funds. Current financial disclosure rules only require politicians to list their assets within a broad range, so it's hard to pin down exactly how much Obama has, the New York Times explains. Besides his presidential salary, Obama makes most of his money off royalties from his books, though the market seems to believe he peaked as a writer in the '90s. His latest, 2010's Of Thee I Sing, A Letter to My Daughters, earned between $5,001 and $15,000, compared to $50,001-$100,000 for 1995's Dreams From My Father. But even Of Thee's numbers probably sound good to Joe Biden, who made less than $201 in royalties last year off of his 2007 book Promises to Keep."

Novak and John C. Reilly, is slated to be released May 11.', 'Will Sacha Baron Cohen’s ‘The Dictator’ Walk The Oscar Red Carpet? \n \n UPDATED 5:30 PM WITH MORE DETAILS \n \n EXCLUSIVE… BREAKING 3PM… The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences has pulled actor Sacha Baron Cohen‘s tickets from the 84th Academy Awards. This means he is banned from attending the Oscars even though he is an Academy member and one of the stars from Hugo, Paramount’s 11-nominated movie and Best Picture contender. “Unless they’re assured that nothing entertaining is going to happen on the Red Carpet, the Academy is not admitting Sacha Baron Cohen to the show,” Paramount just told me. The reason is that a proposal reached the Academy for Baron Cohen to strut the Red Carpet in full costume as his title character in the upcoming Paramount comedy The Dictator. UPDATE AT 5:30 PM: Later today, faced with all the bad publicity resulting from its action, the Academy tried to parse what it did when questioned by some media outlets. But the fact is that, this morning, the Academy’s Managing Director Of Membership Kimberly Rouch phoned Paramont’s awards staff to say Baron Cohen’s tickets had been pulled unless he gives the Academy assurances ahead of time promising not to show up on the Red Carpet in costume and not to promote the movie on the Red Carpet. The Academy made it clear that, without those assurances, it would not issue him the tickets. So he’s banned.* \n \n Of course, the next best thing to that publicity stunt is all the media coverage which this ban is going to generate for Baron Cohen’s film. So the Academy has decided to act like dictators about the actor playing The Dictator. Ugh. \n \n Sancha Baron Cohen Today Show Video \n \n Loosen up, people. Frankly, the Academy looks like uptight wankers with this treatment of one of the globe’s funniest comedians. The Academy merely had to say no when that proposal was presented to it. Everyone involved in the ceremony was adamantly against it on the grounds that it makes a mockery of what Hollywood considers its most prestigious event. Instead, the Academy clearly wants another overly long, ridiculously reverential show about movies no one bothered to see where the best thing about the telecast will be the comeback of popular host Billy Crystal at age 63. \n \n UPDATE: Is Academy Blinking On Banning Sacha Baron Cohen From Oscars 2012? \n \n The Dictator is a spoof about the “heroic story of a Middle Eastern dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy never comes to the country he so lovingly oppressed”. Whether the fact that the 84th Academy Awards will be beamed into 200 countries had anything to do with this ban is unclear. But it is highly unusual for the Academy to pull a member’s tickets. An Oscars spokesperson acknowledged to Deadline yesterday: ”We would hope that every studio knows that this is a bad idea. The Red Carpet is not about stunting.” Oh really? Then why did Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park crossdress down the Red Carpet as J-Lo and Gwyneth Paltrow in evening gowns in 2000? Or Ben Stiller appear as an Oscar presenter in full blue Avatar makeup and hair in 2010? \n \n Deadline reported yesterday that Baron Cohen’s plan was to come dressed as The Dictator and then change into a tuxedo and attend the Oscars as planned. He wasn’t scheduled to present an award, but he was arriving at Kodak Theatre as part of the Paramount contingent. Now he can’t do even that. Paramount has a Best Picture nominee in the Martin Scorsese-directed Hugo in which Baron Cohen plays the train station inspector of the movie about an orphan in 1930s Paris. \n \n At the 2007 Oscars, Baron Cohen was asked to be a presenter and said he would do it only if he could be in character as Borat. And Oscars’ Powers That Be said, “No way.” He didn’t attend. But this is the first time he has been officially banned from the show. \n \n Purists feel that the Oscars is no place for such in your face promotion. The Academy hasn’t even allowed movies to be advertised during the Oscarcast, until this year. Then again, these Oscars have very little suspense because it’s a forgone conclusion that many of the winners of the marquee categories are already known and The Artist will win Best Picture.

To promote Bruno, he flew through the air at the MTV Movie Awards and landed with his crotch in the face of Eminem, who later admitted the stunt was rehearsed. And a trailer for The Dictator certainly was one of the raciest ever allowed by the MPAA during the Super Bowl, where Baron Cohen’s character was hilariously depicted running a competitive race while and leg-shooting rivals with a starter pistol as they got close to him. \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here.', 'Contrary to reports, the Academy has not yet pulled Sacha Baron Cohen\'s Oscar tickets over his plan to appear on the red carpet in character for his next movie — but that could still happen \n \n According to an executive with the Academy who did not wish to be identified, AMPAS officials have been in touch with representatives for Baron Cohen since they learned of his plan to attend the Oscars in costume as the title character in ""The Dictator."" \n \n Their message to British comic was clear: ""Our red carpet is not for stunting."" \n \n The Academy is now waiting for a response from Baron Cohen\'s camp; once they receive one, they will decide whether he can use the tickets he received as a cast member of the Best Picture nominee ""Hugo."" \n \n Baron Cohen would have done red carpet interviews in character – and if his past appearances as Borat and Bruno were any indication, would have used the occasion to be disruptive (and probably pretty funny). \n \n Also read: \'The Dictator\' Trailer: Sacha Baron Cohen Laughs in the Face of Tyranny (Video) \n \n Baron Cohen caused problems for the Oscars four years ago, when they asked him to present but he insisted on doing so only in character, as Borat.

137,"['ROME — If the paragon of all Christmas trees is the one in front of the Rockefeller Center in New York — first erected, mind you, by an Italian in 1931 — the prize for most pitiful must go to the one that stands in Rome’s Piazza Venezia this year. Just days after it was put up, it began to gray and shed its needles, and soon it had become nearly see-through. The tree cuts so sad and forlorn a figure that it has been nicknamed Spelacchio, or Mangy. \n \n Spelacchio arrived in Rome early this month from the Trentino region, near Italy’s border with Austria, and what with transport expenses and decorations, the 70-foot fir is estimated to have cost Italian taxpayers 48,000 euros, or $57,000. It’s not clear what has ailed it. Maybe Spelacchio was unsettled by the trip; perhaps it was ill on departure. By way of explanation, Antimo Palumbo, a tree historian who was standing by Spelacchio’s side on Friday morning, pointed at the concrete all over its roots. “You see that?” he told me. “They decided to pour the concrete to keep it steady, but that killed it instead.” \n \n There isn’t enough time, money or political will to replace the tree, and so Spelacchio the Mangy will stay in Piazza Venezia through the holidays, and for many locals it has already become a metaphor for what’s wrong with the city, and the country. \n \n Traffic in Rome is chronically congested, public transport is inefficient, trash collection is slow and sporadic. Early hopes about Virginia Raggi, who was elected mayor last year on an anti-establishment agenda, promptly faded amid familiar allegations of corruption and nepotism.', 'ROME — No sooner had workers hoisted a 72-foot tall Norway spruce in Rome’s central Piazza Venezia this month than the mocking began. \n \n The tree was quickly nicknamed Spelacchio, or Mangy, because so many of its dead needles were dropping off, leaving the tree looking a bit bare. Chatter spread quickly on social media where Romans traded jokes about the spruce and criticized its sad appearance. \n \n Insults quickly turned to intrigue as the Italian media plumbed the tree’s costs, questioned how it had been transported to the city and analyzed its state of health. \n \n “It has clearly been traumatized,” one expert declared. \n \n A consumer rights group asked an administrative court, which has oversight over government spending, to investigate what it described as a “shameful spectacle for citizens and tourists” and demanded that the tree be removed immediately.', 'Kim Cattrall says she prioritized her role as Samantha on Sex and the City over having children. \n \n The actress, 61, opened up about having considered motherhood during an appearance on Monday’s episode of Piers Morgan’s Life Stories, saying that after she got married to her third husband Mark Levinson in 1998, she thought about starting IVF treatments but decided against it because of the hectic shooting schedule for SATC — which premiered that June. \n \n “I thought to myself, ‘Wow, I have 19-hour days on this series. … My Monday morning would start at 4:45 a.m. and go to one or two in the morning. How could I possibly continue to do that, especially in my early 40s?’ ” she said. “And then I realized what a commitment it was just to the [IVF] procedures.” \n \n “I thought, ‘I don’t think it is going to happen.’ It was the first moment — it was extraordinary — in my life where I thought, ‘Maybe I’m just not going to do this,’” she added. \n \n Cynthia Nixon (left), Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker. Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat \n \n Asked whether she feels maternal, Cattrall replied, “Yes, I think it’s part of being a woman to have that. But obviously fate, timing, luck, destiny, I don’t know.” \n \n That instinct inspired her to mentor young actresses. \n \n “I thought I have a place to be a mom here, not a biological mom but a mom and an auntie and a friend. And that has really given me so much, as much as I give I get two-fold back,” she continued. \n \n Also in the interview, Cattrall said that she was “never friends” with her SATC costars. “We’ve never been friends,” she said. “We’ve been colleagues and in some way, it’s a very healthy place to be.” \n \n The actress addressed reports that her demands led studio Warner Bros. to kill Sex and the City 3, which she called “ridiculous.” \n \n “I never asked for any money,” Cattrall said. “I never asked for any projects, to be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous.” \n \n Cynthia Nixon (left), Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker. Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat \n \n However, sources have told PEOPLE that Cattrall made “outrageous demands” to re-board the movie franchise. \n \n Cattrall “was dragging her feet all summer and cast and crew members had put their lives on hold to get ready to shoot the movie,” said one source. “Then when she made outrageous demands, the studio had enough and pulled the plug. Her demand for them to buy her films in development and to give her a TV deal are what broke the camel’s back for them.” \n \n Rumors that Samantha (Cattrall), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) were reuniting for a new film — which would follow 2008’s Sex and the City and 2010’s Sex and the City 2 — had long swirled, with fans hoping to see the fierce foursome reunited again. \n \n RELATED VIDEO: Kim Cattrall Slams Sarah Jessica Parker as Tensions Surrounding SATC 3 Revealed: ‘Kim Killed the Movie,’ Says Source \n \n But after almost eight years of encouraging words from actors, Parker told Extra on Sept. 28 that any possibility of a third movie is officially “over.” \n \n As previously reported, Cattrall also called out Parker — who would have been a producer on the film — while appearing on the ITV series. \n \n Kim Cattrall (left) and Sarah Jessica Parker.

Others defend the tree, saying it looks OK when it's lit up at night. ""We are all Spelacchio!"" one supporter told a local paper. Per the Times, the tree even has a few Facebook accounts and a Twitter handle in its name, with one tweet proclaiming: ""I have more followers than branches.""

138,"['WASHINGTON — Two and a half weeks after Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced an inquiry into e-mail exchanges between Gen. John R. Allen of the Marines and a socialite in Tampa, Fla., some 15 investigators working seven days a week in the Pentagon inspector general’s office have narrowed their focus to 60 to 70 e-mails that “bear a fair amount of scrutiny,” a defense official said. \n \n The official did not disclose the content of the e-mails, but senior Pentagon officials have described the voluminous correspondence between General Allen, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, and the socialite, Jill Kelley, as potentially “inappropriate communication.” Law enforcement officials say the e-mails number in the hundreds and cover a period of two and a half years starting in 2010, when General Allen was the deputy commander of Central Command, based in Tampa. \n \n The investigation, which is delaying and could derail General Allen’s appointment to be the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe, is on a fast track but is unlikely to be completed before the end of the year. Investigations of senior officers in the inspector general’s office usually take about seven months on average, although normally there are only two or three investigators assigned to a case. \n \n The defense official, who asked not to be named because of the nature of the inquiry, said investigators were trying to determine whether the e-mails violated Defense Department policy, government regulations or military law. They were discovered in the course of an F.B.I. investigation into anonymous e-mails to Ms. Kelley warning her to stay away from David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director. The F.B.I. found that the e-mails had been sent by Paula Broadwell, Mr. Petraeus’s biographer; he admitted to having had an affair with Ms. Broadwell and resigned on Nov. 9. \n \n Like General Allen, Mr. Petraeus, a retired four-star general, was a social acquaintance of Ms. Kelley when he was stationed at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, headquarters of the Central Command. \n \n The e-mails between General Allen and Ms. Kelley were sent to the Pentagon by the F.B.I. on Nov. 11. “They just forwarded the evidence,” the official said, referring to the F.B.I. “People have to go through and decide if they fit one of three potential violations.” Those violations include misconduct, which could range from inappropriate language on a government computer to adultery, prohibited under military law; more than an incidental use of government property for personal matters; and security breaches. \n \n The defense official said there was no evidence so far that there had been security violations. General Allen, who is in Kabul planning the drawdown of American forces from Afghanistan, is cooperating with the investigation and has said through associates that he did not commit adultery. The inquiry does not appear to have progressed to interviews with General Allen, 58, who is married and the father of two, or Ms. Kelley, 37, the wife of a cancer surgeon and the mother of three. \n \n Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who has been nominated to succeed General Allen as part of a regular military rotation, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate before the end of the year and to be in Kabul by February. General Allen is expected to return to the United States at that time, but it is unclear what he will do. \n \n There have been conflicting accounts of the nature of the e-mails between him and Ms. Kelley. A law enforcement official has described some of them as sexually explicit. Pentagon officials briefed on the matter say they have been told that half a dozen are embarrassing. But General Allen’s associates say they are innocuous and contain little beyond language like “you’re a sweetheart.” \n \n Although Ms. Kelley’s e-mail correspondence with General Allen has not been made public, dozens of her e-mails to Mayor Bob Buckhorn of Tampa have been released under Florida’s public record laws and refer to her friendship with both General Allen and Mr. Petraeus. \n \n A year ago, after inviting the mayor to a birthday party for one of her children, she added a casual P.S.: “I’ll be in DC this weekend with Petraeus, but let’s set up a double date when I return!” Last January, she wrote to a mayoral aide, “I’m up in DC having dinner tonight with Gen. Petraeus and Gen. John Allen.”', 'FILE - In this Nov 13, 2012 file photo Jill Kelley leaves her home in Tampa, Fla. The Tampa socialite at the center of a scandal involving Gen.

The Tampa socialite at the center of a scandal involving Gen. David Petraeus has hired a top Washington attorney and seems... (Associated Press) \n \n Jill Kelley wants the world to know that she didn\'t do anything wrong when she befriended top military brass. \n \n The Tampa socialite at the center of a scandal involving Gen. David Petraeus has hired a top Washington attorney and seems to be trying to change the narrative about her friendship with the general, her past and her role as an ""honorary consul"" to the country of South Korea. \n \n On Tuesday, Kelley\'s attorney Abbe Lowell released emails, telephone recordings and other material that he and Kelley say proves she never tried to exploit her friendship with Petraeus. \n \n Lowell wrote to the U.S. Attorney\'s Office in Tampa, demanding to know why the name of his client and her husband were revealed during the FBI\'s investigation of Petraeus and his mistress, Paula Broadwell. \n \n Officials said they were led to Kelley because Broadwell sent her threatening messages to stay away from Petraeus. Lowell addressed this in a letter to W. Stephen Muldrow, the assistant U.S. Attorney in Tampa. \n \n ""You no doubt have seen the tremendous attention that the Kelleys have received in the media,"" Lowell wrote. ""All they did to receive this attention was to let law enforcement know that they had been the subjects of inappropriate and potentially threatening behavior by someone else."" \n \n Lowell added that federal privacy laws could be applicable to the couple\'s information. \n \n ""These leaks most certainly had to come, at least in part, from government sources,"" Lowell said. ""The earliest and best example of the leaks would be the release to the media of the names of my clients. As you know, there are several rules and laws that seek to protect United States citizens against such leaks."" \n \n The U.S. Attorney\'s Office in Tampa did not return telephone calls for comment Tuesday. \n \n Kelley, a 37-year-old mother of three, became the focus of national media attention earlier this month. She and her husband, cancer surgeon Scott Kelley, befriended Petraeus and Gen. John Allen when the generals served at U.S. Central Command, which is headquartered at Tampa\'s MacDill Air Force Base. Kelley became an unofficial social ambassador for the base. She was well known around Tampa\'s social scene and often hosted parties at her waterfront mansion. \n \n When the FBI investigated Broadwell\'s emails to Kelley, they also discovered numerous emails between Kelley and the generals. The Pentagon is investigating the emails between her and Allen. Some have called a few of the emails between the two ""flirtatious,"" but sources close to Kelley say they were not. \n \n The scandal this week cost Kelley her appointment as an honorary consul for the South Korean government, which she had gotten because of her friendship with Petraeus. The Koreans said she had misused the title in her personal business dealings. \n \n Lowell sent another letter to a businessman for whom Kelley tried to broker a deal with South Korea. \n \n The businessman, Adam Victor, said he met Kelley in late August at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, where they discussed having Kelley represent Victor\'s company on a coal-gasification deal it was negotiating with South Korean companies. \n \n On Aug. 30, according to the documents provided by her attorney, Victor sent Kelley an email saying they were seeking bids from four major Korean firms _ Samsung, Hyundai, GS and GK _ and that he expected the bidding to potentially reach $3 billion. There were several back-and-forth emails through mid-September as Victor and Kelley tried to negotiate a fee for her work, with her saying she was seeking 2 percent of the deal and Victor trying to clarify what she meant. \n \n There were no other emails until Victor sent one Nov. 9, when Kelley\'s name surfaced in the Petraeus scandal. He wrote two more times after that before she responded. \n \n When she finally did, he sent back another email in which he remarked, ""When I heard about Petraeus, I thought of you."" In a follow-up email, he asked if she was still in a position to help with Korea. She didn\'t respond. \n \n In a Nov. 14 interview with the AP, Victor said it had become clear that Kelley was not a skilled negotiator and that he had wasted his time dealing with her. \n \n In a letter released Tuesday and dated Nov. 21, Lowell accused Victor of seeking his ""15 minutes of fame"" by talking to the news media about his client. Lowell said Victor had defamed Kelley with his clients and misstated her desire for 2 percent of the profits by saying she wanted 2 percent of the entire deal. Lowell also accused Victor of unspecified inappropriate behavior toward Kelley. \n \n ""If you want to continue seeking publicity for yourself, that is one thing,"" Lowell wrote to Victor. ""However, if you do that by maligning a person, that is something else."" He then accused Victor of casting Kelley in a false light and suggested his attorney contact Lowell to discuss the matter. \n \n Victor told the AP late Tuesday that he never accused Kelley of wrongdoing, but had just said she was naive and not an experienced negotiator. He also said his female assistant was present every time he met with Kelley. \n \n ""It\'s not a crime to be a novice,"" Victor said. ""I don\'t know why they are talking to me."" \n \n The third letter was sent from Kelley\'s attorney Tuesday to the Attorney Consumer Assistance Program, which handles complaints about lawyers on behalf of the Florida Bar. In that letter, Lowell accused Tampa attorney Barry Cohen of breaking attorney-client privilege by publicly speaking about conversations he had with Kelley in 2009 while representing her in a dispute she had with a tenant. In those conversations, Lowell said, they discussed her friendships with various military personnel. \n \n Kelley\'s sister, Natalie Khawam, once worked as an attorney in Cohen\'s firm and later sued him for sexual harassment and breach of contract. In court responses, Cohen said Khawam ""has a judicially documented recent history and continuing propensity for the commission of perjury."" \n \n Cohen said Tuesday evening that he had not seen Lowell\'s complaint letter and that Kelley had ""lost the battle in the court of public opinion."" \n \n ""No matter how many high-priced lawyers and publicists she employs, she has been exposed for what she is,"" he said. \n \n Prior to Tuesday, Kelley, her attorney and her publicist had only publicly addressed the situation once, in a statement to the news media when the scandal first broke. \n \n ___ \n \n Spencer reported from Miami. \n \n Kelley\'s lawyer also sent letters to a New York businessman who accused her of incompetence in her work trying to set up a deal he was negotiating with South Korean companies and a Tampa attorney who accused her of name-dropping and of being a social climber; \n \n Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush']",2,"– The Pentagon inspector general’s office didn't take the Gen. John Allen-Jill Kelley email exchange lightly, assigning 15 investigators toiling seven days a week to review the thousands of pages of documents. They've now sussed out between 60 and 70 emails that ""bear a fair amount of scrutiny,"" according to a defense official, who didn't elaborate on what those emails might contain. The New York Times reports the purpose of the investigation, which likely won't conclude until 2013, is to determine if one of three violations occurred: misconduct (ie, adultery or inappropriate language), substantial use of government property for personal matters, or a security breach. Those investigators aren't the only ones getting busy. A previously silent Kelley is now defending herself, through her attorney. Abbe Lowell, a big-time Washington lawyer who has represented Bill Clinton and John Edwards, yesterday released emails, phone recordings, and more evidence that, he says, prove Kelley did not try to exploit her relationship with David Petraeus. He also sent out three letters connected to the scandal, the AP reports: He asked the US Attorney's Office in Tampa why Kelley's name was released in the first place, adding that federal privacy laws could apply. He wrote another letter to a businessman Kelley was trying to help make a deal with South Korea, before she lost her honorary consul status. The businessman, Adam Victor, has said in interviews that Kelley was not a skilled negotiator, and Lowell says he defamed her in an attempt to bask in his ""15 minutes of fame."" In a letter to the Attorney Consumer Assistance Program (which fields complaints about lawyers), Lowell accuses attorney Barry Cohen of talking publicly about conversations he had with Kelley in 2009, thus breaking attorney-client privilege."

(Photo: WFAA) \n \n DALLAS-- A recently filed lawsuit in Dallas County District Court blames negligence on behalf of the Boy Scouts of America for the death of a Fort Worth teen three months ago. \n \n Reid Comita,15, died from heat stroke while hiking at Buffalo Trail Scout Ranch in June. \n \n ""The Boy Scouts of America are responsible for my son\'s death. It\'s that simple. They are responsible,"" John Comita told WFAA in a sit-down interview. \n \n The new lawsuit outlines a series of allegations surrounding Reid\'s death, namely that he was ""...sent on an extremely aggressive hike"" in temperatures hovering around 100 degrees with a heat index well over that. \n \n The Comita family had specifically signed Reid up for an introductory backpacking class, under adult supervision, because they felt it was the safest option for their son. \n \n ""He wasn\'t an athlete. He wasn\'t prepared to go on an advanced hike,"" his father said. \n \n Photos from the camp\'s Facebook page show rugged, mountainous terrain meandering through Jeff Davis County in southwest Texas. \n \n The petition further contends that Reid didn\'t receive proper training at the camp before being sent out on the more advanced hike and that he was accompanied by only two other teenagers, not the required two adults. \n \n The circumstances have left Copper Comita, Reid\'s mother, baffled, angry and crushed. \n \n ""It doesn\'t take it away. It doesn\'t make it any better. It\'s just that much more pain,"" said Copper. \n \n The lawsuit also outlines communication issues, claiming the Comita family wasn\'t notified of his death for more than four hours. \n \n ""We were calling, and no one could give us a straight answer as to how he was,"" said Copper. \n \n The backpacking course would have been Reid\'s final task to accomplish Eagle Scout. His troop has since awarded him the honor posthumously. \n \n ""His friends, his troop, have been great,"" says John. ""But we haven\'t heard from the BSA or organization at all."" \n \n The BSA sent WFAA the following statement: \n \n “This remains a difficult time for our Scouting community, and we continue to keep the family in our thoughts and prayers. The health and safety of our youth members is of paramount importance to the BSA, and integral to everything we do. We strive to create a safe environment for youth to experience outdoor adventure."" \n \n For Copper, the loss of a son who excelled in studies and choir when he wasn\'t earning merit badges, is a void that simply can\'t be filled. \n \n ""He was very special,"" she said. \n \n John says he grew up participating in the Boy Scouts, and that he always felt it was something he could proudly share with his son. \n \n ""It was great bonding for us,"" he said.

The Texas teenager died from heat stroke in June while on an ""Intro to Backpacking"" course that would have been his final task to become an Eagle Scout. ""The Boy Scouts of America are responsible for my son's death. It's that simple,"" father John Comita tells WFAA. Reid's parents are suing Boy Scouts of America, accusing them of being negligent by sending the boy on an ""extremely aggressive hike"" through rugged terrain in southwest Texas on a day when temperatures were around 100 degrees. ""He wasn't an athlete. He wasn't prepared to go on an advanced hike,"" the father says. John Comita says the family signed Reid up for the course—which was supposed to include two days of training followed by a three-day hike—because they thought it was the safest option, but he was immediately sent on the hike, reports the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The lawsuit also faults the Boy Scouts for sending Reid on a hike with two other teenagers, a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, instead of the two adults that regulations require. Boy Scouts of America, which awarded Reid the rank of Eagle Scout after his death, declined to comment on the lawsuit but said the ""health and safety of our youth members is of paramount importance,"" the Washington Post reports. (This woman got sick on a hike and was dead 9 hours later.)"
140,"['Jihan Nassar, a homemaker in Corona, Calif., is listed as a $500 donor to the campaign of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. But she insists she never gave a dime. \n \n \'\'I can\'t make any donations, financially,\'\' Nassar said Friday. ""We never made any donations, sir. I have no idea what you are talking about.\'\' \n \n Nassar and her husband, Waleed, are among more than three dozen California donors listed as giving to Crist\'s campaign on June 19, 2006 -- donations bundled by a controversial Delray Beach defense contractor now under scrutiny for contributions to GOP presidential candidate John McCain. \n \n On Thursday, the McCain campaign said it would return $50,000 in donations tied to businessman Harry Sargeant III, finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a college buddy of Crist\'s. Sargeant has said the California donors were solicited by a business partner, Mustafa Abu Naba\'a, a Jordanian with an apartment in Miami-Dade, records show. \n \n McCain -- a champion of campaign-finance reform in the U.S. Senate -- said he would return the donations after news articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times raised questions about their legitimacy. \n \n In a letter to the donors, the campaign warned that foreign nationals cannot donate money to U.S. campaigns and contributors cannot be reimbursed by another donor as a way to get around contribution limits. \n \n Some donors whose contributions are being returned by McCain\'s campaign were also listed as contributors to Crist on June 19, 2006. \n \n That day, Crist received more than $25,000 in contributions from California, records show, including $500 checks from two stereo stores and two Wienerschnitzel hot-dog restaurants outside Los Angeles. \n \n Zouhair El Srouji, a 40-year-old accountant in Wildomar, Calif., initially told a reporter on Friday that he had no memory of a $500 donation to the Florida governor. \n \n After reviewing campaign records, however, he said he recalled that a campaign contribution was requested by his employer -- though he couldn\'t recall who asked him to give. \n \n \'\'It took a lot of convincing, but they said he was a good man and needed our help, and I guess I\'m a sucker for helping good people,\'\' El Srouji said. \n \n Reached briefly to talk about his just-announced Dec. 12 wedding date with fiancee Carole Rome, Crist said he wasn\'t familiar with the specifics and referred questions to his former campaign manager, George LeMieux. \'\'It\'s all good,\'\' Crist said. \n \n Earlier in the week, he called Sargeant ""a great patriot.\'\' \n \n LeMieux said he would review the donations highlighted by The Miami Herald. \n \n He said every effort was made during the campaign to verify all donations and make sure they did not exceed campaign finance limits. Crist received more than 18,000 checks in the Republican primary, he said. \n \n \'\'With that volume of checks, we\'re not going to know everyone who gives money,\'\' LeMieux said. ""I remember many a long weekend trying to look up information about donors on the Internet.\'\' \n \n The controversy over the donations comes at an awkward time for Crist, one of several politicians auditioning to be McCain\'s vice-presidential candidate. \n \n Sargeant, a fraternity brother of Crist\'s at Florida State University, was one of the governor\'s biggest supporters in the 2006 campaign, and he has emerged in recent months as a top fundraiser for McCain as well. \n \n Sargeant is among 63 McCain fundraisers nationwide who have bundled more than $500,000 in checks each. Donations to presidential candidates are capped at $2,300, but bundlers get around the limit by collecting checks from friends, business associates and relatives. \n \n Sargeant also donated $30,000 of his own money to a joint McCain-GOP fund in May, records show. Before turning his attention to McCain, Sargeant also raised money for presidential candidates Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton. \n \n On March 5 -- the same day President Bush received McCain at the White House as the GOP\'s presumptive nominee -- Sargeant hosted a fundraiser for McCain at his $8.3 million Delray Beach home. \n \n Sid Dinerstein, chairman of the Palm Beach County Republican Party, attended the affair at the waterfront home. He said McCain is \'\'bending over backwards\'\' by returning contributions. \n \n \'\'By giving the money back he is raising flags that weren\'t even there,\'\' Dinerstein said. ""John McCain puts the ethics bar higher than anyone in national politics.\'\' \n \n Sargeant could not be reached for comment on Friday, and a lawyer for his company did not respond to a list of e-mailed questions. \n \n Tallahassee lobbyist Brian Ballard, a top fundraiser for both Crist and McCain, said the reason Sargeant took the position as the state GOP\'s finance chairman was simple: Crist asked him to do it. \n \n Sargeant was not involved in President Bush\'s campaigns, which took the practice of bundling to new heights by designating its biggest givers as \'\'Rangers\'\' and ""Pioneers.\'\' \n \n \'\'Harry does politics now only because his friend of 30 years asked him to take this role,\'\' Ballard said. ""He\'s very much apolitical. He runs tankers and ports.\'\' \n \n Under Sargeant\'s leadership, the Republican Party of Florida raised $15 million in 2007, a record for a nonelection year. Chairman Jim Greer said he has no reason to review the checks Sargeant has delivered to the party. \n \n \'\'He continues to have my full support and appreciation for his service,\'\' Greer said. ""He\'s very dedicated and exhibited a high degree of integrity.\'\' \n \n For someone at the top of the fundraising heap, Sargeant has kept a low profile. Several activists and fundraisers who have been involved in Republican politics for years said they had never met him. \n \n But Sargeant\'s business has received some unwanted attention. \n \n Sargeant is a partner with Abu Naba\'a in International Oil Trading Co., a Boca Raton firm with Defense Department contracts to ship oil to the military in Iraq. Federal records show the company received $601 million in the 2007 budget year. \n \n In June, U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., head of a congressional oversight committee, sent a letter to Sargeant seeking records in a probe of alleged overcharging of the military for fuel costs. \n \n Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a have also been accused of fraud by the brother-in-law of the king of Jordan, who filed a lawsuit in West Palm Beach in April saying the pair cut him out of the Pentagon contracts after he helped them secure the deal. \n \n The ex-partner, Mohammad Al-Saleh, said he helped the company win the blessing of the Jordanian government to ship the oil through that country to Iraq -- a requirement of the Pentagon contracts, according to the suit. Al-Saleh said Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a failed to pay him at least $13 million. \n \n In court papers, lawyers for Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a denied any wrongdoing and said the suit should be moved to Jordan. Sargeant and his family also own domestic shipping and asphalt companies, records show.', 'You\'ve probably never heard of Marty Martin. He spent most of his life as an anonymous CIA operative. But he very recently came out of the closet as the man Bush put in charge of finding Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of 9/11, and guess what? It turns out the man Bush put in charge of finding bin Laden is an extremely shady and allegedly corrupt war profiteer. Who would have thought? \n \n Martin, of course, never succeeded in catching bin Laden. He ran the CIA\'s bin Laden unit from 2002 to 2004, a fact that we now know only because he emerged to grab some credit for bin Laden\'s death and celebrate the agency\'s discontinued torture program: ""We got beat up for it, but those efforts led to this great day,"" he told the Associated Press three weeks ago. Prior to that, he was just a nondescript former agency official who went into the security consulting business after retiring. The closest hint to just how key an official he was came from references to a ""Marty M.""—described as a sort of Jack Bauer of the bayou—in former CIA director George Tenet\'s memoir. \n \n Now that we know who Martin really is, we can get a sense of what kind of guy Bush turned to for arguably the most crucial job in the war on terror. \n \n 1. The Kind of Guy Who Bilks Taxpayers for His Own Enrichment \n \n In 2007, after leaving the CIA, Martin joined International Oil Trading Company, a Florida company that delivered fuel to U.S. forces in the Middle East. In 2008, congressional investigators accused it of ripping off the Pentagon to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. This year, the Pentagon\'s own audit found that the company overcharged the government by as much as $204 million on a series of massive Iraq war fuel contracts. \n \n 2. The Kind of Guy Who Bribes Foreign Officials \n \n According to a Florida lawsuit against International Oil\'s owner Harry Sargeant III, Martin paid a $9 million bribe to the head of the Jordanian intelligence service back in 2007 to secure his company\'s exclusive rights to ship fuel across Jordan to U.S bases in Iraq. (That allegation comes from the Jordanian king\'s brother-in-law, Mohammad al-Saleh, who is suing Sargeant for purportedly screwing him out of a $100 million stake in the company.) \n \n 3. The Kind of Guy Who Helps Launder Illegal Political Contributions \n \n In 2008, the Washington Post reported that Sargeant, a billionaire, raised funds for John McCain\'s presidential campaign with help from an unnamed ""former head of the bin Laden unit"" who worked for him. The men reportedly skirted campaign finance laws by funneling the money through Arab-American ""straw donors."" McCain quickly returned $50,000 of Sargeant\'s lucre. The Post never named the ex-chief of the CIA bin Laden unit involved in the fundraising, but unless two former heads of the bin Laden unit were working for Sargeant at the time, that man was Marty Martin. \n \n 4. The Kind of Guy Who Gets Totally Psyched When People Die In a War He Profits From \n \n In a court filing last week, attorneys for al-Saleh quoted from an e-mail that Martin wrote to Sargeant in 2008 in which he appeared to gloat over the escalation of violence in Iraq: \n \n Fyi, word of a \'re-surge\' is floating around amidst shit hitting the fan in Iraq today. ☺ \n \n The ""shit hitting the fan"" was the Battle of Basra, the Iraqi Army\'s attempt in March 2008 to finally roll up militias loyal to Moqtada al Sadr. It was widely seen as a debacle and victory for al-Sadr, and many feared the conflict threatened to reignite the civil war. That month, 40 Americans died in Iraq. ☺! \n \n In other words, he\'s a former CIA agent. Anyway, that\'s Marty Martin, the guy Bush put in charge of the bin Laden hunt. Glad it worked out for him. \n \n Harry Sargeant\'s lawyers couldn\'t be reached for comment on this story. The CIA declined to comment. And Marty Martin\'s bin Laden-hunting predecessor, Michael Scheuer –- who served for two years as a special adviser to Martin\'s unit –- claims to have never heard of Marty Martin (which we can only presume is a CIA first-rule-of-Fight-Club omerta thing). Reached on his phone, Martin said: ""No no, man. I don\'t want to talk to you, man,"" and hung up before we had a chance to ask a question. \n \n [Image via AP]', 'A member of Jordan’s royal family is accusing an American oilman and former GOP fundraiser of bribing the Jordanian government to facilitate his fuel shipments through the country to U.S. forces in Iraq. \n \n The allegation emerged in a civil lawsuit pitting the billionaire American businessman, Harry Sargeant III, against an ex-business partner, Mohammad al-Saleh, the brother-in-law of Jordan’s King Abdullah II. \n \n Al-Saleh, the plaintiff in the case first reported by NBC News in May 2008, claims that he was cut out of a lucrative one-third share in Sargeant’s firm, the International Oil Trading Co., based in Boca Raton, Fla., and replaced by an ex-CIA official with deep contacts in the Jordanian government. \n \n The crux of the bribery allegation involves a $9 million wire transfer from Sargeant’s firm, directed to a mysterious figure in Jordan’s intelligence agency identified in court documents only as “Pasha.” \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers acknowledge that “Pasha” was “possibly” Gen. Mohammad Dahabi, then head of the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), Jordan’s intelligence agency. A source inside the Jordanian government confirmed that. \n \n Kickback or legitimate payment? \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers argue in court documents that the money was a kickback to curry favor with the GID and secure Sargeant’s continued use of Jordanian thoroughfares to ship fuel to U.S. bases in western Iraq. \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers insist the $9 million was payment to a “quasi-government” Jordanian company that was a subcontractor for Sargeant’s firm and deny any wrongdoing by their client. \n \n Sargeant, a retired Marine pilot and former official of the Florida state GOP, was once among the Pentagon’s closest business partners, winning billions of dollars in fuel contracts in the Iraq war. But fallout from the contracts has eroded Sargeant’s reputation. \n \n A congressional probe led by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., concluded in October 2008 that Sargeant had exploited his close ties with the Jordanian monarchy to win an exclusive license — a so-called letter of authorization that permitted his company to ship the fuel through Jordan to Iraq, as the contracts required. \n \n Sargeant used his “effective monopoly” over the supply routes to grossly overcharge the Pentagon, Waxman wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Waxman called it “the worst form of war profiteering.” \n \n Shortly after the probe, Sargeant resigned as the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party. \n \n Last month, a Pentagon audit requested by Waxman found that Sargeant was overpaid by as much as $204 million for the fuel contracts, which were worth nearly $2.7 billion over six years. The Defense Department accepted Sargeant’s inflated prices because no other competitor could get the letter of authorization from the Jordanian government, the audit said. \n \n Ex-CIA agent hired \n \n Now Al-Saleh’s lawsuit is dredging up new information about Sargeant’s dealings with the Jordanian government. \n \n Among other things, court records indicate that Sargeant hired Marty Martin, a former member of the CIA’s Senior Intelligence Service, to help manage his oil firm in 2007. Martin — identified in court documents as a former Middle East CIA station chief — leveraged his contacts in the Arab world to cement Sargeant’s relationship with the Jordanian government, even as the king’s brother-in-law was being forced out of the oil company and defrauded, al-Saleh’s lawyers contend. \n \n The money transfer at the core of the bribery allegation is revealed in a November 2007 email from Martin to a representative of the Jordanian intelligence service. In it, Martin wrote that $4.5 million had been “transferred to the designated account for the Pasha’s attention.” \n \n Three days later, Martin wrote again to confirm that a “second tranche of $4.5 million should also hit your account today.” He added, “Please advise Pasha.” \n \n A high-placed source inside the Jordanian government confirmed that the “Pasha” alluded to in the emails was Dahabi, then head of the GID. The source, who requested anonymity, said the payments were “being made to the GID,” and added, “A simple trace on the wires will easily reveal who the beneficiaries were and the bank account details.” \n \n The GID is the Jordanian counterpart to the CIA, and the two agencies have reportedly cooperated in the secret rendition of terrorist suspects. In a report this year, Human Rights Watch portrayed the GID as a vast shadow force in Jordan, harassing dissidents and “influenc(ing) decisions in most aspects of Jordanian public life.” \n \n Violation of anti-bribery law alleged \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers allege in court documents that Martin’s payments to the GID may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \n \n But Sargeant’s lawyers, Mark Tuohey and Roger Kobert, said the wires were destined for Taurus Trading Co., a Jordanian firm that provided ground services for Sargeant as a subcontractor. The lawyers characterized Taurus Trading Co. as a “quasi-government entity” and said the Jordanian government was a paid third party in Sargeant’s defense work. Taurus Trading Co. did not respond to emails requesting comment, nor did the Jordanian Embassy in Washington. \n \n Asked why the director of the GID would be involved in the wire transfers, Kobert responded, “You’d have to ask him.” \n \n Dahabi, who was the GID’s director in 2007, did not answer calls to his cellphone. \n \n Martin did not reply to emails or phone calls seeking comment. \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers accuse al-Saleh’s side of taking the wire transfers out of context. “They try to make something very mundane and boring sound sexy,” said Kobert. “It’s not sexy.” \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers have cited another email that they argue shows Martin plotting to cut al-Saleh out of his one-third stake in the oil firm.', 'WASHINGTON -- When one of Osama bin Laden\'s most trusted aides picked up the phone last year, he unknowingly led U.S. pursuers to the doorstep of his boss, the world\'s most wanted terrorist. \n \n That phone call, recounted Monday by a U.S. official, ended a years-long search for bin Laden\'s personal courier, the key break in a worldwide manhunt. The courier, in turn, led U.S. intelligence to a walled compound in northeast Pakistan, where a team of Navy SEALs shot bin Laden to death. \n \n The violent final minutes were the culmination of years of intelligence work. Inside the CIA team hunting bin Laden, it always was clear that bin Laden\'s vulnerability was his couriers. He was too smart to let al-Qaida foot soldiers, or even his senior commanders, know his hideout. But if he wanted to get his messages out, somebody had to carry them, someone bin Laden trusted with his life. \n \n In a secret CIA prison in Eastern Europe years ago, al-Qaida\'s No. 3 leader, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, gave authorities the nicknames of several of bin Laden\'s couriers, four former U.S. intelligence officials said. Those names were among thousands of leads the CIA was pursuing. \n \n One man became a particular interest for the agency when another detainee, Abu Faraj al-Libi, told interrogators that when he was promoted to succeed Mohammed as al-Qaida\'s operational leader he received the word through a courier. Only bin Laden would have given al-Libi that promotion, CIA officials believed. \n \n If they could find that courier, they\'d find bin Laden. \n \n The revelation that intelligence gleaned from the CIA\'s so-called black sites helped kill bin Laden was seen as vindication for many intelligence officials who have been repeatedly investigated and criticized for their involvement in a program that involved the harshest interrogation methods in U.S. history. \n \n ""We got beat up for it, but those efforts led to this great day,"" said Marty Martin, a retired CIA officer who for years led the hunt for bin Laden. \n \n Mohammed did not reveal the names while being subjected to the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding, former officials said. He identified them many months later under standard interrogation, they said, leaving it once again up for debate as to whether the harsh technique was a valuable tool or an unnecessarily violent tactic. \n \n It took years of work for intelligence agencies to identify the courier\'s real name, which officials are not disclosing. When they did identify him, he was nowhere to be found. The CIA\'s sources didn\'t know where he was hiding. Bin Laden was famously insistent that no phones or computers be used near him, so the eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency kept coming up cold. \n \n Then in the middle of last year, the courier had a telephone conversation with someone who was being monitored by U.S. intelligence, according to an American official, who like others interviewed for this story spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation. The courier was located somewhere away from bin Laden\'s hideout when he had the discussion, but it was enough to help intelligence officials locate and watch him. \n \n In August 2010, the courier unknowingly led authorities to a compound in the northeast Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where al-Libi had once lived. The walls surrounding the property were as high as 18 feet and topped with barbed wire. Intelligence officials had known about the house for years, but they always suspected that bin Laden would be surrounded by heavily armed security guards. Nobody patrolled the compound in Abbottabad. \n \n In fact, nobody came or went. And no telephone or Internet lines ran from the compound. The CIA soon believed that bin Laden was hiding in plain sight, in a hideout especially built to go unnoticed. But since bin Laden never traveled and nobody could get onto the compound without passing through two security gates, there was no way to be sure. \n \n Despite that uncertainty, intelligence officials realized this could represent the best chance ever to get to bin Laden. They decided not to share the information with anyone, including staunch counterterrorism allies such as Britain, Canada and Australia. \n \n By mid-February, the officials were convinced a ""high-value target"" was hiding in the compound. President Barack Obama wanted to take action. \n \n ""They were confident and their confidence was growing: \'This is different. This intelligence case is different. What we see in this compound is different than anything we\'ve ever seen before,\'"" John Brennan, the president\'s top counterterrorism adviser, said Monday. ""I was confident that we had the basis to take action."" \n \n Options were limited. The compound was in a residential neighborhood in a sovereign country. If Obama ordered an airstrike and bin Laden was not in the compound, it would be a huge diplomatic problem. Even if Obama was right, obliterating the compound might make it nearly impossible to confirm bin Laden\'s death. \n \n Said Brennan: ""The president had to evaluate the strength of that information, and then made what I believe was one of the most gutsiest calls of any president in recent memory."" \n \n Obama tapped two dozen members of the Navy\'s elite SEAL Team Six to carry out a raid with surgical accuracy. \n \n Before dawn Monday morning, a pair of helicopters left Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan. The choppers entered Pakistani airspace using sophisticated technology intended to evade that country\'s radar systems, a U.S. official said. \n \n Officially, it was a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S. doesn\'t kill unarmed people trying to surrender. But it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering, two U.S. officials said. \n \n The helicopters lowered into the compound, dropping the SEALs behind the walls. No shots were fired, but shortly after the team hit the ground, one of the helicopters came crashing down and rolled onto its side for reasons the government has yet to explain. None of the SEALs was injured, however, and the mission continued uninterrupted. \n \n With the CIA and White House monitoring the situation in real time – presumably by live satellite feed or video carried by the SEALs – the team stormed the compound. \n \n Thanks to sophisticated satellite monitoring, U.S. forces knew they\'d likely find bin Laden\'s family on the second and third floors of one of the buildings on the property, officials said. The SEALs secured the rest of the property first, then proceeded to the room where bin Laden was hiding. In the ensuing firefight, Brennan said, bin Laden used a woman as a human shield. \n \n The SEALs killed bin Laden with a bullet to the head. Using the call sign for his visual identification, one of the soldiers communicated that ""Geronimo"" had been killed in action, according to a U.S. official. \n \n Bin Laden\'s body was immediately identifiable, but the U.S. also conducted DNA testing that identified him with near 100 percent certainty, senior administration officials said. Photo analysis by the CIA, confirmation on site by a woman believed to be bin Laden\'s wife, and matching physical features such as bin Laden\'s height all helped confirm the identification. At the White House, there was no doubt. \n \n ""I think the accomplishment that very brave personnel from the United States government were able to realize yesterday is a defining moment in the war against al-Qaida, the war on terrorism, by decapitating the head of the snake known as al-Qaida,"" Brennan said. \n \n U.S. forces searched the compound and flew away with documents, hard drives and DVDs that could provide valuable intelligence about al-Qaida, a U.S. official said. The entire operation took about 40 minutes, officials said. \n \n Bin Laden\'s body was flown to the USS Carl Vinson in the North Arabian sea, a senior defense official said. There, aboard a U.S. warship, officials conducted a traditional Islamic burial ritual. Bin Laden\'s body was washed and placed in a white sheet. He was placed in a weighted bag that, after religious remarks by a military officer, was slipped into the sea about 2 a.m. EDT Monday. \n \n Said the president: ""I think we can all agree this is a good day for America."" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Kimberly Dozier, Eileen Sullivan and Ben Feller in Washington and Kathy Gannon in Islamabad, Pakistan contributed to this report.']",4,"– A CIA operative in charge of hunting down Osama bin Laden is a war profiteer who helped bilk the Pentagon out of some $200 million, reports Gawker.

141,"[""BOSTON (AP) — Boston's police commissioner says a 34-year-old homeless man with a violent history has been arrested in the stabbings of two city park rangers on Boston Common, the nation's oldest public park. \n \n Commissioner William Evans said Tuesday night that a 46-year-old ranger sergeant is in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital with life-threatening injuries. He said a 23-year-old ranger new to the service is in stable condition at Tufts Medical Center with less serious wounds. \n \n Evans said Bodio Hutchinson attacked the unarmed rangers in what the commissioner said was an unprovoked confrontation at about 4:30 p.m. Evans said witnesses followed the suspect and provided cellphone video to police. He said a knife police believe was used in the attack was recovered from Frog Pond. \n \n Evans said Hutchison faces attempted murder charges."", 'Investigators checked a trash can at Boston Common following the stabbing of two park rangers. \n \n A homeless man with a “violent criminal past” allegedly stabbed two Boston park rangers who approached him on Boston Common Tuesday, lunging at them in an unprovoked and wild attack that left one ranger in critical condition at Massachusetts General Hospital, police officials said. \n \n Boston police chased Bodio Hutchinson, 34, into the Public Garden, where they arrested him and fished a knife out of a nearby pond, officials said. Before officers tackled him to the pavement, witnesses said, Hutchinson told the officers to shoot him. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “Our prayers are with both of the rangers,” said Boston Police Commissioner William Evans at a press conference Tuesday night. “We have good witnesses and good video, and we’re confident in the suspect we have that’s responsible for this.” \n \n Authorities did not name the two men wounded but said the ranger who was critically hurt and taken to Mass. General is a 46-year-old sergeant who has been on the job for 20 years. He was stabbed in the abdomen and was in surgery on Tuesday night. The other ranger, authorities said, is 23 and had just joined the force. He suffered several wounds and was taken to Tufts Medical Center. \n \n Hutchinson was sitting on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument statue in the Common when the rangers, who were not armed, approached him, said Evans. \n \n Hutchinson “has a very violent, assaultive past history,” Evans said. “The officers confronted him up by the monument and without provocation he lunged at both officers,” \n \n Witnesses who rushed to the Common after hearing a commotion described a horrifying scene: two wounded rangers, one lying on a bench with his hands over his stomach to stanch the bleeding, the other walking nearby and holding his arm. \n \n Bill Mitchell for The Boston Globe Boston Police chased Bodio Hutchinson, 34, into the Public Garden, where they arrested him and fished a knife out of a nearby pond, officials said. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “We run up here, we see cops, just like, bleeding,” said Jackson Marchant, who was walking nearby when the stabbing occurred. “A lot of people were helping the cops. But he was stabbed right in the central stomach, and it was bloody, it was bleeding, his whole torso was covered in red. He was holding himself, praying.” \n \n The wounded ranger continued praying as he was loaded into an emergency vehicle, Marchant said. \n \n Officials said that as Hutchinson allegedly fled, some bystanders followed him, and videotaped him on their cellphones. \n \n Witnesses described a brief chase, with officers running after Hutchinson out of the Common and into the Public Garden, telling him to stop. Hutchinson was not moving very fast, witnesses said. \n \n “He stopped, and he told them to shoot him,” said Nicholas Rusk, 19. “They just tackled him to the ground.” \n \n One witness snapped a series of pictures of the arrest: In one, a heavyset man dressed in a Red Sox jacket and a pompom hat with “Boston” written on it is lying prone on the ground under two officers, his mouth slightly open. In another, the man stands in bright red shorts over black pants, surrounded by officers whom he appears to be addressing. Police declined to confirm that the pictures showed Hutchinson. \n \n Witnesses pointed police to the pond in the Public Garden, and officers waded in. Evans said they retrieved a knife. \n \n “I can’t say enough about the public,” said Evans. “Great work on the part of the public and on the part of the officers.” \n \n According to police, Hutchinson has an open warrant for his arrest on a charge of assault and battery on a police officer. He was arrested in February of last year and charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery, according to officials. \n \n Evans said it was not clear whether the rangers who approached Hutchinson knew of the outstanding warrant. \n \n Mayor Martin J. Walsh said that at any given time, two to four officers are patroling Boston Common and the Public Garden. \n \n “Certainly we’ve, on the Boston Common, had issues in the past with homelessness, but our officers work very hard in there,” said Walsh. “Generally they work without incident and are able to defuse any situation. In this incident clearly they were not able to defuse it when the gentleman attacked them.” \n \n Walsh said the parks commissioner will talk with rangers and police to see if they need more equipment or more manpower to keep the parks safe. \n \n On Tuesday evening, the monument was roped off with crime scene tape. The heavy police presence had drawn onlookers, many of whom expressed shock that rangers could be so brazenly attacked. Helicopters whirred overhead, and investigators canvassed the scene by flashlight, marking several spots as evidence. \n \n Evans said Hutchinson will probably face at least two counts of attempted murder, in addition to the outstanding charges of assaulting a police officer, and drug charges. \n \n “He’s not a newcomer to the criminal justice system,” said Evans.']",2,"– A Boston park ranger suffered life-threatening injuries after being stabbed on the Boston Common this afternoon, reports the Boston Globe. Another ranger was injured in the attack inside what the AP calls the nation's oldest public park. Police say a homeless man with a ""very violent, assaultive"" history lunged at the pair with a knife when they approached him as he sat by a statue. Authorities identified the suspect as Bodio Hutchinson, 34. The rangers haven't been identified. The more seriously injured one, who was stabbed in the abdomen, is 46. The other is 23.

John McCain’s war record. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Trump holds 18 percent support among Republicans in a CNN/ORC International Poll released Sunday morning. Jeb Bush follows in second place with 15 percent. \n \n Since a similar poll in late June, Trump’s support has risen 6 percentage points. \n \n “There's a movement going on, this is more than me,” Trump said while discussing the latest poll results Sunday morning on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “People are tired of these incompetent politicians in Washington I can't say I’m unhappy or anything, I'm just not that surprised.” \n \n The poll also found that most Republican voters want Donald Trump to remain in the GOP presidential race. \n \n Fifty two percent of registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents want the outspoken real estate magnate to stay in the race, according to the CNN/ORC poll. \n \n Thirty three percent want him to drop out, however, and 15 percent say he should run as an independent. \n \n Trump told The Hill in an exclusive interview last week that he would consider a third-party run if RNC leaders were unfair to him during the primary process. \n \n Among all respondents, 40 percent expect former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to be the Republican nominee. \n \n Eighteen percent think Trump will be the nominee and 11 percent think Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will emerge as the GOP nominee. \n \n Thirty one percent of Republicans, however, expect Bush to represent the party in 2016. Twenty two percent predicted Trump will be the nominee and 14 percent selected Walker. \n \n The poll of 1,017 adults was conducted between July 22 and 25th, after Trump mocked McCain’s time as a prisoner of war, drawing condemnation from a broad spectrum of Republicans. The poll has a 3.5 percentage point margin of error. \n \n --Sarah Ferris contributed to this report, which was updated at 11:41 a.m."", '(CNN) In the first national telephone poll since Donald Trump earned rebukes from Republican leaders over his comments about Senator John McCain\'s military service, the real estate mogul has increased his support among GOP voters and now stands atop the race for the party\'s nomination. \n \n The new CNN/ORC Poll finds Trump at 18% support among Republicans, with former Florida governor Jeb Bush just behind at 15%, within the poll\'s margin of error. \n \n They are joined at the top of the pack by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, with 10% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who are registered to vote. Trump\'s backing has climbed 6 points since a late-June poll, while support for Bush and Walker has not changed significantly. \n \n None of the other 14 candidates tested in the new CNN/ORC survey earned double-digit support. \n \n Though Trump currently tops the race for the nomination, his advantage is by no means firm. A majority of Republican voters, 51%, say they see the field as wide open, and that it\'s too soon to say which candidate they will ultimately get behind. Among that group that see the contest as wide open, Bush has 14% support, while Trump has the backing of 13% and Walker stands at 9%. \n \n Trump does much better among those Republicans who say they\'ve narrowed it down to one or two candidates, 24% of that group backs him, 16% Bush and 12% Walker. \n \n Trump\'s popularity among Republican voters does not translate to the broader pool of registered voters. When tested in hypothetical general election matchups against top Democrats, he trails both frontrunner Hillary Clinton and upstart Senator Bernie Sanders by wide margins. Bush and Walker run just behind Clinton and about even with Sanders. \n \n Trump\'s unfavorability rating is sky high. Overall, 59% of all registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, though that dips to 42% among GOP voters. \n \n None of the other Republicans landing near the top of the field have such a negative image nationwide, though many remain little known. \n \n Clinton is the only candidate who is about as well-known as Trump, and while she is more well-liked than the developer, her favorability rating is net negative among registered voters nationally: 49% have an unfavorable view while 44% have a positive impression. \n \n Still, the poll suggests Republican voters haven\'t yet had their fill of Trump. A majority (52%) say they\'d like to see Trump continue his run for the GOP nomination, including nearly six in 10 conservatives, tea party supporters and white evangelicals. Even among those Republican voters who support someone other than Trump, 42% say they\'d like him to remain in the field. \n \n The Republican electorate is more enthusiastic about next year\'s vote than the Democrats are. The poll finds 46% of Democratic voters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president next year, compared with 55% of Republican voters. But enthusiasm is down in both parties compared with June of 2011, when 61% of Republican registered voters and 55% of Democratic registered voters were that enthusiastic. \n \n In another positive sign for Trump\'s candidacy, among those Republicans who are enthusiastic about voting next year, Trump holds a larger edge over his competition: 22% say they would back him for their party\'s nomination, compared with 14% who back Bush and 12% behind Walker. \n \n Overall, about three-quarters of Republicans are satisfied with their choices, more so than in 2011 at this time (about two-thirds were satisfied then), but still, just 23% say they are ""very satisfied"" with the field. \n \n Meanwhile, an NBC News/Marist poll on Sunday showed Trump leading among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and narrowly trailing Walker in Iowa. \n \n Trump took 21% of the New Hampshire GOP primary vote, with Bush running second at 14%, while in Iowa Trump was at 17% and Walker at 19%, according to the NBC/Marist survey \n \n On the Democratic side, the CNN poll found Clinton remains the clear frontrunner, though Sanders has increased his support slightly since last month\'s poll. Clinton is backed by 56% of registered Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, while Sanders has inched up to 19% from 15% in June. The rest of the field is about even with where they were before. \n \n The CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted July 22-25 among a random national sample of 1,017 adults, including 898 registered voters. Results for all registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The registered voter sample included 419 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents as well as 392 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.']",2,"– Some media outlets might want to evict Donald Trump from their politics sections, but he appears to be doing pretty well among Americans surveying the political arena. As CNN reports in a new CNN/ORC national poll, Trump is polling at the top of the considerable heap of Republican presidential contenders, at 18%. Jeb Bush comes in second at 15%, Scott Walker at 10%, and no other GOP candidate cracked double digits. Of note: The poll was conducted after Trump started swinging at John McCain's war record, indicating he's emerged unscathed; the new poll puts Trump up 6 points over a similar poll at the end of June. ""There's a movement going on,"" Trump told CNN this morning in response, per the Hill. ""People are tired of these incompetent politicians in Washington ... I'm just not that surprised."" Trump is racking up similar numbers in Iowa, per an NBC/Marist poll out today: He's at 17%, though he's trailing Walker's 19% in that state, reports Politico. Bush has 12% there. The story is a little more marked in New Hampshire, where Trump is pulling down 21% to Bush's 14% and Walker's 12%. And Trump's divisiveness shows in his unfavorability ratings: 53% of New Hampshire Republicans view him unfavorably, notes Politico, while that number is 44% in Iowa, and what CNN calls a ""sky high"" 59% of all registered voters in its poll."
143,"['Madrid (CNN) -- Flanked by his family and before Spain\'s Parliament, Felipe VI was formally proclaimed the new King of Spain Thursday, following the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos. \n \n The new King, clad in military uniform, promised to head a changed monarchy ""for new times,"" in an address before the packed parliamentary chamber. \n \n ""We have a great country, we are a great nation -- let us trust in it,"" he told the packed parliamentary chamber and the millions watching nationwide. \n \n After swearing an oath promising to uphold the constitution, the new monarch expressed his respect for the Parliament and the nation -- as well as his own emotion at becoming monarch. \n \n Felipe paid tribute to his father\'s ""extraordinary"" legacy over nearly four decades, including his leadership as the country returned to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. \n \n He also thanked his mother, Queen Sofia, for a lifetime of hard work and devotion to the Spanish people. \n \n Felipe spoke of the need for a monarch to unify his country and to work with its political leaders, a message with added significance at a time when many in the country\'s Catalonia region want a referendum on independence. \n \n He also vowed to carry out his duties, remain loyal to his nation and work for the interests of Spain. ""I will honor the pledge and the oath I have just taken,"" he said. \n \n The head of state must set an example of honest and transparent behavior, he said, perhaps a reflection of the scandals that have beset the monarchy in recent times. \n \n Felipe reflected on the country\'s recent economic woes, which have fueled high unemployment rates. But he also spoke of the need for its people, at a time of adversity, to ""look ahead to the Spain we are building together as I begin this reign."" \n \n This, he said, will mean modernizing to meet the challenges of a globalized world. \n \n The proclamation ceremony is a more subdued affair than a coronation, without the pomp of foreign dignitaries and elaborate ceremonies. \n \n But crowds cheered loudly as Felipe, his wife, now Queen Letizia, and their two daughters emerged onto the balcony of the royal palace, joined by Juan Carlos and Sofia, to salute the Spanish people. \n \n Chants of ""Long live the king"" rang out in Spanish. \n \n Felipe\'s elder daughter, Leonor, 8, becomes Princess of Asturias, first in line to the throne. \n \n Retirements of monarchs \n \n Stroke of pen \n \n His father\'s 39-year reign had come to an end with the stroke of a pen and the stroke of midnight Wednesday. \n \n Less than three weeks after he announced his surprise abdication, longtime leader Juan Carlos signed the step into law at the royal palace in Madrid, making his son the new king. \n \n In another ceremony held Thursday morning to mark the transfer of power, Juan Carlos took off the red sash signifying his role as head of Spain\'s military, fastening it around his son\'s waist. \n \n Crowds lined up waving the red and yellow Spanish flags as military bands marched in the streets of Madrid. \n \n Juan Carlos has said Felipe, a former Olympic yachtsman, has ""the maturity, the preparation and the sense of responsibility necessary"" to serve as king and ""to lead to a new stage of hope using his experience and the drive of a new generation."" \n \n The new King is regarded as being untouched by the accusations of corruption and excess that have plagued the royal family as many Spaniards continue to struggle to find jobs and pull themselves out of financial ruin. \n \n At his side will be the new Queen Letizia, who before she married into the royal family worked as a TV presenter. \n \n Princess Cristina, the new King\'s older sister, is embroiled in a tax fraud and money-laundering investigation. She and her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, have denied allegations that they diverted public funds from Urdangarin\'s foundation for private use. \n \n Spaniards have long held Juan Carlos, 76, in high regard for shepherding the country into democracy. \n \n But his popularity took a hit in 2012 over a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Africa while the nation was mired in a deep economic crisis. \n \n Some Spaniards have called for the monarchy to be abandoned, favoring the establishment of a republic instead. \n \n The anti-monarchy movement has been fueled by the scandals that have hit the royal family in recent years. \n \n The biggest task for Felipe, 46, will be to make the dealings of the royal palace more transparent. His family has a relatively austere reputation compared with other European monarchies, but there has been increasing resentment in Spain over the cost of the royal family to the public. \n \n READ: The sailor who will take the helm in Spain \n \n CNN\'s Al Goodman reported from Madrid, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London and Steve Almasy in Atlanta.', 'MADRID (AP) — Crown Prince Felipe ascended to the Spanish throne at midnight Wednesday, but there weren\'t any ritzy official celebrations. \n \n Spain’s King Juan Carlos, 2nd left is kissed by Queen Sofia, left in the presence of Spain\'s Crown Prince Felipe, 3rd left and Princess Letizia after he signed an abdication law during a ceremony at the...

Spain’s Juan Carlos formally ratified... (Associated Press) \n \n The economic crisis that has left a quarter of Spaniards out of work prompted Europe\'s newest king to be relatively frugal at his proclamation. \n \n The crown prince\'s father, 76-year-old Juan Carlos, misjudged public anger at financial hardship when he went on an elephant-hunting safari in Africa. Felipe, 46, appears keen to show he\'s more in tune with his countrymen — and avoid the mistakes of his abdicating predecessor. \n \n The landmark occasion was perhaps most notable for what it didn\'t include: no state banquet, no foreign royals or heads of state, no ostentatious ceremonies or parades. \n \n By royal standards, it was humble: reception guests were being served hot and cold tapas-style nibbles, to be eaten while standing. There was no champagne, just sparkling cava wine from Spain\'s Catalonia region. \n \n ""More than anything this is a message. What they want to say is: \'We\'re in a moment when sobriety in spending shows a certain sense of solidarity in a time of economic difficulty,\'"" Navarra University history professor Pablo Perez Lopez said. \n \n Juan Carlos on Wednesday signed legislation, approved by Parliament earlier this month, setting out the legal framework for the handover. The retiring monarch, who underwent a hip replacement operation last November, used a walking cane and moved with difficulty during the televised signing ceremony. \n \n Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy immediately ratified the law, which went into force at midnight in Spain (2200 GMT). \n \n Felipe is to be formally proclaimed monarch and swear an oath at a ceremony with lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday. It will be a no-frills event, though the 18th-century Spanish crown and 17th-century scepter will be on display. \n \n After a brief military parade, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia will take a drive through expected crowds along some of Madrid\'s most emblematic streets and monuments — such as the Prado Museum and the Cibeles fountain. \n \n The palace acknowledged that the customary pomp had been eliminated ""in keeping with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend."" \n \n The reasoning behind that choice is easy to understand, says Emilio de Diego Garcia, history professor at Madrid\'s Complutense University. \n \n ""In a time when every expense is examined with a magnifying glass, particularly public money, any ostentation would have been criticized,"" he said. \n \n Juan Carlos announced his surprise decision to abdicate on June 2, saying he was stepping aside after a four-decade reign to allow for younger royal blood to rally the country that is still trying to shrug off a double-dip recession and a 26 percent jobless rate. \n \n During most of his reign, the monarch was held in high esteem for his role in helping steer the country from military dictatorship to democracy. He took over the throne in 1975, two days after the death of longtime dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, and then endeared himself to many by making army rebels stand down during an attempted military coup in 1981. \n \n More recently, however, the royal family\'s image was tarnished by Juan Carlos\' 2012 Botswana hunting trip. Another scandal saw Juan Carlos\' youngest daughter, Princess Cristina, testify this year in the fraud and money-laundering case engulfing her husband, the Olympic handball medalist turned businessman Inaki Urdangarin. \n \n Juan Carlos won broad support for his handling of Spain\'s 20th-century challenges. Felipe VI must now address Spain\'s 21st-century difficulties. \n \n Keeping the bill down for taxpayers is just one of the challenges facing the new king. \n \n Much more pressing will be whether he can keep the country united as separatist movements, such as those in Catalonia and the Basque region, try to pull the country apart. Such an unraveling could place the monarchy itself in danger. \n \n The abdication announcement initially triggered widespread demonstrations calling for a referendum on reinstating a republic. But a recent poll found that while 62 percent of respondents said they wanted a referendum on the monarchy ""at some point,"" 49 percent said they favored a monarchy with Felipe as king, while only 36 percent wanted a republic. Others did not answer or expressed no opinion. \n \n Felipe holds a law degree from Madrid\'s Autonomous University and obtained a master\'s in international relations from Georgetown University in Washington. His wife is a former television journalist and a divorced commoner. Many people feel that record will help make Felipe more attuned to the public mood. \n \n Diego Garcia, the Complutense professor, believes Spain is going to see ""a more austere monarchy, one closer to the people and the reality of the country."" \n \n The 2,000 guests invited to the royal reception were from a wide range of Spanish society, including Madrid ambassadors as well as representatives from the business, cultural, media and sports sectors. \n \n Authorities have prohibited a planned demonstration in Madrid on Thursday by people demanding an end to the monarchy. \n \n The palace said it had no information on the overall cost of the events, which will be overseen by some 7,000 police. \n \n ____ \n \n Hatton contributed from Lisbon, Portugal.']",2,"– Spain's Prince Felipe became King Felipe VI at midnight as the abdication of his father, King Juan Carlos, became official. The occasion was fairly low-key, with no foreign heads of state present and no huge state banquet, which the palace says was ""in keeping with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend,"" the AP reports. The 46-year-old king was later proclaimed head of state in a parliamentary ceremony where he promised to be a monarch ""who is ready listen and understand, warn and advise as well as to defend the public interest at all times,"" the BBC reports. The new king spoke of the need to ""look ahead to the Spain we are building together as I begin this reign,"" reports CNN, which notes that while the monarchy remains popular in Spain, the royal family has been accused of corruption and excess during the country's economic crisis—and Juan Carlos' image suffered after he went on a luxurious elephant-hunting trip in the middle of the recession. Felipe and his wife, who is now Queen Letizia, will be driven through the streets of Madrid before appearing at the palace but they may find that many Spaniards aren't in the mood for cheering: The country's soccer team, which won the World Cup in 2010, crashed out of the tournament last night with a 2-0 loss to Chile."

Watch the update here. \n \n PREVIOUSLY: \n \n Obituaries are published in newspapers every day, but you\'ve probably never read one like the one you\'re about to read. \n \n Friday, the Cherokee Scout in Murphy, North Carolina posted an obituary for Cornelia June Rogers Miller. \n \n \n \n She lived in Florida, but had a summer home in Murphy - a small town where the views are breathtaking. \n \n June and her husband visited often. \n \n ""Once my father retired, they would go up to Murphy pretty much whenever they liked to. They would go for a weekend in the winter,"" said Robert Miller, June\'s oldest son. \n \n Miller says it wasn\'t until last year that his father had to sell the summer home in Murphy. It was becoming too much for the couple to make the drive from Florida. \n \n Eventually, they both ended up in an assisted living facility. \n \n ""He was actually her roommate at the facility,"" Miller told NewsChannel 9. \n \n According to the obituary in the Cherokee Scout, June died in February. \n \n ""She was 82 years old, I believe, so she had a variety of complications,"" Miller explained when we asked how she passed. \n \n It wasn\'t until last week though, nearly four months after her death, that the obituary showed up in the paper. \n \n Part of it reads: ""There will be no service, no prayers, and no closure for the family she spent a lifetime tearing apart."" \n \n We sent it to June\'s son. \n \n ""The whole thing is just sad,"" Miller said. \n \n \n \n It most obituaries, you find a message honoring a person\'s life.

""Yeah, it\'s disturbing,"" said one man. \n \n So, who wrote the obituary about June? We still don\'t know. \n \n But, June\'s son Robert has an idea. \n \n ""It\'s unbelievable that my sisters would write this,"" he said. \n \n We tracked down one of his sisters, but she says she didn\'t write it either. \n \n She called the obituary very tragic and very sad. \n \n \n \n ""It\'s really sad that they don\'t have anything better to do,"" Miller added. \n \n Robert just hopes the memories his father and mother shared in Murphy won\'t ever be forgotten, and wants his mother to be remembered as a loving, generous woman. \n \n Miller tells us he sent a new obit to the paper that will run next week. \n \n We wanted to know if the Cherokee Scout considered rejecting the obituary. When we asked, publisher David Brown said, ""the family\'s will overrode the editor."" \n \n Brown told us the paper does look through each obituary and they feel they should only edit something if there is a very compelling reason to do so. \n \n Brown wouldn\'t say who sent the original obituary in.']",2,"– In the Deep South, a predilection for proper manners often means the temptation to tell someone off is replaced with a ""Bless your heart.""

""Drugs were a major love in her life as June had no hobbies, made no contribution to society, and rarely shared a kind word or deed in her life,"" the obituary says. ""We speak for the majority of her family when we say her presence will not be missed by many, very few tears will be shed, and there will be no lamenting over her passing."" All of which has her son, Robert Miller, fuming—and he thinks he knows who placed the obituary. ""It's unbelievable that my sisters would write this,"" he tells WTVC, noting his mom was a ""loving, generous woman."" WTVC managed to track down one of his two sisters, and she tells the station she didn't write the obituary, calling it ""tragic."" To make matters worse, it appears parts of the obituary may have been plagiarized from one written for someone in California in 2008. ""[She] doesn't even have the integrity to write something for herself,"" Miller says, apparently referring to the sister he thinks trashed their mom. The Cherokee Scout publisher says the paper scans all submitted obituaries but notes they won't change anything unless there's a solid reason. ""The family's will overrode the editor,"" he says. Miller says he sent in a new obituary to replace the printed one. (It's not the first scathing obituary.)"

We\'re grateful for the opportunity to share much of collection through the use of the Internet."" \n \n The church\'s campaign seems aimed at preventing current members from leaving and showing non-Mormons the faith has nothing to hide, said Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion and the James Bostwick chair of English at the University of Richmond. \n \n As an American-born religion much younger than most world religions, the origins of Mormonism have come under greater scrutiny and put pressure on the church to prove its stories, Givens said. \n \n ""The other churches\' origins are concealed by the mist of history,"" Givens said. ""Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists and newspaper reporting."" \n \n The pictures in the new book show different angles of a stone that is dark brown with lighter brown swirls. The photos also show a weathered leather pouch where the stone was stored that is believed to be made by one of Joseph Smith\'s wives, Emma Smith. \n \n The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during Mormon pioneers\' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s. But it decided to publish the photos to allow people who prefer visuals to words to better understand the religion\'s roots, said Richard Turley, assistant church historian. The stone will remain in the vault. \n \n ""The picture brings a kind of tangibility to something that has been previously been talked about just in words,"" Turley said. ""That helps people connect with the past."" \n \n Mormons believe that 185 years ago, Smith found gold plates engraved with writing in ancient Egyptian in upstate New York. They say God helped him translate the text using the stone and other tools, and it became known as the Book of Mormon. \n \n The manuscript in the new book belongs to the Community of Christ, a faith that was created by early Mormons who stayed behind when most members of the religion moved west to Utah. A Community of Christ leader joined LDS officials at the press event Tuesday in what both said demonstrated the two faiths have moved on from past squabbles. \n \n The church has been releasing books containing historical documents that shed light on how Smith formed the faith. It also has issued a series of in-depth articles that explain or clarify some of the more sensitive parts of the religion\'s history that it once sidestepped, such as its past ban on black men in the lay clergy and its early history of polygamy. \n \n The church paid a price for its past decisions to stay silent on topics or keep key artifacts in the vault, said Richard Bushman, a Mormon historian and emeritus professor at Columbia University. \n \n ""Their faithful members would stumble on information on the Internet. Not having heard about them, they were shocked and disillusioned,"" Bushman said. \n \n Today the church is taking a new approach by saying, ""We can face up to the facts. We don\'t have to make the picture prettier than it is,"" he said.', 'He dictated the narrative to various scribes, including schoolteacher Oliver Cowdery, who took down the LDS leader\'s words in longhand. Cowdery then painstakingly copied the original manuscript for the printer to set in type. More than 70 percent of that original document suffered water damage. The LDS Church History Library in Salt Lake City has most of what\'s left. \n \n The ""printer\'s copy,"" however, remained with Smith\'s followers who stayed in the Midwest rather than trekking to Utah, and, in 1903, it was purchased by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now the Community of Christ. \n \n Through the years, tensions simmered between those two wings of Mormonism. But, during the past couple of decades, historians have built scholarly bridges between the Community of Christ and the much-larger, Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \n \n Community of Christ officials have been ""careful stewards of the manuscript,"" Snow said Tuesday. ""Both faiths are trying to move forward in sharing their collections."" \n \n Community of Christ minister and Seventy Robin Linkhart, who was at the news conference, praised her Utah colleagues for their part in the joint project. \n \n The two-volume work, Linkhart said, ""truly is an exceptional contribution to the study of LDS history and culture, representing decades of research."" \n \n Begun by Mormon scholar Royal Skousen in 1988, she said, ""it\'s been a long, long journey to the finish line."" \n \n The Community of Christ long ago accepted the notion that ""revelation includes a human component,"" said Lachlan Mackay, coordinator of the denomination\'s historic sites. \n \n The Independence, Mo.-based faith published articles about the seer stone as early as the 1960s, he said, but ""it might still be news to some people."" \n \n ""I\'m incredibly excited,"" Mackay said Tuesday. ""These efforts have served to unite us."" \n \n Both he and Richard E. Turley Jr., assistant LDS historian, said physical objects ""help us connect to the past, make it more realistic, more tangible."" \n \n In a recent essay, the LDS Church explained how Smith, according to some accounts, used the seer stone. He peered into a hat, to block out exterior light, and ""read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument."" \n \n ""As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure,"" the essay said. ""As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture."" \n \n Smith also used two bound stones — known as the Urim and Thummim — as ""interpreters."" \n \n ""Some accounts indicate that Joseph studied the characters on the plates,"" the essay added. ""Most of the accounts speak of Joseph\'s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone).""', ""Joseph Smith said that the Book of Mormon was “the most correct of any Book on earth & the keystone of our religion & a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other Book.” 1 The Book of Mormon came into the world through a series of miraculous events. Much can be known about the coming forth of the English text of the Book of Mormon through a careful study of statements made by Joseph Smith, his scribes, and others closely associated with the translation of the Book of Mormon. \n \n “By the Gift and Power of God” \n \n Joseph Smith reported that on the evening of September 21, 1823, while he prayed in the upper room of his parents’ small log home in Palmyra, New York, an angel who called himself Moroni appeared and told Joseph that “God had a work for [you] to do.”2 He informed Joseph that “there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.” The book could be found in a hill not far from the Smith family farm. This was no ordinary history, for it contained “the fullness of the everlasting Gospel as delivered by the Savior.”3 \n \n The angel charged Joseph Smith to translate the book from the ancient language in which it was written. The young man, however, had very little formal education and was incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language, known in the Book of Mormon as “reformed Egyptian.”4 Joseph’s wife Emma insisted that, at the time of translation, Joseph “could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon.”5 \n \n Joseph received the plates in September 1827 and the following spring, in Harmony, Pennsylvania, began translating them in earnest, with Emma and his friend Martin Harris serving as his main scribes. The resulting English transcription, known as the Book of Lehi and referred to by Joseph Smith as written on 116 pages, was subsequently lost or stolen. As a result, Joseph Smith was rebuked by the Lord and lost the ability to translate for a short time.6 \n \n Joseph began translating again in 1829, and almost all of the present Book of Mormon text was translated during a three-month period between April and June of that year. His chief scribe during these months was Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher from Vermont who learned about the Book of Mormon while boarding with Joseph’s parents in Palmyra. Called by God in a vision, Cowdery traveled to Harmony to meet Joseph Smith and investigate further. Of his experience as scribe, Cowdery wrote, “These were days never to be forgotten—to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven.”7 \n \n The manuscript that Joseph Smith dictated to Oliver Cowdery and others is known today as the original manuscript, about 28 percent of which still survives.8 This manuscript corroborates Joseph Smith’s statements that the manuscript was written within a short time frame and that it was dictated from another language. For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript.9 In addition, some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript, suggesting that the base language of the translation was not English.10 \n \n Unlike most dictated drafts, the original manuscript was considered by Joseph Smith to be, in substance, a final product. To assist in the publication of the book, Oliver Cowdery made a handwritten copy of the original manuscript. This copy is known today as the printer’s manuscript. Because Joseph Smith did not call for punctuation, such as periods, commas, or question marks as he dictated, such marks are not in the original manuscript. The typesetter later inserted punctuation marks when he prepared the text for the printer.11 With the exceptions of punctuation, formatting, other elements of typesetting, and minor adjustments required to correct copying and scribal errors, the dictation copy became the text of the first printed edition of the book.12 \n \n Translation Instruments \n \n Many accounts in the Bible show that God transmitted revelations to His prophets in a variety of ways. Elijah learned that God spoke not to him through the wind or fire or earthquake but through a “still small voice.”13 Paul and other early apostles sometimes communicated with angels and, on occasion, with the Lord Jesus Christ.14 At other times, revelation came in the form of dreams or visions, such as the revelation to Peter to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, or through sacred objects like the Urim and Thummim.15 \n \n Joseph Smith stands out among God’s prophets, because he was called to render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages, containing doctrine that would deepen and expand the theological understanding of millions of people. For this monumental task, God prepared additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments. \n \n Joseph Smith and his scribes wrote of two instruments used in translating the Book of Mormon. According to witnesses of the translation, when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English. One instrument, called in the Book of Mormon the “interpreters,” is better known to Latter-day Saints today as the “Urim and Thummim.” Joseph found the interpreters buried in the hill with the plates.16 Those who saw the interpreters described them as a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim. The Book of Mormon referred to this instrument, together with its breastplate, as a device “kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord” and “handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages.”17 \n \n The other instrument, which Joseph Smith discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates, was a small oval stone, or “seer stone.”18 As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure.19 As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture.20 \n \n Apparently for convenience, Joseph often translated with the single seer stone rather than the two stones bound together to form the interpreters. These two instruments—the interpreters and the seer stone—were apparently interchangeable and worked in much the same way such that, in the course of time, Joseph Smith and his associates often used the term “Urim and Thummim” to refer to the single stone as well as the interpreters.21 In ancient times, Israelite priests used the Urim and Thummim to assist in receiving divine communications. Although commentators differ on the nature of the instrument, several ancient sources state that the instrument involved stones that lit up or were divinely illumined.22 Latter-day Saints later understood the term “Urim and Thummim” to refer exclusively to the interpreters. Joseph Smith and others, however, seem to have understood the term more as a descriptive category of instruments for obtaining divine revelations and less as the name of a specific instrument. \n \n Some people have balked at this claim of physical instruments used in the divine translation process, but such aids to facilitate the communication of God’s power and inspiration are consistent with accounts in scripture. In addition to the Urim and Thummim, the Bible mentions other physical instruments used to access God’s power: the rod of Aaron, a brass serpent, holy anointing oils, the Ark of the Covenant, and even dirt from the ground mixed with saliva to heal the eyes of a blind man.23 \n \n The Mechanics of Translation \n \n In the preface to the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith wrote: “I would inform you that I translated [the book], by the gift and power of God.” When pressed for specifics about the process of translation, Joseph repeated on several occasions that it had been done “by the gift and power of God”24 and once added, “It was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the book of Mormon.”25 \n \n Nevertheless, the scribes and others who observed the translation left numerous accounts that give insight into the process. Some accounts indicate that Joseph studied the characters on the plates. Most of the accounts speak of Joseph’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone), and many accounts refer to his use of a single stone. According to these accounts, Joseph placed either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.26 The process as described brings to mind a passage from the Book of Mormon that speaks of God preparing “a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light.”27 \n \n The scribes who assisted with the translation unquestionably believed that Joseph translated by divine power. Joseph’s wife Emma explained that she “frequently wrote day after day” at a small table in their house in Harmony, Pennsylvania. She described Joseph “sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us.”28 According to Emma, the plates “often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth.” When asked if Joseph had dictated from the Bible or from a manuscript he had prepared earlier, Emma flatly denied those possibilities: “He had neither manuscript nor book to read from.” Emma told her son Joseph Smith III, “The Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity—I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me for hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him.”29 \n \n Another scribe, Martin Harris sat across the table from Joseph Smith and wrote down the words Joseph dictated. Harris later related that as Joseph used the seer stone to translate, sentences appeared. Joseph read those sentences aloud, and after penning the words, Harris would say, “Written.” An associate who interviewed Harris recorded him saying that Joseph “possessed a seer stone, by which he was enabled to translate as well as from the Urim and Thummim, and for convenience he then used the seer stone.”30 \n \n The principal scribe, Oliver Cowdery, testified under oath in 1831 that Joseph Smith “found with the plates, from which he translated his book, two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows. That by looking through these, he was able to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates.”31 In the fall of 1830, Cowdery visited Union Village, Ohio, and spoke about the translation of the Book of Mormon. Soon thereafter, a village resident reported that the translation was accomplished by means of “two transparent stones in the form of spectacles thro which the translator looked on the engraving.”32 \n \n Conclusion \n \n Joseph Smith consistently testified that he translated the Book of Mormon by the “gift and power of God.” His scribes shared that testimony. The angel who brought news of an ancient record on metal plates buried in a hillside and the divine instruments prepared especially for Joseph Smith to translate were all part of what Joseph and his scribes viewed as the miracle of translation. When he sat down in 1832 to write his own history for the first time, he began by promising to include “an account of his marvelous experience.”33 The translation of the Book of Mormon was truly marvelous. \n \n The truth of the Book of Mormon and its divine source can be known today. God invites each of us to read the book, remember the mercies of the Lord and ponder them in our hearts, “and ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true.” God promises that “if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.”34 \n \n Resources \n \n Wilford Woodruff journal, Nov. 28, 1841, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.

For example, when Joseph translated the text that is now in 1 Nephi 13:29, the scribe wrote “&” in one place where he should have written “an.” At 1 Nephi 17:48, the scribe wrote “weed” where he should have written “reed.” (See Royal Skousen, “Translating the Book of Mormon: Evidence from the Original Manuscript,” in Noel B.

Some grammatical constructions that sound odd to English speakers were edited out of later editions of the Book of Mormon by Joseph Smith or others in order to render the translation into more standard current English. See Richard E. Turley Jr. and William W. Slaughter, How We Got the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2011), 44–45. Approximately five-sixth of the 1830 first edition of the Book of Mormon was typeset from the printer’s manuscript. The other one-sixth was typeset from the original manuscript.

Joseph Smith seems to have used the terms “interpreters” and “spectacles” interchangeably during the early years of the Church. Nancy Towle, an itinerant Methodist preacher, recounted Joseph Smith telling her about “a pair of ‘interpreters,’ (as he called them,) that resembled spectacles, by looking into which, he could read a writing engraven upon the plates, though to himself, in a tongue unknown” (Nancy Towle, Vicissitudes Illustrated in the Experience of Nancy Towle, in Europe and America [Charleston: James L. Burges, 1832], 138–39.) Joseph’s 1832 history referred to “spectacles.” (Joseph Smith History, ca. summer 1832, in Joseph Smith Histories, 16.) In January 1833, the Latter-day Saint newspaper The Evening and the Morning Star, edited by William W. Phelps, equated “spectacles” and “interpreters” with the term “Urim and Thummim”: the Book of Mormon “was translated by the gift and power of God, by an unlearned man, through the aid of a pair of Interpreters, or spectacles— (known, perhaps, in ancient days as Teraphim, or Urim and Thummim).” (“The Book of Mormon,” The Evening and the Morning Star, January 1833, [2].) By 1835 Joseph Smith most often used the term “Urim and Thummim” when speaking of translation and rarely, if ever, used the terms “interpreters” or “spectacles.” (Joseph Smith, Journal, Nov. 9–11, 1835, in Journals: Volume 1: 1832–1839, 89; Joseph Smith, History, 1834–1836, in Davidson et al., Histories, Volume 1, 116; John W. Welch, “The Miraculous Translation of the Book of Mormon,” in John W. Welch, ed., with Erick B. Carlson, Opening the Heavens: Accounts of Divine Manifestations, 1820–1844 [Provo, UT, and Salt Lake City: Brigham Young University Press and Deseret Book, 2005], 123–28.) Joseph Smith probably possessed more than one seer stone; he appears to have found one of the stones while digging for a well around 1822. (Richard L. Bushman, Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1984], 69–70.) According to Martin Harris, an angel commanded Joseph Smith to stop these activities, which he did by 1826. (See Bushman, Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism, 64–76; and Richard Lloyd Anderson, “The Mature Joseph Smith and Treasure Searching,” BYU Studies 24, no. 4 [Fall 1984]: 489–560.) Joseph did not hide his well-known early involvement in treasure seeking. In 1838, he published responses to questions frequently asked of him. “Was not Jo Smith a money digger,” one question read. “Yes,” Joseph answered, “but it was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.” (Selections from Elders’ Journal, July 1838, 43, available at josephsmithpapers.org.) For the broader cultural context, see Alan Taylor, “The Early Republic’s Supernatural Economy: Treasure Seeking in the American Northeast, 1780–1830,” American Quarterly 38, no. 1 (Spring 1986): 6–33. Mark Ashurst-McGee, “A Pathway to Prophethood: Joseph Smith Junior as Rodsman, Village Seer, and Judeo-Christian Prophet” (Master's Thesis, Utah State University, 2000). For example, when Joseph Smith showed a seer stone to Wilford Woodruff in late 1841, Woodruff recorded in his journal: “I had the privilege of seeing for the first time in my day the URIM & THUMMIM.” (Wilford Woodruff journal, Dec. 27, 1841, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.)

Virtually all of the accounts of the translation process are reproduced in Welch, “Miraculous Translation.” Two accounts of the translation process, including the use of a seer stone, have been written by members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and published in Church magazines. Historians have also written about the seer stone in Church publications, both in the Ensign and in The Joseph Smith Papers. (See Neal A. Maxwell, “‘By the Gift and Power of God,’” Ensign, Jan. 1997, 36–41; Russell M.

A Palmyra newspaper published the earliest known account of the translation in August 1829: Jonathan Hadley, a Palmyra printer who may have spoken with Joseph Smith about translation, claimed that the plates were found with a “huge pair of Spectacles,” and that “by placing the Spectacles in a hat, and looking into it, Smith could (he said so, at least,) interpret these characters.” (“Golden Bible,” Palmyra Freeman, Aug. 11, 1829, [2].) In the winter of 1831, a Shaker in Union Village, Ohio, spoke of “two transparent stones in the form of spectacles” through which the translator “looked on the engraving & afterwards put his face into a hat & the interpretation then flowed into his mind.” (Christian Goodwillie, “Shaker Richard McNemar: The Earliest Book of Mormon Reviewer,” Journal of Mormon History 37, no. 2 [Spring 2011]: 143.) “Last Testimony of Sister Emma,” 289–90. “One of the Three Witnesses,” Deseret Evening News, Dec. 13, 1881, 4.

Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles pointed out in a 1997 Ensign article (“By the Gift and Power of God”) that this might have been intentional. \n \n “Perhaps the Lord wanted to leave the Book of Mormon in the realm of faith, though it is drenched with intrinsic evidence,” he wrote. \n \n Elder Maxwell indicated, however, that there is value in learning more about the Prophet Joseph, the translation process and those who assisted. \n \n “Our primary focus in studying the Book of Mormon should be on the principles of the gospel anyway, not on the process by which the book came forth,” Elder Maxwell wrote. “Yet because its coming so amply fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy of a ‘marvellous work and a wonder,’ we may find strengthened faith in considering how marvelous and wondrous the translation really was.” \n \n \'By the gift and power of God\' \n \n Among those who have wondered about the specific details of the Book of Mormon\'s translation was Hyrum Smith, an older brother of the Prophet Joseph. \n \n According to “History of the Church,” Joseph responded to his brother\'s curiosity by saying that “it was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon” and “it was not expedient for him to relate these things.” \n \n “Thus what we do know about the actual coming forth of the Book of Mormon is adequate, but it is not comprehensive,” Elder Maxwell wrote. \n \n Robin Jensen, associate managing historian and project archivist for the Joseph Smith Papers, said in an interview with the Deseret News that because the Prophet Joseph didn’t leave a detailed account of the translation process, historians and members of the church must rely on the reminiscences of scribes and those who witnessed the translation in order to understand the mechanics. \n \n Jensen said that in his studying of the process, he has come to see the translation as a “development” with multiple “different phases” in which Joseph “grew and developed and better understood his role.” \n \n It was a “monumental task” as Joseph was asked to “render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages,” the lds.org topic page states. So “God prepared additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments” to aid in the different phases of the translation process. \n \n “The Book of Mormon tells us the way is prepared for this record to be translated, and that’s a very physical, very mechanical process, much more so than we perhaps might envision that,” Jensen said. \n \n The topic page refers specifically to two types of instruments. The first, known as the Urim and Thummim, was “a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim” that was found in the Hill Cumorah with the gold plates. \n \n “The Book of Mormon referred to this instrument, together with its breastplate, as a device ‘kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord’ and ‘handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages,’” the topic page states. \n \n The second, known as a seer stone, was a “small oval stone” that Joseph “discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates,” according to the lds.org topic page, that he later learned could be used in the translation process. Jensen said the idea of seer stones was common during Joseph’s time. They were seen as “a way to confront the spiritual, supernatural world.” \n \n Witnesses of the translation process recorded that “when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English,” according to the topic page. \n \n Joseph was in his early 20s at the time and had “very little formal education and was incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language,” according to the topic page. \n \n Joseph repeatedly testified that it was “by the gift and power of God” that he was able to complete the translation, a fact his wife, Emma, affirmed. \n \n “The Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity — I have not the slightest doubt of it,” Emma told their son Joseph III on one occasion. “I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me for hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him.” \n \n The topic page also asserts the idea that the original Book of Mormon manuscript, 28 percent of which has survived through the years, also supports statements that Joseph dictated the text from another language in a short period of time. \n \n “For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript,” the topic page states. “In addition, some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript, suggesting that the base language of the translation was not English.” \n \n ‘Days never to be forgotten’ \n \n Joseph may have been the one called to translate the Book of Mormon, but Jensen emphasized that he was not completely alone in the process. \n \n “We have a lot of faithful individuals who believed in the Book of Mormon, believed in the power of the Book of Mormon and who were willing to put up with a lot of drudgery, and then of course later in church history, a lot of trial, a lot of hardship,” Jensen said. \n \n Jensen highlighted Joseph\'s scribes as examples of others who performed “time-intensive” work during the process. \n \n Oliver Cowdery is known as the primary scribe for the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, but many others took up a quill to assist Joseph during the translation, according to Jensen. They include Martin Harris, a friend of Joseph’s who later was one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon and who financed the printing; Emma Smith; Samuel Smith, one of Joseph’s younger brothers; Reuben Hale, Joseph’s brother-in-law; and Christian Whitmer, one of the sons of the Whitmer family who allowed Joseph to finish translating in their home in Fayette, New York. Christian’s brother John Whitmer also may have served as scribe for a time, and there is handwriting of an additional unidentified scribe found in the original manuscript. \n \n After completing the first manuscript, Joseph also asked Cowdery to take charge on creating a second copy of the text to provide to E.B. Grandin’s printing office in Palmyra, New York. Although Hyrum Smith and another unidentified scribe assisted, Cowdery wrote the bulk of the scripture by hand twice, according to Jensen. \n \n “Think of the hand cramps that Oliver Cowdery had to endure,” Jensen said. \n \n But for Cowdery, the opportunity to assist with the translation and publication of the Book of Mormon was a treasured one. \n \n “These were days never to be forgotten — to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven,” Cowdery said, according to the translation topic page. \n \n The “drudgery” that set the stage for the coming forth of the Book of Mormon extended into the realm of housework and farm chores. One person known for providing assistance with the everyday matters was Mary Whitmer, the mother of the Whitmer family. \n \n Jensen said Mary Whitmer’s grandson John C. Whitmer told of her being “bogged down” with the additional cooking, cleaning and other house chores that came as a result of Joseph and other visitors staying in her home during the translation process. One day while she was milking the cows, Mary Whitmer saw an angel who acknowledged her hard work and proceeded to show her the gold plates. \n \n “From that moment, my grandmother was enabled to perform her household duties with comparative ease, and she felt no more inclination to murmur because her lot was hard,” said John C. Whitmer, as cited in an article Jensen wrote titled “A Bit of Old String” on history.lds.org. \n \n Jensen also pointed out that contributions were even made by some who didn’t believe in the Book of Mormon as a book of divine origin, including John H. Gilbert, who was the principal typesetter at Grandin’s printing office. As Joseph dictated the translation to the scribes, he “did not call for punctuation.” Therefore, both the original manuscript and the printer’s manuscript were devoid of it, according to the topic page. The task of punctuating the Book of Mormon and setting the type, letter by letter, was left to Gilbert, a job he “took pride” in later in life, Jensen said. \n \n The Book of Mormon today \n \n The Book of Mormon has gone a long way since it first hit the shelves of Grandin’s bookshop in the small town of Palmyra, New York. More than 168 million copies have been distributed since March 1830, according to LDS Church Public Affairs, and an average of 4.5 million physical copies are distributed each year. With 110 different language translations of the book and digital translations available in 40 different languages on scriptures.lds.org and the Gospel Library app, the Book of Mormon continues to expand the church’s reach. \n \n “You could very much make the case that the LDS Church was founded on the publication of a book,” Jensen said. “Word of mouth only has a limited radius. It really was the publication of this book, and therefore this dissemination of this information through missionaries and others, that people began to hear about and then believe in Joseph Smith, his prophetic calling and the Restoration.” \n \n Email: wbutters@deseretnews.com, Twitter: WhitneyButters']",4,"– To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time. The images of the ""seer stone"" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the ""printer's manuscript"" of the Book of Mormon—a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from ""reformed Egyptian"" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: ""Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument."" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a ""a series of miraculous events."" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more ""tangible"" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. ""Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting."" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)"
146,"[""The 12-year-old student that provided the THC-infused gummy candy that sent six students to the hospital faces seven felony charges and one misdemeanor charge. \n \n MULBERRY — Six Mulberry Middle School students were taken to the hospital after ingesting most of a 100-milligram block of THC-infused gummy candies Thursday morning. \n \n According to Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, Leviticus Jones, 12, somehow came into possession of the Green Hornet-brand gummies which, if taken as directed, would represent 10 individual doses. THC is the primary psychoactive chemical compound in cannabis. \n \n Detectives are investigating how Jones acquired the gummy candies, as recreational use and possession of THC without a state-issued medical card is illegal in Florida. Edible products, such as the candy, are not currently available from dispensaries under state medical marijuana rules. \n \n “I warned us that all of this was coming,” Judd said in a press conference across from the school Thursday afternoon. Judd had been a staunch opponent of 2016's Amendment 2, the state constitutional amendment that made medical marijuana legal under state law, and earlier attempts by proponents for medical use. \n \n Jones' parents are cooperating with investigators, Judd said, and understand the gravity of the situation. \n \n Judd said that Jones shared the gummies with some friends during gym class. \n \n A total of six children in seventh grade partook, Judd said — two boys and four girls. \n \n Five were taken to the hospital via ambulance and one was transported by his or her parents. \n \n Jones faces seven felony charges — six counts of distribution within 1,000 feet of a school and one on possession of cannabis resin — and a misdemeanor charge of possession of paraphernalia. \n \n Judd said all the children are going to make a “great recovery,” but added “obviously we are concerned how a 12-year-old could come into possession of this drug, this illegal drug in the state of Florida. And two, why did he offer it to these six kids, which quite frankly, with the exception of one little quarter left, have apparently devoured this bar during gym class?” \n \n Polk County Schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd said she applauds the staff for their quick response. \n \n “When they heard something had happened with the students, they responded immediately,” she said. \n \n Byrd said they went by classroom to check the children, contacted emergency medical services, and their parents. \n \n “But you know, the sad part of this is, again, we could have been here with a different outcome,” she said. \n \n “They followed through with the procedures and protocols we have in place in making sure that we keep our children safe. What I want to say to parents is everyone at school today is still safe, they will be safe again tomorrow, they are going to be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe,” Byrd added. \n \n Byrd urged parents to monitor their children's online activity to see what they may be purchasing. \n \n “The sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe,” Byrd said. \n \n The children suffered stomachaches, dizziness, and one of them had almost passed out, Judd said. \n \n Kathy Leigh Berkowitz can be reached at 863-802-7558 or kberkowitz@theledger.com.

(Associated Press) \n \n The biggest outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outside the region where it was first seen in 2012 was introduced to South Korea last month by a 68-year-old man who had traveled to Saudi Arabia and other nearby countries. \n \n When he got sick after his return to South Korea, he visited several hospitals and clinics, where dozens of other patients and hospital workers were infected before officials found he had MERS. Gradually, the government began isolating victims and quarantining those who\'d had contact with them. \n \n There has been widespread fear here of the poorly understood disease, which has no vaccine and as much as a 40 percent mortality rate. There also had been growing criticism over failures by health workers and the government to initially recognize and quickly contain the disease. \n \n Nearly 3,000 people have been placed in isolation and 2,200 schools closed in South Korea. Although MERS spreads through close contact with sick people, not through the air, many people here have avoided going to crowded places like baseball parks and movie theaters. Travel agencies report a sharp increase in the number of foreigners canceling plans to visit South Korea. \n \n The outbreak, however, has so far been contained in hospitals and there\'s no evidence, the U.N. health agency says, of ""sustained transmission in the community."" \n \n Authorities say the first MERS patient didn\'t reveal his Saudi Arabia trip to doctors until he arrived at the Seoul-based Samsung Medical Center after being treated at three other hospitals, including St. Mary\'s Hospital in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul. Samsung and St. Mary\'s have seen most of the country\'s infections. \n \n The initial patient\'s wife, who was the country\'s second MERS case and is now out of the hospital, recently told a local TV station that her husband didn\'t intend to hide information about his travels, but simply had trouble talking to doctors because of his high fever. \n \n Because the virus\' incubation period is estimated at five to six days on average, extending up to about two weeks, experts believe there won\'t be any more cases directly infected by the first patient. The Health Ministry said that no more MERS cases have originated from St. Mary\'s Hospital. \n \n There are still concerns about Samsung Medical Center, where at least 37 people have been infected, although fewer cases have been reported there in recent days. \n \n The initial patient was eventually isolated on May 20 after doctors at Samsung, where the man ended up, suspected he had MERS and alerted the government, which moved him to a government-run facility. But a week later, another so-called ""super-spreader"" — a man who\'d been infected by the initial patient at St. Mary\'s Hospital — checked into an overcrowded Samsung Medical Center, where he was forced to stay for several days in the emergency room. He spread the disease among doctors, visitors and other patients there, according to health officials. \n \n The maximum incubation period for those infected by the second ""super-spreader"" ends around this Friday, experts said, which raises hopes that the outbreak could weaken soon. \n \n ""I cautiously predict (MERS) will peak today"" and be stabilized in the next few days, Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo told lawmakers Monday. \n \n The prospects for the virus weakening this week depend on whether there are many people who have evaded government quarantine measures and infected other people in various places, said Jacob Lee, an infectious disease expert at Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital in Seoul. \n \n World Health Organization experts arrived in South Korea on Monday to investigate the outbreak. \n \n There are concerns that South Korea\'s economy could suffer as tourism and business travel drop because of MERS fears. \n \n Hong Kong has issued a red travel warning for South Korea, the second highest of three levels, and advised residents against unnecessary travel there. Hong Kong has been hypersensitive to infectious diseases since the outbreak of SARS in 2003, which killed hundreds of people. \n \n MERS has mostly been centered in Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the family of coronaviruses that includes the common cold and SARS, and can cause fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Kelvin K.

""You meet someone and it just clicks,"" Esposito told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month. So with the SCOTUS decision over the summer to legalize gay marriage, the men looked forward to finally tying the knot. But one issue is holding them back: Esposito is technically Bosee's father, because he adopted him in 2012. ""We thought never in our lifetime—or in 20 lifetimes—...same-sex marriage [would] happen,"" Bosee said, adding to CNN that the adoption ""gave us the most legitimate thing available to us"" at the time. Even though they petitioned to have the adoption annulled, Allegheny County Judge Lawrence O'Toole —known for being progressive on LGBT issues—rejected that plea, noting that adoptions are typically only dissolved when fraud is involved and that nixing theirs ""would place in jeopardy and imperil adoption decrees generally."" Adoptions of this sort are often sought to cement legal status for financial and other reasons, as well as to strengthen emotional ties. The men said it was both: Esposito told the Post-Gazette ""we felt we lacked a family of our own,"" but they also discovered that any money they inherited from each other would be subject to a much greater inheritance tax if they weren't considered relatives. One person on the couple's side: Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who tells the Post-Gazette, ""I wasn't aware that LGBT couples were turning to this method. I can't even imagine having to get an adoption petition approved … to visit a loved one in the hospital."" Casey has written a letter of support to AG Loretta Lynch, asking her office to ""consider issuing guidance"" in cases like this; her office is reviewing it, a rep tells CNN.

147,"['Abu Dhabi: The record drop in oil prices from more than $110 per barrel in 2014 to less than $40 per barrel this year has forced the Saudi government to reform its economy and look beyond oil, analysts said on Monday. \n \n “There is no doubt that low oil prices is the main reason why Saudi Arabia is undertaking reforms to diversify its economy. In the long run, the new measures announced by the government will benefit the economy,” said Edward Bell, commodity analyst from Emirates NBD. \n \n As part of the new reforms announced on Monday, tourism will be encouraged and new industries will be set up. \n \n “We have developed a case of oil addiction in Saudi Arabia,” Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said in an interview to Al Arabiya Television. “I think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive,” he added. \n \n The government is undertaking reforms as oil prices slump due to over production and weak demand. \n \n In a landmark decision in December, the Saudi government cut subsidies and raised fuel prices by 50 per cent. \n \n “Being dependent of just one source of income makes an economy incredible vulnerable to price shocks and makes forward planning very difficult,” said Ole Hansen, an analyst from Saxo Bank. \n \n He said using the oil wealth to diversify is the only way forward for the economy to survive in the long term. \n \n “A fast growing population and no history of paying tax and jobs making little or no meaning, requires changes in order to compete in the global market place.” \n \n According to a report issued by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in December it may take many years for oil prices to recover and reach the level of more than $110 per barrel witnessed in June 2014, \n \n The oil producers group expects the price of its basket of crudes to rise to $70 a barrel in 2020 and $95 a barrel in 2040. \n \n Analysts predicted an average price of $40 in 2016 and $45 in 2017. Brent, the global benchmark was trading at less than $45 per barrel on Monday. \n \n “The price of oil will bounce further as we move towards the end of 2016 and into 2017. Billions of dollars of capex cut will eventually change the focus in the market from oversupply to the potential lack of supply,” Hansen added. \n \n In 2015, Saudi Arabia registered a budget deficit of 16 per cent of GDP and with government reforms announced December 2015, Saudi Arabia is expected to register a budget deficit of 13 per cent of GDP.', ""RIYADH (Reuters) - The powerful young prince overseeing Saudi Arabia’s economy unveiled ambitious plans on Monday aimed at ending the kingdom’s “addiction” to oil and transforming it into a global investment power. \n \n (L-R) Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi King Salman, and Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stand together after Saudi Arabia's cabinet agrees to implement a broad reform plan known as Vision 2030 in Riyadh, April 25, 2016. REUTERS/Saudi Press Agency/Handout via Reuters \n \n Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the world’s top oil exporter expects state oil company Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL] to be valued at more than $2 trillion ahead of the sale of less than 5 percent of it through an initial public offering (IPO). \n \n He added that the kingdom would raise the capital of its public investment fund to 7 trillion riyals ($2 trillion) from 600 billion riyals ($160 billion). \n \n The plans also included changes that would alter the social structure of the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom by pushing for women to have a bigger economic role and by offering improved status to resident expatriates. \n \n “We will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity price volatility or external markets,” Prince Mohammed said at his first news conference with international journalists, who were invited to a Riyadh palace for the event. \n \n “We have developed a case of oil addiction in Saudi Arabia,” he had earlier told al-Arabiya television news channel. \n \n His “Vision 2030” envisaged raising non-oil revenue to 600 billion riyals ($160 billion) by 2020 and 1 trillion riyals ($267 billion) by 2030 from 163.5 billion riyals ($43.6 billion) last year. But the plan gave few details on how this would be implemented, something that has bedevilled previous reforms. \n \n The 31-year-old prince gave assured answers to questions on the plan, and appeared to pitch his comments to appeal across the Saudi social spectrum, and in particular to young people, who face unemployment and an economic downturn despite their country’s oil wealth. \n \n Even before oil prices started to plunge in 2014, economists had regarded Riyadh’s fiscal policy and economic structure as being unsustainable, but reduced income from energy sales has made reform more urgent. \n \n The plan appeared to lift sentiment on the Saudi stock market .TASI, where shares jumped by 2.5 percent in the heaviest trading for eight months, but it fell short of convincing skeptics that the kingdom can prosper in an era of cheap oil. \n \n At the center of the plan is the restructuring of its Public Investment Fund (PIF), which Prince Mohammed said would become a hub for Saudi investment abroad, partly by raising money through selling shares in Aramco. \n \n Asked where Riyadh would find the funds for a $2 trillion dollar fund after recent borrowing, he said it would come from transferring the ownership of Aramco to the PIF. \n \n “We are speaking about more than $2 trillion. We expect the valuation to be more than $2 trillion. In addition to that there are other assets that will be added to the fund, and part of it is already added. \n \n He said it could “turn into a global investment fund with a size of up to $3 trillion dollars”. \n \n OPENING ARAMCO ACCOUNTS \n \n The partial privatization of Aramco was also central to the plans, and Prince Mohammed said it would be transformed into an energy company that he expected to be valued at $2 trillion to $3 trillion, and that less than 5 percent of it would be listed on the stock market. \n \n So big is the state oil company because of its rights to the kingdom’s crude reserves, that selling even 1 percent of its value would create the biggest initial public offering (IPO) on earth, he said. \n \n He said other Aramco subsidiary companies would also be listed along with other publicly held companies, and added that one major benefit of privatization was that it would increase transparency and help limit corruption. \n \n “People used to be unhappy that files and data of Aramco are undeclared, unclear and not transparent. Today they will be transparent.

Despite previous reform attempts, the kingdom’s schools have long been seen as focused on religious teachings rather than preparing students for a role in a modern economy. \n \n Under the plans, Saudi Arabia would produce or assemble half of its defense equipment internally in order to create job opportunities, he said, and Riyadh would make foreign investment easier. \n \n The government ran a deficit of 367 billion riyals ($98 billion) or 15 per cent of gross domestic product in 2015, officials said, and this year’s budget plan aimed to cut that to 326 billion riyals ($87 billion). \n \n His economic team has already announced efforts to curb wasteful government spending, to diversify revenue streams by introducing sales tax and privatizing state assets, and to make reforms in the education sector. \n \n Such was the speculation among Saudis over the details of the plan that hashtags associated with it were the top two trending on Twitter on Monday in the country with the highest rate of social media use in the Middle East. \n \n But ambitious targets, such as raising the private sector share in the economy to 60 percent from 40 percent, reducing unemployment to 7.6 percent from 11 percent and growing non-oil income to 1 trillion riyals ($267 billion) from 163 billion riyals ($44 billion) were not explained further. \n \n PLANS \n \n Some Saudis said they had hoped for more detail on crucial issues such as education reform. There were no further details of plans to increase revenue from tax or of any changes to the political structure of the absolute monarchy. \n \n “For me as a Saudi, I am concerned by the education transformation plan,” said a Saudi entrepreneur. “If it is not at the top of the list, why not?” \n \n However, the plan also envisaged increasing women’s participation in the workforce, something that has already grown quickly over the past five years, to 30 percent from 22 percent. \n \n But he also said he did not believe Saudi society was ready to end its ban on women driving. \n \n A green card system would also be launched within five years to enable expatriate Arabs and Muslims to live and work long-term in the country, Prince Mohammed said, in a major shift for the insular kingdom. \n \n But the focus was on economic restructuring to help reduce oil dependence. \n \n “I think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive,” Prince Mohammed said. “We need it, we need it, but I think in 2020 we can live without oil.” \n \n Slideshow (6 Images) \n \n Appealing to Saudi youth, he ended his news conference by promising them a new Saudi Arabia. \n \n “The vision is not a dream, it’s a reality that will come true,” he said. \n \n ($1 = 3.7489 riyals)"", 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most of Saudi Arabia\'s profits come from oil \n \n The Saudi cabinet has approved sweeping economic reforms aimed at moving the country away from its dependence on oil profits. \n \n Just over 70% of revenues came from oil last year but it has been hit by falling prices. \n \n One part of the plan will see shares sold in state-owned oil giant Aramco to create a sovereign wealth fund. \n \n Announcing the reforms, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described his country as being addicted to oil. \n \n Saudis react on social media \n \n The Vision 2030 plan, he told the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel, would ensure ""we can live without oil by 2020"". \n \n Among the reforms he announced in his interview were: \n \n Shares worth less than 5% of Aramco, a company he valued at up to $2.5tn (£1.7tn), will be sold \n \n Some of the proceeds will go towards a sovereign wealth fund worth $2tn \n \n A new visa system will allow expatriate Muslims and Arabs to work long term in Saudi Arabia \n \n Steps will be taken to diversify the economy, including investment in mineral mining and expanding military production \n \n Participation of women in the workforce to increase \n \n Even just selling 1% of Aramco would create the biggest initial public offering in history, the prince said, outstripping blockbuster sales like Facebook and Alibaba. \n \n The IMF called the Saudi plan an ""ambitious, far-reaching effort"" but warned implementation would be a challenge. \n \n The cost of oil: analysis by Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Saudi Arabia is the world\'s biggest crude exporter \n \n Oil has made Saudi Arabia a major economic force.

(Photo: AP) Story Highlights The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a probe into Tesla\'s Model S \n \n The probe of the electric car results from reports of battery fires \n \n Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he stands behind the car, but has ordered changes \n \n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today it has opened a formal investigation into the safety of the Tesla Model S electric car following two reports of battery fires after striking roadway debris. \n \n The agency said its safety investigation was prompted by recent ""undercarriage strikes"" in Washington state and Tennessee. In both cases, fires resulted after the cars both ran over debris on the road that pierced the battery compartment. After news of the probe broke, Tesla shares fell to $116 in pre-market trading but climbed back once the market opened. They closed 3.7%, or $4.51, up for the day at $126.09 a share. \n \n TESLA STOCK: Shares rise despite federal probe into fires \n \n Early Tuesday before NHTSA\'s announcement, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he taking three steps as a result of the fires, but added that he stands behind their safety. The steps were: \n \n •Higher ground clearance to make them less likely to strike road debris that can potentially penetrate the battery pack and ignite a blaze. \n \n •Asking federal safety regulators to ""conduct a full investigation as soon as possible into the fires."" Musk gave no hint that NHTSA was about to open an investigation. \n \n •Amending the cars\' warranty to cover damage due to fire. \n \n A NHTSA probe can lead to recall, but earlier this month Musk says he has no plans to order one because he doesn\'t think it is warranted. \n \n Musk announced the steps in a lengthy post on Tesla\'s blog. In it, he offers yet another strong defense of the car\'s safety, especially as it relates to protection from fire. ""We believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S,"" he writes. His company expects to produce more than 20,000 of the electric cars this year, which sell for about $70,000 and up. \n \n He calls media reaction to the three fires a gross overreaction, especially given how thousands of conventional cars have been consumed by gasoline fires from ruptured tanks over the years. \n \n He says his battery-powered car is actually safer than just about any gas-powered car on the road. \n \n Elon Musk CEO of Tesla with a new Model S car outside the Tesla customer deliver area at the Tesla Fremont, Calif., factory (Photo: Jessica Brandi Lifland for USA TODAY) \n \n ""Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world."" \n \n In the posting of its investigation, NHTSA noted that passengers in the Teslas that caught on fire were able to escape.

The third happened in Mexico when a Model S crashed. In each case, the occupants escaped unharmed. Musk says it\'s proof of the car\'s safety. \n \n But given the media outcry, Musk indicates he decided to act even though he already stands by the car. He says the plan to create more ground clearance under the cars has already been implemented. \n \n Tesla has already sent a signal to the computers in all Model S cars to tell them to increase the vehicle\'s ground clearance at highway speeds. he says the goal is to reduce the chance of hitting objects on the road. Another software update in January is aimed at letting drivers set their preferred road height for themselves and passengers. \n \n As for the NHTSA involvement in probing the three accidents that led to fires, Musk says that if regulators offers suggestions on how to improve fire safety in the Model S, he will immediately implement them. he has previously said he does not expect that the Model S will need to be recalled over the fires. \n \n When it comes to extending the warranty on the sedan, Musk says his decision will apply to Tesla models and be applicable even if the driver is held to be a fault for the fire. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/I0PQdJ', 'Federal safety regulators opened a probe into a series of fires in Tesla Motors Inc. electric cars following crashes. \n \n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday that it would investigate why two of the expensive Tesla Model S sporty hatchbacks have caught fire this year following accidents in which the battery casing that serves as the undercarriage of the car cracked open. \n \n LATEST: From the L.A Auto Show \n \n A third fire, which took place in Mexico, won’t be part of the investigation because it is outside the agency’s jurisdiction. \n \n NHTSA noted that in the two U.S. fires, one in Seattle and the other in Nashville, the battery monitoring system in the cars warned the drivers, allowing them to pull over and safely exit the vehicles before the battery emitted smoke and fire. \n \n The fires have become an issue for Tesla, contributing to 37% drop in the value of its stock since reaching a high of $193.37 on Sept. 30. The shares were down an additional 2% in overnight trading Tuesday. \n \n Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said the automaker requested the investigation to refute fears that electric cars are more prone to fires than other vehicles. \n \n [Updated 8:55 a.m. PST, Nov. 19: Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk claimed that the automaker requested the investigation to refute fears that electric cars were more prone to fires than other vehicles. \n \n But the NHTSA disputed that, saying its decision was an independent process. \n \n “In regards to Tesla, the agency notified the automaker of its plans to open a formal investigation and requested their cooperation,"" the agency said, ""which is standard agency practice for all investigations.” \n \n Tesla is already taking action, changing its warranty to cover damage due to a fire, even if due to driver error. \n \n “Either our belief in the safety of our car is correct and this is a minor cost,"" Musk said, ""or we are wrong, in which case the right thing is for Tesla to bear the cost rather than the car buyer.” \n \n The automaker believes the warranty change, which doesn’t apply if an owner purposefully sets the car on fire, will reassure buyers.] \n \n “If a false perception about the safety of electric cars is allowed to linger, it will delay the advent of sustainable transport and increase the risk of global climate change,” Musk wrote in a post to his blog on the Tesla website Monday night. \n \n PHOTOS: Tesla Model S \n \n The automaker is taking advantage of the car’s electronic capabilities to execute a wireless update to the air suspension that will result in greater ground clearance at highway speeds, Musk said. \n \n “This is about reducing the chances of underbody impact damage, not improving safety,” Musk said. “The theoretical probability of a fire injury is already vanishingly small and the actual number to date is zero.” \n \n Another software update expected in January will give the driver direct control of the air suspension ride height transitions. \n \n Musk also defended the automaker’s vehicles, writing that they have a lower fire risk than gasoline vehicles. \n \n “Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world,” Musk wrote.', 'Our goal when we created Tesla a decade ago was the same as it is today: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible. If we could have done that with our first product, we would have, but that was simply impossible to achieve for a startup company that had never built a car and that had one technology iteration and no economies of scale. Our first product was going to be expensive no matter what it looked like, so we decided to build a sports car, as that seemed like it had the best chance of being competitive with its gasoline alternatives. \n \n I suspected that this could be misinterpreted as Tesla believing that there was a shortage of sports cars for rich people, so I described the three step “master plan” for getting to compelling and affordable electric vehicles in my first blog piece about our company. This was unfortunately almost entirely ignored. \n \n In order to get to that end goal, big leaps in technology are required, which naturally invites a high level of scrutiny. That is fair, as new technology should be held to a higher standard than what has come before. However, there should also be some reasonable limit to how high such a standard should be, and we believe that this has been vastly exceeded in recent media coverage. \n \n How Does the Tesla Model S Fire Risk Compare to Gasoline Cars? \n \n Since the Model S went into production last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the United States alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and approximately 1,200 serious injuries (extrapolating 2012 NFPA data). However, the three Model S fires, which only occurred after very high-speed collisions and caused no serious injuries or deaths, received more national headlines than all 250,000+ gasoline fires combined. The media coverage of Model S fires vs. gasoline car fires is disproportionate by several orders of magnitude, despite the latter actually being far more deadly. \n \n Reading the headlines, it is therefore easy to assume that the Tesla Model S and perhaps electric cars in general have a greater propensity to catch fire than gasoline cars when nothing could be further from the truth. \n \n Journalists with a deep knowledge of the car industry, such as the news editor of Automotive News, understand and attempt to rebut this notion, but they have been drowned out by an onslaught of popular and financial media seeking to make a sensation out of something that a simple Google search would reveal to be false. I would also like to express appreciation for the investigative journalists who took the time to research and write an accurate article. \n \n The degree to which this is outrageous is described well in the above-mentioned Automotive News article. There are now substantially more than the 19,000 Model S vehicles on the road that were reported in our Q3 shareholder letter for an average of one fire per at least 6,333 cars, compared to the rate for gasoline vehicles of one fire per 1,350 cars. By this metric, you are more than four and a half times more likely to experience a fire in a gasoline car than a Model S! Considering the odds in the absolute, you are more likely to be struck by lightning in your lifetime than experience even a non-injurious fire in a Tesla. \n \n Those metrics tell only part of the story. The far more deadly nature of a gasoline car fire deserves to be re-emphasized. Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world. \n \n There is a real, physical reason for this: a gasoline tank has 10 times more combustion energy than our battery pack. Moreover, the Model S battery pack also has internal firewalls between the 16 modules and a firewall between the battery pack and passenger compartment. This effectively limits the fire energy to a few percent that of a gasoline car and is the reason why Dr. Shibayama was able to retrieve his pens and papers from the glove compartment completely untouched after the recent fire (caused by a high speed impact with a tow hitch). It is also why arsonists tend to favor gasoline. Trying to set the side of a building on fire with a battery pack is far less effective. \n \n What About Safety Overall? \n \n Our primary concern is not for the safety of the vehicle, which can easily be replaced, but for the safety of our customers and the families they entrust to our cars. Based on the Model S track record so far, you have a zero percent chance of being hurt in an accident resulting in a battery fire, but what about other types of accidents? Despite multiple high-speed accidents, there have been no deaths or serious injuries in a Model S of any kind ever. Of course, at some point, the law of large numbers dictates that this, too, will change, but the record is long enough already for us to be extremely proud of this achievement. This is why the Model S achieved the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the US government. The probability of injury is the most accurate statistical figure of merit, showing clearly that the Model S is safer in an accident than any other vehicle without exception. It is literally impossible for another car to have a better safety track record, as it would have to possess mystical powers of healing. \n \n Further Actions \n \n While we believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S, we are taking three specific actions. \n \n First, we have rolled out an over-the-air update to the air suspension that will result in greater ground clearance at highway speeds. To be clear, this is about reducing the chances of underbody impact damage, not improving safety. The theoretical probability of a fire injury is already vanishingly small and the actual number to date is zero. Another software update expected in January will give the driver direct control of the air suspension ride height transitions. \n \n Second, we have requested that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conduct a full investigation as soon as possible into the fire incidents. While we think it is highly unlikely, if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars. Given that the incidence of fires in the Model S is far lower than combustion cars and that there have been no resulting injuries, this did not at first seem like a good use of NHTSA’s time compared to the hundreds of gasoline fire deaths per year that warrant their attention. However, there is a larger issue at stake: if a false perception about the safety of electric cars is allowed to linger, it will delay the advent of sustainable transport and increase the risk of global climate change, with potentially disastrous consequences worldwide. That cannot be allowed to happen. \n \n Third, to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars, we will be amending our warranty policy to cover damage due to a fire, even if due to driver error. Unless a Model S owner actively tries to destroy the car, they are covered. Our goal here is to eliminate any concern about the cost of such an event and ensure that over time the Model S has the lowest insurance cost of any car at our price point. Either our belief in the safety of our car is correct and this is a minor cost or we are wrong, in which case the right thing is for Tesla to bear the cost rather than the car buyer. \n \n All of these actions are taken in order to make clear the confidence we have in our product and to eliminate any misperceptions regarding the integrity of our technology and the safety of our cars.']",3,"– Tesla is facing more scrutiny following three car fires in six weeks. First, investors launched a lawsuit; now, the government is getting involved, USA Today reports. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is now investigating two of the fires, both of which occurred after Model S undercarriages hit debris on the road (the other happened during a crash). In a blog post, CEO Elon Musk says his company asked for the investigation and writes that ""if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars."" But the NHTSA tells the LAT a different story: ""The agency notified the automaker of its plans to open a formal investigation and requested their cooperation, which is standard agency practice for all investigations."" Musk also says the company will increase the cars' ground clearance to help prevent them from hitting debris, and warranties will start covering fire damage, even in the event of driver error, ""to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars."" To that end: ""We believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S,"" Musk notes.

""It is the first time scientists have studied the brain responses specifically of people who identify as having hypersexual problems."" \n \n The study appears in the current online edition of the journal Socioaffective Neuroscience and Psychology. \n \n A diagnosis of hypersexuality or sexual addiction is typically associated with people who have sexual urges that feel out of control, who engage frequently in sexual behavior, who have suffered consequences such as divorce or economic ruin as a result of their behaviors, and who have a poor ability to reduce those behaviors. \n \n But, said Prause and her colleagues, such symptoms are not necessarily representative of an addiction — in fact, non-pathological, high sexual desire could also explain this cluster of problems. \n \n One way to tease out the difference is to measure the brain\'s response to sexual-image stimuli in individuals who acknowledge having sexual problems. If they indeed suffer from hypersexuality, or sexual addiction, their brain response to visual sexual stimuli could be expected be higher, in much the same way that the brains of cocaine addicts have been shown to react to images of the drug in other studies. \n \n The study involved 52 volunteers: 39 men and 13 women, ranging in age from 18 to 39, who reported having problems controlling their viewing of sexual images. They first filled out four questionnaires covering various topics, including sexual behaviors, sexual desire, sexual compulsions, and the possible negative cognitive and behavioral outcomes of sexual behavior. Participants had scores comparable to individuals seeking help for hypersexual problems. \n \n While viewing the images, the volunteers were monitored using electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique that measures brain waves, the electrical activity generated by neurons when they communicate with each other. Specifically, the researchers measured event-related potentials, brain responses that are the direct result of a specific cognitive event. \n \n ""The volunteers were shown a set of photographs that were carefully chosen to evoke pleasant or unpleasant feelings,"" Prause said. ""The pictures included images of dismembered bodies, people preparing food, people skiing — and, of course, sex. Some of the sexual images were romantic images, while others showed explicit intercourse between one man and one woman."" \n \n The researchers were most interested in the response of the brain about 300 milliseconds after each picture appeared, commonly called the ""P300"" response. This basic measure has been used in hundreds of neuroscience studies internationally, including studies of addiction and impulsivity, Prause said. The P300 response is higher when a person notices something new or especially interesting to them. \n \n The researchers expected that P300 responses to the sexual images would correspond to a person\'s sexual desire level, as shown in previous studies. But they further predicted that P300 responses would relate to measures of hypersexuality. That is, in those whose problem regulating their viewing of sexual images could be characterized as an ""addiction,"" the P300 reaction to sexual images could be expected to spike. \n \n Instead, the researchers found that the P300 response was not related to hypersexual measurements at all; there were no spikes or decreases tied to the severity of participants\' hypersexuality. So while there has been much speculation about the effect of sexual addiction or hypersexuality in the brain, the study provided no evidence to support any difference, Prause said. \n \n ""The brain\'s response to sexual pictures was not predicted by any of the three questionnaire measures of hypersexuality,"" she said. ""Brain response was only related to the measure of sexual desire. In other words, hypersexuality does not appear to explain brain responses to sexual images any more than just having a high libido."" \n \n But debate continues over whether sex addiction is indeed an addiction. A study published in 2012 by Prause\'s colleague Rory Reid, a UCLA assistant professor of psychiatry, supported the reliability of the proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for hypersexual disorder. However, Prause notes, that study was not focused on the validity of sex addiction or impulsivity, and did not use any biophysiological data in the analysis. \n \n ""If our study can be replicated,"" she said, ""these findings would represent a major challenge to existing theories of a sex \'addiction.\' "" \n \n Other authors on the study included Dr. Timothy Fong, associate professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and director of the UCLA Impulse Control Disorders Clinic; Vaughn R. Steele of the University of New Mexico; and Cameron Staley of Idaho State University. Funding was provided by an Idaho State University Graduate Student Committee grant (Staley). \n \n The UCLA Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences is the home within the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA for faculty who are experts in the origins and treatment of disorders of complex human behavior.

A new study published in last week’s journal of Socioaffective Neuroscience and Psychology suggests that maybe it doesn’t—bad news for celebrities like Tiger Woods and Russell Brand who have made it trendy in recent years to claim a clinical addiction to sex as an explanation for sexual misbehavior. \n \n The study (which, amazingly, is the first of its kind) measured how the brains of people who struggle with sexually compulsive behavior respond to sexual images. If sex can be addictive in the clinical sense, scientists theorized, then the neural response of sex addicts to pornography should mimic the neural responses of drug or alcohol addicts to their drugs of choice. Instead, researchers found that hypersexual brains don’t react in the same way as other addicts’ brains—in fact, the neural responses to pornography only varied based on levels of sexual libido, rather than on measures of sexual compulsivity. People with higher libidos had more active brain reactions to the sexual images than people with lower libidos, but that was the only correlation. Degrees of sexual compulsivity did not predict brain response at all. If the results of this first study can be replicated, it would represent a major challenge to the notion that sex and pornography can be literally addictive. \n \n “This is controversial territory because it represents a substantial shift in the way we view mental illness,” Dr. Nicole Prause, an assistant research scientist in the department of psychiatry at UCLA and one of the investigators involved with the study, told me. “Most people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an ‘addiction’—that’s how the public and even many clinicians talk about it. But this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n For the study, researchers recruited 52 people (39 men and 13 women) who reported having difficulties controlling their use of pornography and used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure their brain responses to various images. Some images were sexual in nature, such as kissing, nudity, and penetrative sex, while others were designed to be neutral or even unpleasant, such as pictures of skiers and dismembered bodies. Researchers analyzed brain response to the pictures in the first 300 milliseconds after the images appeared, commonly called a “P300.” Hundreds of neuroscience studies have relied on P300 measurements to analyze the brain’s response to various stimuli; for example, Prause said, several studies of substance addicts found increased P300 responses to images of their drugs of choice as compared to neutral images. \n \n “We expected the brain response to sexual stimuli to be consistent with other drugs of addiction, or even other behavioral addiction studies,” said Prause. “But we just don’t see that at all. We weren’t able to find evidence for any relationship between the measures of high-frequency sexual problems and the brain response to sexual images.” \n \n In a 2010 Psychology Today blog post, Dr. Michael Bader provocatively argued that “the addiction made me do it” is merely an excuse for people who want to avoid the difficult psychological thought and introspection required to address the real issues behind sexually compulsive behavior. Now this study has reignited the ongoing debate about whether sex and other so-called behavioral addictions—also known as process addictions, such as shopping and tanning—should be considered pathological alongside substance addictions such as nicotine, alcohol, and drugs. The third edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, released in 1987, included the term “sex addiction” under the category “Sexual Disorder—Not Otherwise Specified,” but that term was removed in subsequent editions. Hypersexual disorder was considered for inclusion in the recently released DSM-5 but was removed by the final draft. \n \n So here’s where we stand: Despite the familiarity of sex addiction in pop culture, hypersexual disorder is not an officially categorized diagnosis—and studies like this suggest that won’t change anytime soon. Nevertheless, mental health professionals around the world have reported patients who come to them seeking help with sexually compulsive behavior. So a problem does exist, and people who want treatment and support deserve access to it. But the debate about sex addiction underlines important questions about how psychiatrists should categorize the difference between a clinical mental illness that can be demonstrated in a lab, such as substance addiction, and other forms of mental distress, which deserve equal care and compassion but don’t necessarily indicate a medical mental illness. If we turn every single quirk of human sexuality into a “disease,” after all, then we’re all screwed. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n “We don't have a lot of information about what constitutes normative sexual behavior, so how can we conclusively determine what is deviant?” said Dr. Rory Reid, a neuropsychologist at UCLA and the principal investigator for the DSM-5 field trial on hypersexual disorder. “I don’t think there is enough evidence to conclude that patterns of hypersexual behavior constitute a bona fide disorder in the scientific realm, but we also don’t have enough evidence to dismiss that possibility. It certainly warrants further research and discussion.” \n \n Dr. Eli Coleman, who directs the program in human sexuality at the University of Minnesota Medical School, argues that any study that looks at compulsive sexual behavior from a traditional addiction model may be missing the mark. \n \n “One of the big problems with the term ‘sex addiction’ is that it immediately assumes that you can apply the same kinds of research methodologies and treatments that you would use for substance addiction,” said Coleman. “There are no sex receptors in the brain to develop tolerance and dependence, as there are with alcohol and drug addiction.” Hypersexuals don’t experience seizures or other physical symptoms of withdrawal when they abstain, for example, like alcohol and drug addicts do. Coleman suggests that for many people, hypersexual behavior seems to be a problem of impulse control or compulsive drive rather than a neural addiction. But, he added, even that explanation is probably too simplistic: Some people use sexual behavior to modulate mood states, and in others hypersexuality looks almost like attention deficit disorder. “It’s really very complex,” said Coleman. “And there has not been enough research to fully examine all of the underlying mechanisms.” \n \n Previous investigations into sex addiction have only measured the brains of sexual compulsives at rest (that is, without exposure to sexual imagery) or relied entirely on self-reported questionnaires, which are likely to be influenced by social ideas about what constitutes “normal” degrees of sexual behavior or desire. This new study is the first time that scientists have measured the active responses of hypersexual brains to sexual stimuli, which seems closer to the mark if scientists want to prove or dispel the clinical case for sex addiction. \n \n “The field is very strange, because experimental work is very rare in this area. Many people report feeling out of control sexually, but when we actually look for evidence of that in a lab, we can’t find it,” said Prause. “That’s why I’m aghast that we’re not doing more research in this area. Questionnaires are valuable, but we need to do more work to determine if what people are reporting is actually true.” \n \n Prause points out why there haven’t been funds directed toward scientific research that might challenge the existence of sex addiction: If something is a disease, there is money to be made from treating it. (One Christian organization, for example, charges $1,275 for a three-day seminar called “Every Man’s Battle” that claims to treat men who “find themselves pulled into the use of pornography” or who “seek out sexual gratification through compulsive masturbation.”)""]",2,"– The term ""sex addiction"" might get tossed around a lot these days as a way to explain some not-so-classy behavior of the Anthony Weiner-Tiger Woods variety, but is it really an addiction on par with drugs or alcohol? The first study to explore brain responses in people who describe themselves as hypersexual suggests otherwise, reports UCLA. Researchers there showed the subjects—39 men and 13 women—sexual images, and discovered that their brains didn't respond in the same way that, say, a cocaine addict would respond to images of cocaine. “Most people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an ‘addiction’—that’s how the public and even many clinicians talk about it,"" one of the researchers tells Slate. ""But this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems.” The subjects have higher libidos, or sexual desire, but not necessarily a clinical medical problem. They still need help, but if further studies verify this first one, then the type of help they'll get will be affected. All of which might be OK, writes Jillian Keenan at Slate. ""If we turn every single quirk of human sexuality into a 'disease,' after all, then we’re all screwed."" The study is in the journal Socioaffective Neuroscience & Psychology."

Story Highlights Superior Court judge: du Pont heir ""will not fare well"" in prison \n \n Court records show Richards as 6-foot-4, between 250 and 276 pounds. \n \n Jurden ordered Richards to ""participate in a sex offenders"" treatment program \n \n A Superior Court judge who sentenced a wealthy du Pont heir to probation for raping his 3-year-old daughter noted in her order that he ""will not fare well"" in prison and needed treatment instead of time behind bars, court records show. \n \n Judge Jan Jurden\'s sentencing order for Robert H. Richards IV suggested that she considered unique circumstances when deciding his punishment for fourth-degree rape. Her observation that prison life would adversely affect Richards was a rare and puzzling rationale, several criminal justice authorities in Delaware said. Some also said her view that treatment was a better idea than prison is a justification typically used when sentencing drug addicts, not child rapists. \n \n Richards\' 2009 rape case became public this month after attorneys for his ex-wife Tracy filed a lawsuit seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the abuse of his daughter. \n \n The fact that Jurden expressed concern that prison wasn\'t right for Richards came as a surprise to defense lawyers and prosecutors who consider her a tough sentencing judge. Several noted that prison officials can put inmates in protective custody if they are worried about their safety, noting that child abusers are sometimes targeted by other inmates. \n \n ""It\'s an extremely rare circumstance that prison serves the inmate well,"" said Delaware Public Defender Brendan J. O\'Neill, whose office represents defendants who cannot afford a lawyer. ""Prison is to punish, to segregate the offender from society, and the notion that prison serves people well hasn\'t proven to be true in most circumstances."" \n \n O\'Neill said he and his deputies have often argued that a defendant was too ill or frail for prison, but he has never seen a judge cite it as a ""reason not to send someone to jail."" \n \n Commentary: Take into account entire sentencing process \n \n Our view: Real questions about the Richards case \n \n Earlier story: Police investigated du Pont sex abuse claim \n \n Earlier story: Du Pont heir faces child sex lawsuit \n \n Richards was no frail defendant, court records show, listing him at 6 feet, 4 inches tall and between 250 and 276 pounds.

""That procedure was followed in this case as well."" \n \n The lawsuit filed by Richards\' ex-wife accuses him of admitting to sexually abusing his infant son between 2005 and 2007, the same period when he abused his daughter starting when she was 3. \n \n Police said they investigated allegations involving the boy in 2010 after his mother filed a complaint, but said they did not have sufficient evidence to justify charges. Investigators will take another look at the allegations included in the lawsuit, which are based on reports by probation officers. \n \n CLOSE Robert H. Richards IV, a du Pont family heir who raped his 3-year-old daughter nearly a decade ago but received no prison time now faces a lawsuit from his former wife that accuses him of sexually abusing his toddler son. (3/18/14) \n \n The plea offer \n \n Attorney General Beau Biden\'s office had initially indicted Richards on two counts of second-degree rape of a child – Class B violent felonies that carry a mandatory 10-year prison term for each count. \n \n According to the arrest warrant filed by a New Castle County Police Detective JoAnna Burton in December 2007, the girl, then 5, told her grandmother, Donna Burg, that Richards sexually abused her. \n \n Burg said the child reported that her father told her it was ""our little secret"" but said she didn\'t want ""my daddy touching me anymore."" The girl said her father molested her in the bedrooms of her mother and brother in the mansion at 10 Summit Lane near Winterthur Museum, the arrest warrant said. \n \n Tracy Richards, who confronted her then-husband, told police he admitted abusing his daughter but said ""it was an accident and he would never do it again,"" the warrant said. \n \n Richards was free on $60,000 secured bail while awaiting trial on the charges that could have put him behind bars for years. \n \n But in June 2008, just days before a scheduled trial, prosecutor Renee Hrivnak offered Richards a plea to a single count of fourth-degree rape, which carries no mandatory time, and he accepted, admitting in court that he abused his child. \n \n ""It was more than reasonable, an enlightened plea offer,"" Richards attorney Eugene J. Maurer Jr. said. \n \n Probation offered \n \n Fourth-degree rape is a Class C violent felony that by law can bring up to 15 years in prison, though guidelines suggest zero to 2½ years in prison. \n \n At his February 2009 sentencing, Hrivnak recommended probation, Biden\'s chief deputy Ian R. McConnel said, adding that in retrospect he wished she would have sought prison time. Hrivnak would not comment. \n \n Biden spokesman Jason Miller said the attorney general – who routinely hails the prosecution of child predators as a top priority for his office – did not know about the case. \n \n Miller said only Hrivnak and her supervisor, Allison Texter, were part of the decision on how to resolve the case. Texter, who is now in private practice in Wilmington, did not return calls for comment. \n \n State Prosecutor Kathleen M. Jennings could not discuss the case, McConnel said, because she had represented Richards while he was on probation. Jennings, a former chief deputy attorney general, rejoined the office in November 2011 after about 15 years in private practice. She would not say when she represented Richards. \n \n McConnel would not discuss the rationale behind the Richards\' plea deal and Hrivnak\'s recommendation of probation for the fourth-degree rape conviction. \n \n He noted, however that prosecutors handling child sex cases routinely have difficulty relying on the testimony of youngsters, especially if the defendant is their father. The well-being of the child is paramount in such cases and parents and prosecutors are often reluctant to put children through the trauma of testifying and being cross-examined, he said. \n \n ""These cases are extremely complicated and difficult and we strive to do justice in each and every case to the best of our ability given the facts and circumstances presented,"" McConnel said. ""That sometimes results in a resolution that is less than what we would want."" \n \n \'Will not fare well\' \n \n While judges have the latitude to sentence defendants within legal parameters, they are urged to follow more lenient guidelines established by the Delaware Sentencing Accountability Commission, a panel of judges and other top officials in the criminal justice system. The panel, known as SENTAC, has a policy that prison should be reserved for violent offenders, including rapists. \n \n Jurden gave Richards, who had no previous criminal record, an eight-year prison term, but suspended all the prison time for probation. \n \n ""Defendant will not fare well in Level 5 setting,"" said the final line of her sentencing order. In Delaware\'s correctional system, Level 5 is prison. \n \n Joseph S. Grubb, chief New Castle County prosecutor, said he was not involved in the case, but stressed that whether Richards\' might suffer or thrive in prison was not something prosecutors considered. \n \n ""It\'s not a concern for us,"" Grubb said. ""We try to do the right thing in each case. Absent that equation is the physical condition of the defendant."" \n \n Grubb said he did not know ""how the judge gathered"" that Richards might have trouble in prison, but assumed the presentence report included information she used. That report was not available in the court file. \n \n Buy Photo Delaware Public Defender Brendan J. O’Neill (Photo: The News Journal/FRED COMEGYS) \n \n O\'Neill, the public defender, said that while Jurden\'s rationale surprised him, ""I commend her for making such a courageous ruling. When I find the appropriate place, I\'m going to make that argument."" \n \n Defense lawyer Michael W. Modica said he has argued that clients should be spared prison because of medical or mental issues, but judges routinely reject the suggestion. He said he recently persuaded a prosecutor not to recommend prison for a client who had cardiac bypass surgery while awaiting sentencing for a DUI, and the judge sentenced the man to home confinement. \n \n ""I\'ve never heard of the judge saying in general that he is not going to do well,"" Modica said. ""Who thrives in jail?"" \n \n Treatment sentence \n \n Jurden also ordered Richards to ""participate in a sex offenders"" treatment program after his lawyer provided her with an evaluation from a clinic in Massachusetts. Her order stipulated that he undergo inpatient treatment followed by outpatient treatment. The judge also ordered him to have no contact with children under 16 and prohibited him from possessing pornography. \n \n Jurden\'s order also included other mitigating circumstances considered before sentencing, citing his ""strong family support"" and ""significant treatment needs which must be met."" The order noted, ""Treatment needs exceed need for punishment,"" which the SENTAC manual lists as a factor for judges to consider. \n \n Attorneys said a treatment sentence is more common for first-time drug offenders, drunk drivers and the mentally ill, but is not unheard of for sex offenders. ""It\'s not completely out of left field that a judge would say that,"" Grubb said. \n \n Prosecutor Josette Manning, who spent six years in the sex crimes unit, said juvenile offenders in Delaware are often sent to out-of-state treatment facilities rather than a detention center. Some adults can get sex treatment in prison, she said, but when an offender can afford to pay the cost of inpatient treatment themselves, judges sometimes make that part of the sentence instead of prison. \n \n ""It\'s absolutely appropriate for a judge to consider a defendant\'s treatment needs during sentencing"" for sex crimes, Manning said. \n \n Modica, who has represented numerous sex offenders, said he has seen the need for treatment as a factor in reduced sentences for defendants in child porn cases but not for sex crimes. ""I can\'t think of a case like that,"" he said. \n \n Richards spent eight months on Level 3 probation, which requires weekly contacts with a probation officer, before Jurden moved him down to Level 2, which requires only monthly visits with a probation officer. \n \n \'Right on\' \n \n County police chief Elmer Setting said that while police can\'t control how attorneys and a judge resolve a case, ""In serious situations where we have a guilty plea, we hope for prison time."" \n \n Kendall Marlowe, executive director of National Association for Counsel for Children, said the bottom line is that individuals who abuse youngsters deserve to be punished. \n \n ""Child protection laws are there to safeguard children, and adults who knowingly harm children should be punished,"" said Marlow, whose nonprofit agency assists lawyers who handle child welfare cases. \n \n ""Our prisons should be more rehabilitative environments, but the prison system\'s inadequacies are not a justification for letting a child molester off the hook."" \n \n Defense lawyer Joseph A. Hurley said it makes sense to him that the judge would be concerned about Richards\' time in prison. \n \n ""Sure, they have protective custody, but that is solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. We\'re not a third-world society,"" Hurley said. \n \n ""Sex offenders are the lowest of the low in prison,"" Hurley said. ""He\'s a rich, white boy who is a wuss and a child perv. The prison can\'t protect them, and Jan Jurden knows that reality. She is right on."" \n \n Contact senior reporter Cris Barrish at (302) 324-2785, cbarrish@delawareonline.com or on Facebook. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1jZU1Uo', ""Revealed: Multimillionaire du Pont family heir was spared jail for raping his three-year-old daughter because judge decided he would 'not fare well' behind bars \n \n Robert Richards was charged with fourth-degree rape of his young daughter but was spared jail \n \n Shocking details about the offense and an alleged assault on his infant son have emerged in a lawsuit brought about by his ex-wife Tracy \n \n Richards is an unemployed heir living off his multi-million dollar trust fund \n \n His ex-wife is suing for compensation for her two children and the emotional distress they've endured \n \n In sentencing him in 2009, Judge Jurden said Richards would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than prison \n \n \n \n Shocking details have emerged of how a multimillionaire heir to the du Pont chemical business was convicted of raping his three-year-old daughter but escaped serving prison time after a Delaware Superior Court judge ruled he would ‘not fare well’. \n \n \n \n Robert H.

He was released on $60,000 bail while awaiting his charges. \n \n \n \n Judge Jan Jurden, right, said Roberts, the great grandson of Irenee du Pont, left, would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than serving any prison time \n \n Richards hired one of the state's top law firms and was offered a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape charges - which carried no mandatory minimum prison sentencing. \n \n \n \n He accepted, and admitted to the assault, reports the Detroit Free Press. \n \n Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden sentenced Richards to eight years in prison but suspended that for Level II probation, which requires monthly visits with a case officer. \n \n In sentencing him, Judge Jurden said Richards would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than serving any prison time. \n \n \n \n Currently on probation, Richards has never been charged with crimes against his son. \n \n The lawsuit claims that Richards raped his daughter, now 11, in 2005 when she was three. \n \n \n \n Lawyers for Tracy Richards, far right, hold up photos of where her husband lives, the $1.8m mansion on the right and where she and their children currently rent on the left \n \n Several times, he entered her bedroom at night while she slept and penetrated her with his fingers while masturbating, said the lawsuit, which includes documents from the criminal case. \n \n Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville mansion that he paid $1.8 million for. \n \n Richards, who is 6'4 and about 250 lbs, told the girl 'to keep what he had done to her a secret,' but in October 2007 she told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards, the lawsuit said. \n \n \n \n The girl was taken to her pediatrician, whom she told about the abuse, and New Castle County police arrested him that December. \n \n Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville mansion that he paid $1.8 million for, pictured \n \n The proven abuse of his daughter and alleged assault of his son has caused his children 'long-term injuries,' the lawsuit filed Tuesday said, perhaps including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction and shame. \n \n His daughter also has 'repressed memories of some instances of the abuse she suffered,' and if the son was abused, the same is true with him, the suit said. \n \n \n \n With medical treatment, the lawsuit said, those memories will likely 'begin to surface.' \n \n 'Making matters worse this self admitted rapist and child abuser has not paid a single penny to these children for his crimes. There is no provision whatsoever for them for their future after they turn 18,' said Attorney Thomas Crumplar, who is representing Tracy Richards. \n \n \n \n At Tuesday's press conference he stood alongside Tracy and her mother Donna Burg. Burg, the maternal grandmother, is the one who alarmed Tracy of the abuse after talking to one of the grandchildren in 2007. \n \n \n \n Richards is a scion of two prominent Delaware families - the du Pont family who built the chemical empire and the Richards family who co-founded the prestigious corporate law firm Richards Layton & Finger. \n \n \n \n His father, Robert H. Richards III, was a partner in the law firm until his 2008 retirement. \n \n \n \n Video: Du Pont heir sued over abusing his own children""]",2,"– You'd expect some jail time for a child rapist, right? Not so for du Pont heir Robert H. Richards IV, who admitted to raping his 3-year-old daughter almost a decade ago, the Daily Mail reports. In a 2009 case that's only now coming to light, the News Journal reports that Delaware Judge Jan Jurden sentenced Richards to an eight-year prison term but suspended it for probation, plus a sex offenders rehabilitation program, because Richards ""will not fare well"" in prison and ""treatment needs exceed need for punishment."" The News Journal calls it ""a rare and puzzling rationale"" from a judge who is known for her tough sentencing, especially given that treatment is usually reserved for first-time drug offenders, drunk drivers, and the mentally ill. While some attorneys say such a sentence isn't unheard of, a public defender notes that the case raises questions about ""how a person with great wealth may be treated by the system."" A defense lawyer adds, ""I've never heard of the judge saying in general that he is not going to do well ... Who thrives in jail?"" A suit recently filed against Richards by his ex-wife is seeking damages for assaults on the couple's two children. Initially indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape, Richards took a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape, which carries no mandatory minimum prison sentence, the Daily Mail notes."
153,"['Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday won praise from some representatives of Chicago\'s immigrant community for going to court to block President Donald Trump\'s Department of Justice from withholding some police grant funding from so-called sanctuary cities. \n \n Some of those same activists, though, contend Emanuel should do even more to prevent police from helping federal officials deport Chicago immigrants who entered the country without the required legal documentation. The mayor also caught more flak from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who in stepping up his rhetoric said ""no amount of federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents."" \n \n The wide array of views coming from Emanuel\'s City Hall, the White House and immigrant protection groups is a sign of the complex debate the mayor has entered by filing the lawsuit. It\'s all further complicated by differing views on whether sanctuary city status fosters or hinders crime — as reflected in Sessions\' harsh words and the city\'s contention that the Trump ""administration\'s rhetoric is divorced from reality."" \n \n Emanuel\'s lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court, asks a judge to block the Trump administration from enforcing three new conditions it included last week in applications for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant money. The city uses the grant to help buy police cars, purchase other equipment and fund an anti-violence program. Those applications are due Sept. 5, and the city wants a court order before the deadline, said Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel, the city\'s top attorney. \n \n The new conditions outlined by Sessions\' Justice Department: sharing immigration status information with federal officials enforcing deportation laws, providing unlimited police station access to those officials and giving them 48-hours notice of an arrested person\'s release in cases of potential immigration violations. \n \n City officials contend in the lawsuit that they do share immigration status information when they have it, but that\'s rare because the city doesn\'t keep it in the normal course of business. \n \n Providing unfettered station access would interfere with police department practices, delay release of people being held and violate the 10th Amendment by ""commandeering"" local government functions, the lawsuit states. And holding people for 48 hours without a warrant or probable cause that they have committed a crime would violate 4th Amendment search and seizure limitations, it adds. \n \n The suit also contends that the Justice Department has no authority to set conditions on the Byrne grant funding and is attempting to usurp the Congressional power of the purse. In short, the suit deems the conditions ""unlawful and unconstitutional."" \n \n This year, the city was counting on receiving $3.2 million from the grants in question, a relatively miniscule portion of the city\'s overall $9.8 billion budget. \n \n ""We are at a time when every bit counts and every resource matters in this fight,"" Siskel said. ""In addition, we are bringing this legal challenge because the rhetoric and the threats from this administration, embodied in these new restrictions placed on public safety grant funds, are breeding a culture and a climate of fear within the communities in our city."" \n \n City corporation counsel Ed Siskel talks at Dirksen Federal Building about the Emanuel administration lawsuit against the Donald Trump Justice Department about sanctuary city rules.

They are Cook County, Bellwood, Calumet City, Chicago Heights, Cicero, Dolton, Evanston, Harvey, Maywood, Riverdale and Skokie. \n \n And the outcome of the suit could have ramifications for far-flung local and state governments with sanctuary laws on the books. They include New York, Philadelphia, Miami and the state of California. \n \n So it was no surprise that groups like Illinois Coalition for Immigration and Refugee Rights backed the mayor\'s move. ""We are all for defending Chicago\'s policy with respect to immigration,"" said Fred Tsao, the group\'s senior policy counsel. He also said ""the law is on the side of the city."" \n \n Yet Tsao\'s group is part of a broader coalition that for months has been pushing Emanuel to remove four exemptions from the city\'s Welcoming City Ordinance, which sets its status as a sanctuary city. \n \n That ordinance bars police from providing federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials access to people in local custody. It also prohibits allowing ICE agents to use police facilities for interviews or investigations, and bars on-duty officers from responding to ICE questions or talking to ICE officials prior to a person\'s release from custody. \n \n But it does allow police to provide ICE officials access to immigrants suspected of entering the country illegally who are wanted on a criminal warrant, face criminal charges, have serious criminal convictions or are listed on Chicago gang databases. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union maintains those exemptions, which could result in holding in custody someone not guilty of a recent crime, ""expose the city to liability for violations of the 4th Amendment,"" according to a letter the ACLU sent to the mayor and aldermen last month. \n \n Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th, has been pushing to get Chicago to join other cities that have eliminated similar exemptions, but the Emanuel administration so far has rebuffed his efforts, as recently as Friday by canceling a meeting on the issue. \n \n ""It\'s quite funny and hypocritical that at the same time as (Emanuel is) putting forward this lawsuit saying that we want to defend the Constitution, here the ACLU has said that our own sanctuary city policy is in violation of the supreme law of the land,"" said Ramirez-Rosa, who also stressed that he supports the lawsuit. \n \n Ramirez-Rosa\'s view runs counter to the image Emanuel has tried to portray on the issue in mostly Democratic Chicago, which has a significant Latino population that\'s become increasingly politically active.', 'Attorney General Jeff Sessions\' combative statement, which accused Chicago officials of adopting ""an official policy of protecting criminal aliens,"" is likely to be well received by President Donald Trump. | Andrew Harnik/AP Sessions blasts Rahm Emanuel over sanctuary suit \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions lashed out at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday, delivering an unusually caustic reaction to a new lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\'s plans to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities. \n \n Emanuel announced the filing of the suit earlier in the day, complaining about a new Justice Department policy attempting to cut off grants to police departments that decline to cooperate with federal immigration officials. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Sessions\' barbed reply argued that record numbers of murders in Chicago in recent years were attributable at least in part to Emanuel\'s decision to stick with a sanctuary policy that encourages police to ignore the immigration status of those they encounter. \n \n ""No amount of federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents,"" Sessions said. ""To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system."" \n \n The attorney general\'s combative statement, which accused Chicago officials of adopting ""an official policy of protecting criminal aliens,"" is likely to be well received by President Donald Trump.

""So it’s this simple: Comply with the law or forgo taxpayer dollars."" \n \n However, the new lawsuit argues it\'s the Justice Department that isn\'t complying with the law. No law obliges local governments to actively assist immigration officers or to notify them when illegal immigrants are released from jail. \n \n The Trump administration is trying to add such requirements to certain law-enforcement grants issued in the future, but Chicago\'s suit contends that Justice Department officials lack the authority to add anti-sanctuary-city requirements beyond a single provision barring grant recipients from policies that punish officers for contacting federal officials about a suspected undocumented immigrant. \n \n Other cities are considering similar lawsuits. Indeed, localities in California and Massachusetts have filed legal challenges to an early Trump executive order that many saw as threatening a broad crackdown on sanctuary cities. Emanuel and many law enforcement leaders argue that the policies benefit public safety by encouraging undocumented immigrants to cooperate and communicate with police. \n \n “Chicago is a welcoming city and always will be, and we will not be blackmailed by President Trump\'s Justice Department,"" Emanuel said as he announced the suit. ""Forcing us to choose between our values and our police department’s philosophy of community policing is a false choice, and it is a choice that would ultimately undermine our public safety agenda.""', ""After Rahm sues feds, A.G.

Danny Davis (right) announces a federal lawsuit challenging the Justice Department's threats to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities and states. | Nader Issa/Sun-Times \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday blasted the “political leadership of Chicago” and “the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city” just hours after Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration sued Sessions to bar him from cutting federal crimefighting funds to sanctuary cities. \n \n Rather than take a hands-off approach to the now-pending litigation, Sessions stepped up attacks on Chicago, the city that has been repeatedly bashed by President Donald Trump because of its ongoing problems with controlling crime. \n \n “To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system,” Sessions said in a prepared statement. “They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement — federal, state, and local — and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents. \n \n “This is astounding given the unprecedented violent crime surge in Chicago, with the number of murders in 2016 surpassing both New York and Los Angeles combined. The city’s leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve. \n \n “The mayor complains that the federal government’s focus on enforcing the law would require a ‘reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago.’ But that’s just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that roll back the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.” \n \n Though the Trump administration has attempted to link sanctuary-city status to the city’s crime problem, the Chicago Sun-Times has reported that illegal immigrants have played no role in the overwhelming majority of the murders that have put the city in the national spotlight. \n \n “I have been a police officer for more than 30 years, and the federal government’s plans will hamper community policing and public safety,” Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said in response to Sessions. “Undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that’s why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police.” \n \n With the filing of the lawsuit against Sessions, Chicago becomes the fourth city to wage a legal battle against the Trump administration bid to cut the crimefighting grants to sanctuary local governments. \n \n Other lawsuits to block the Justice Department from punishing cities shielding illegal immigrants from federal immigration agents have been filed in federal courts in Seattle, and in California: Santa Clara and San Francisco. \n \n And while each has its own unique facts and circumstances, Chicago’s legal team is tapped in to the loose network of lawyers that has formed for many of these sanctuary cities. \n \n “We are in regular contact with lawyers in cities and counties around the country related to these issues,” city Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel said – including from New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Philadelphia. \n \n Chicago’s 46-page complaint asks U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber — assigned to the case Monday — to stop the Justice Department from enforcing new conditions it has attached to the grant funds. \n \n The city appears to be making a solid legal case, according to two experts from the University of Chicago Law School: Professor Aziz Huq and Assistant Professor Daniel Hemel. Both pointed out that, according to the city’s lawsuit, Congress did not give the Justice Department the power to create new conditions when it created the grant program. \n \n The Justice Department in recent days detailed the new rule and conditions sanctuary jurisdictions must follow. The first condition would require the city to give the feds, when they ask for it, a 48-hour heads up of the scheduled release date and time “of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody.” \n \n The second would require the city to give the feds access to “any correctional or detention facility in order to meet with an alien . . . and inquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.” However, the city points out in its lawsuit that Chicago does not have a jail — only 18 temporary police “lockup” facilities. \n \n The city claims the Justice Department is also asking it to again certify its compliance with a federal law barring local governments from not sharing immigration status information with the feds. It is asking to the city to do so “under the cloud of confusion” created by the new grant conditions, the city is alleging.""]",3,"– The war of words between Chicago and the federal government over ""sanctuary cities"" policy is heating up.

154,"[""“Everyone is affected,” said Iqbal Jamil, a heat-flustered resident of Landhi, a neighborhood in Karachi. \n \n The crisis is the product of multiple factors, from decrepit power plants to crumbling transmission lines to decades-old policy mistakes. One reason, however, stands above the others: most Pakistanis will not pay their bills. \n \n The system is paralyzed by $5 billion in “circular debt” — basically, a long chain of unpaid bills that cuts across society, from government departments to wealthy politicians to slum dwellers. At its worst, this leaves power providers with no funds to pay for fuel, so their plants slow or shut down entirely. \n \n As a political issue, electricity has galvanized the Pakistani public — more so, even, than Islamist militancy. Mr. Sharif swept to victory in the May 11 election in part on the appeal of slogans promising to deliver a “shining Pakistan” and to “end the darkness.” \n \n Analysts say the question is whether Mr. Sharif has the political backbone to make the tough decisions needed to change the system, particularly as some of his own supporters, along with other rich and powerful Pakistanis, are among the bill defaulters who need to start paying their fair share. \n \n “This is not like finding a cure for cancer — people know what needs to be done,” said Robert M. Hathaway, director of the Asia program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, D.C., who has written a book on Pakistan’s electricity crisis. “The problem is implementation, and finding the political will.” \n \n Photo \n \n The crisis has hit hardest in Mr. Sharif’s home province, Punjab. In Kharian, a Punjabi town along the historic Grand Trunk Road, Malik Mazhar Iqbal Awan, a businessman, fanned himself with a newspaper as beads of sweat rolled down his forehead. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Awan owns a small marble factory. In the yard outside, a handful of workers sat quietly beside a cutting machine, waiting for the power to return. Just four years ago, Mr. Awan said, he employed 25 people. Now he has just six. \n \n “I can’t pay their salaries,” he said, wiping away dust that had blown in through an open window. “How can I if we can only work a few hours every day?” \n \n Mr. Awan said he had voted for Mr. Sharif, a former steel baron, because he was “110 percent sure” the candidate could turn the electricity situation around. “He’s an industrialist,” he said. “He thinks differently than the others.” \n \n Although easing the $5 billion “circular debt” is the principal problem, experts say money is only part of the solution. Deep-rooted structural issues, exacerbated by political interference and systemic graft, lie at the heart of Pakistan’s power crisis. \n \n Electricity theft, by rich and poor, is common. Slum dwellers steal power through illegal connections; powerful politicians and government departments simply refuse to pay their bills. Electricity officials and the police, fearing retribution, dare not cut them off. \n \n Corruption is notorious in the private power sector, where political supporters win lucrative contracts, often at inflated costs or without even producing a megawatt of power. In 2011 the auditor general noted that the government had committed to $1.7 billion in such contracts, yet added just 62 megawatts to the national power grid. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After he lost his parliamentary seat in a crushing defeat, officials with the national anticorruption body stepped in, summoning Mr. Ashraf last week to answer accusations that he had taken kickbacks worth tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies on power projects. \n \n Even those supposed to be enforcing the law are breaking it. At one police station in Sindh Province, officers erected an illegal power connection for their air-conditioners. In other areas, electricity company officials are afraid to disconnect defaulters for fear of attack. \n \n About 20 percent of the electricity supply disappears across the country, and up to 33 percent in the worst-affected district, as a result of dilapidated transmission lines or outright theft, said Fariel Salahuddin, a power sector consultant. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “The fastest way to improve things is to start collecting bills and come down hard on theft,” she said. “That’s easier said than done, though.” \n \n Photo \n \n The crisis is exacting an economic toll equivalent to at least 4 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to economists — greater than the estimated economic cost of the Taliban insurgency. \n \n At the same time, government policy is a shambles. Decision-making is centered in the notoriously corrupt Energy Ministry; no major new power plant has been built for decades, and the existing ones are falling into disrepair. As a result, Pakistan relies heavily on expensive furnace oil imports. \n \n “There is complete disarray between all entities involved,” said a report on the power crisis that was commissioned by the National Planning Commission last March. \n \n In the short term, Mr. Sharif will seek to salve his power woes by trying to find foreign cash or fuel to get dormant power stations back on line. His officials have suggested that Saudi Arabia, a country that Mr. Sharif enjoys close relations with, could offer up to $15 billion worth of emergency oil supplies on favorable terms. \n \n But oil and money can provide only temporary relief, and Mr. Sharif may also seek other foreign assistance to tackle the structural problems — some in the face of opposition from the United States. \n \n Last week he asked the visiting Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, to provide Pakistan with help in building a civilian nuclear power plant. That was widely seen as an indirect rebuff to the United States, which offered similar help to Pakistan’s rival, India, in 2006 — a source of enduring resentment in Pakistan. \n \n Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari signed a deal with Iran last year to run a gas pipeline across the border to Pakistan. But the project would run afoul of United Nations sanctions on Iran — penalties that were championed by Washington. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The United States, for its part, has spent $225 million since 2009 in refurbishing Pakistan’s decrepit hydroelectric power plants, adding 900 megawatts to the national grid. American officials are also working with the government to improve revenue collection. \n \n But large-scale infrastructure projects, like new hydroelectric dams, take years to come to fruition. And international donors are reluctant to commit further funds without signs of strong reform from Pakistan’s political leadership. \n \n Pakistan’s leaders know they are running out of time. Other countries also face crippling electricity shortages, of course, in parts of the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa. But none of those nations possess nuclear weapons, or such a rapidly growing population as Pakistan, estimated at 180 million people. \n \n Population growth alone is adding 1,000 megawatts per year to the country’s electricity needs, said Mr. Hathaway of the Wilson Center. \n \n “We Americans also like to defer tough decisions,” he said, referring to contentious and expensive reforms in education and social welfare. “But Pakistanis are approaching a point where they no longer have that luxury.”"", 'Study Puts Puerto Rico Death Toll From Hurricane Maria Near 5,000 \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images \n \n Updated 12:43 p.m. ET \n \n Perhaps 5,000 people died in Puerto Rico in 2017 for reasons related to September\'s Hurricane Maria, according to a study that dismisses the official death toll of 64 as ""a substantial underestimate."" \n \n A research team led by scientists at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health didn\'t simply attempt to count dead bodies in the wake of the powerful storm. Instead, they surveyed randomly chosen households and asked the occupants about their experiences. \n \n From that approach, they concluded that between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017, there were 4,645 ""excess deaths"" — that is, deaths that would not have occurred if the island hadn\'t been plunged into a prolonged disaster following the devastating storm. \n \n But the estimate isn\'t as precise as the figure implies.The researchers calculate a statistical term called a 95 percent confidence interval, which encompasses a broad range – from 800 to 8,500 deaths. Their figure of 4,645 lies near the middle of that range, and they round up to something over 5,000 to account for some assumptions they made. \n \n The findings were published Tuesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. \n \n The research team randomly selected 3,299 households in Puerto Rico. Local scientists surveyed them over the course of three weeks in January. People in those homes reported a total of 38 deaths. The scientists then extrapolated that finding to the island\'s total population of 3.4 million people to estimate the number of deaths. The researchers then subtracted deaths recorded during that same period in 2016 and concluded that the mortality rate in Puerto Rico had jumped 62 percent in the three months following the storm. \n \n The death rate is a contentious subject, in part because federal and island governments haven\'t responded as rapidly to the disaster as they have in other hurricane emergencies. The study notes that 83 percent of the households in Puerto Rico were without electrical power for the time period looked at, more than 100 days, from the date of the hurricane until the end of 2017. \n \n Puerto Rico residents and outside observers have long argued that the official death toll is hopelessly inadequate. It captures the number of deaths the medical examiner attributed directly to the storm — the high water and howling winds in the worst natural disaster on record for the U.S. territory. Maria came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds gusting at over 110 mph and drenching rainfall. \n \n CNN surveyed funeral homes after the storm and tallied 499 hurricane-related deaths. The New York Times compared official death records from September and October 2017 and identified more than 1,000 excess deaths, compared with the average for 2015 and 2016. Alexis Santos, a researcher at Penn State University, and a colleague, used death certificates to come up with a similar estimate. \n \n The government of Puerto Rico commissioned researchers from George Washington University\'s Milken Institute School of Public Health to estimate excess deaths. Results of that study have been delayed and are due out this summer. ""We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported,"" said Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration. He says that\'s why it commissioned the study from GW. ""Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost."" \n \n Caroline Buckee, a lead author of the news and epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says, ""Our approach is complementary to that and it provides a different kind of estimate and a different kind of insight into the impact of the hurricane."" The researchers suggested that the government in Puerto Rico could use its methods in an even larger survey to reduce the large uncertainties in their findings. \n \n The Harvard study covers a greater time period than The New York Times\' calculation, a difference that could partly account for the much higher figure. \n \n The household survey is a widely accepted technique for estimating casualties following a disaster. But it can be misleading if the sample isn\'t truly random or if some households have been wiped out altogether and are therefore missing from the survey. In the latter, the result would underestimate the true toll. In fact, the Harvard team says its results are ""likely to be an underestimate"" because of this bias. \n \n National Communication Issues In Puerto Rico Make It Hard To Register Deaths Communication Issues In Puerto Rico Make It Hard To Register Deaths Listen · 4:04 4:04 \n \n The survey looked at deaths through the end of 2017, but the scientists suspect that the excess deaths continued into this year. ""We saw consistent, high rates, in September, October, November, December,"" says Rafael Irizarry, a biostatistician on the research team. ""There\'s no reason to think that on Jan. 1 this trend stops."" \n \n ""Hurricane Maria caused massive infrastructural damage to Puerto Rico,"" the Harvard team writes in its study. \n \n ""In our survey, interruption of medical care was the primary cause of sustained high mortality rates in the months following the hurricane,"" the wrote. Hospitals and doctors struggled to provide care, and many people simply had trouble getting to the doctor or the hospital to seek medical care. The survey finds that one-third of the total deaths in the months following the storm were caused by delayed or interrupted health care. \n \n Understanding the true number is important for many reasons.

The weird order goes hand in hand with another edict that forbids government offices from turning on their air-conditioners. That makes things so unbearably hot that the workers are barred from wearing shoes and socks lest they be tempted to reach for the AC. Instead, bare feet in sandals or moccasins are required. If it sounds like desperation, that's because it is. Even in major cities, electricity goes down for 10 hours a day, reports the New York Times, and it's not hard to imagine all the disastrous ways that ripples through society—at hospitals, morgues, factories that can't run their equipment, etc. All kinds of factors are at play, but the Times zeroes in on a surprisingly simple one: ""Most Pakistanis will not pay their bills.""

155,"[""North Korean soldiers keep a watch toward the south as it rains during a ceremony marking the 63rd anniversary of the signing of the Korean War cease-fire armistice agreement at the truce village of Panmunjom,... (Associated Press) \n \n SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean police found about 200 lapel pins bearing the image of late North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il strewn near the country's main international airport on Thursday, police officers said. \n \n Police were analyzing security cameras to find how the 196 lapel pins ended up in a flowerbed of a hotel close to Incheon International Airport, just west of Seoul, according to a local police officer who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media on the matter. \n \n He gave no further details, but South Korean media said police were looking at a possibility that the lapel pins may have been carried by propaganda balloons that North Korea floated across the border. \n \n The possession of such lapel pins would be illegal in South Korea, where praising North Korea is punishable by up to seven years in prison. North Korea, for its part, enforces strict, state-organized public reverence of the Kim family, which has ruled the impoverished yet authoritarian country since its foundation in 1948. \n \n All North Koreans must wear lapel pins carrying the images of both Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung or the images of either of them. Portraits of the two Kims hang in public buildings and homes, and their birthdays are the two most important holidays in North Korea. \n \n South Korean officials said they haven't received any reports that North Korea has produced a lapel pin for current leader Kim Jong Un, who took power after his father Kim Jong Il's death in late 2011. \n \n A lapel pin with images of both Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is considered more valuable than other pins because it's the one given to government and military officials and diplomats. Some ordinary citizens buy that pin at unauthorized street markets, according to defectors and activists in Seoul. A Kim Il Sung pin is more used by citizens than a Kim Jong Il pin, they said. \n \n The rival Koreas restarted Cold War-era psychological warfare after the North's fourth nuclear test in January. Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang responded by its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. \n \n The rivals are divided along the world's most heavily fortified border since their war in the early 1950s ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty."", 'SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea is stepping up its propaganda campaign ahead of annual U.S.-South Korea war games next month, saying the peninsula is “on the verge of war.” \n \n Such rhetoric is common from Pyongyang at times of crisis; the current standoff began with the North’s fourth nuclear test in January and shows no signs of easing. Pyongyang has carried out a series of missile tests in recent months and made repeated threats that it is ready to attack South Korea and U.S. bases in the Pacific while pursuing the capability to hit the American mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile. \n \n South Korea accused Pyongyang of floating propaganda leaflets down the Han River earlier this week. The military discovered dozens of plastic bags, each carrying about 20 leaflets, near the river’s estuary, close to the tense Korean border last Friday, the South’s Defense Ministry said. \n \n Police also have launched an investigation after nearly 200 lapel pins bearing the image of late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il turned up in a flowerbed near Incheon International Airport. Police recovered the coin-sized pins Thursday morning after a hotel employee reported there were North Korean propaganda leaflets in the flowerbed, said an officer who asked to remain anonymous. \n \n Mere possession of the pins, which are mandatory accessories for all adults in North Korea, wouldn’t be considered a crime in the South; however, distribution of propaganda items would violate South Korea’s National Security Law, the officer said. \n \n Kim Jong Il, who ruled North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011, was the son of the country’s founder, Kim Il Sung, and the father of current leader Kim Jong Un. \n \n The lapel-pin find comes a day after the 63rd anniversary of the signing of an armistice that ended fighting during the Korean War. Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said during a Wednesday ceremony at the Demilitarized Zone that, without the armistice, many incidents that have happened over the years — such as the August maiming of two South Korean soldiers by a mine reportedly planted by the North just before the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises — could have reignited war on the peninsula. \n \n “Without the agreement and its buffers, we would almost have certainly seen several of the provocations, the provocative border skirmishes of the past six decades, spread like wildfire into larger battles,” he said. \n \n On Thursday, North Korea’s top diplomat for U.S. affairs, Han Song Ryol, told The Associated Press that Washington “crossed the red line” and effectively declared war by adding Kim to a sanctions list. \n \n Ryol said recent U.S. actions — likely including a decision to station a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, in the southeastern region of Seongju — have put the peninsula on the verge of war, and that a vicious showdown could erupt if the U.S. and South Korea go ahead with annual war games planned for next month. \n \n The leaflets contained threats to launch missile attacks and a repeat of the North’s long-running propaganda, such as claims that it won the 1950-53 Korean War, according to a ministry official quoted by the AP. \n \n The propaganda incidents may be retaliation for South Korean propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers at the border that resumed after North Korea’s fourth underground nuclear test in January. The North has been broadcasting its own propaganda across the DMZ and launching anti-South leaflets over the border via balloons, the AP reported. \n \n chang.kyong@stripes.com']",2,"– North Korea has apparently kicked off a new propaganda war ahead of planned war games between the US and South Korea next month. South Korea says its military found hundreds of propaganda leaflets floating down a river near the border last week, boasting that the North won the Korean War and threatening missile attacks, reports the AP. Some 200 flag-shaped lapel pins featuring a photo of Kim Jong Il were also discovered in a hotel flowerbed near Incheon International Airport on Thursday, reports Stars and Stripes. These are no ordinary pins: As Atlas Obscura explains, they're a patriotic symbol distributed by North Korea's Workers' Party to be worn by all adults on the left side of the chest. Some say Kim Jong Un's wife disappeared after failing to wear one in public. Other versions feature Kim Il Sung, and a rare few show both former leaders. These are only given to high-ranking government officials and military leaders, though ordinary citizens can get a knock-off version from China on the black market. North Koreans were even using the pins in place of cash before the Workers' Party made it illegal. Police are investigating how the pins got into the flowerbed as possession of such items is illegal in South Korea, but say they may have arrived via a propaganda balloon. Meanwhile, Pyongyang accuses the South of releasing snakes across the border ""as part of a 'cunning scheme' to challenge our unity,"" reports the Guardian. A diplomat also promises action if the war games go ahead as planned, noting the US ""crossed the red line"" when putting Kim on a sanctions list."

Shourd, who was freed last year and is engaged to Bauer, was on hand in Oman to greet the two as they ran down the stairs from the private plane that picked them up in Iran and flew them to freedom. \n \n “We’re so happy we are free,” Fattal told reporters at Muscat International Airport in Oman. \n \n “Two years in prison is too long,” Bauer said. He expressed hope that Wednesday’s release would lead to “freedom for political prisoners in America and Iran.” After making their brief statements, Bauer and Fattal left the airport with their families. \n \n The release came a day before Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly in New York, and it seemed timed at least in part as a goodwill gesture ahead of the speech. \n \n “We are thrilled,” said President Obama, also in New York for the U.N. session, after being informed of the release. He told reporters it was a “wonderful day” for the two men’s families “and for us.” \n \n In a statement issued later by the White House, Obama praised “the tireless advocacy” of the families. He also expressed gratitude to Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said, the ruler of the tiny monarchy on the Arabian Peninsula, and to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, the Swiss government and others around the world “who have worked steadfastly over the past two years to secure the release of Shane and Josh.” \n \n A convoy of official cars left Tehran’s notorious Evin prison about 6:30 p.m. local time (10 a.m. in Washington), the government-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency reported. \n \n The plane carrying the hikers left Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport and arrived in Oman about 3:40 p.m. Washington time. \n \n The two men raced down the aircraft’s stairs to embrace family members waiting on the tarmac, television images showed. \n \n Both men were surrounded by journalists and U.S. Embassy officials, as Bauer hugged Shourd, who was released from Evin prison in September 2010 on medical grounds. \n \n “Today can only be described as the best day of our lives,” the family members said in a joint statement reported by the Associated Press. “We have waited for nearly 26 months for this moment,” it added. “We now all want nothing more than to wrap Shane and Josh in our arms, catch up on two lost years and make a new beginning, for them and for all of us.” \n \n Masoud Shafiei, an Iranian lawyer representing Bauer and Fattal, spent two hours inside the prison complex earlier in the day completing paperwork for the Americans’ release. He told the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency that the government of Oman had paid $1 million bail for Bauer and Fattal. Oman also reportedly paid bail last year to secure the release of Shourd. \n \n After signing the papers, Shafiei waited outside the prison with the Swiss ambassador to Iran, Livia Leu Agosti, who represents U.S. interests in the country because Washington and Tehran do not have diplomatic relations. \n \n When two Iranian government cars left the prison complex, presumably with the Americans inside, Shafiei and Agosti sped after them. \n \n Bauer and Fattal were convicted of espionage charges in a closed trial last month. They denied being spies, maintaining that if they crossed the Iranian border, they did so accidentally while hiking with Shourd. \n \n Ahmadinejad told journalists from The Washington Post and NBC News last week that Bauer and Fattal would receive a “unilateral pardon” and would be home “within days.” \n \n The next day, Iran’s judiciary, which is led by Shiite Muslim clerics who once supported Ahmadinejad but now oppose him, reacted angrily, stressing that Ahmadinejad did not have the authority to free the men. \n \n On Sunday, the men’s release was delayed again because one of the judges whose signature is required on the bail paperwork was on vacation. Shafiei said that he had received the second signature Wednesday morning. \n \n The controversy over the hikers was the dominant backdrop as Ahmadinejad headed to New York on Monday to participate in the annual U.N. General Assembly session. \n \n News of the release was welcomed Wednesday by officials from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, who were part of a delegation of U.S. religious leaders and American Muslims who traveled to Iran to ask that the hikers be allowed to leave. \n \n “We believe the efforts of the recent interfaith delegation to Iran offer a positive example of bridge-building initiatives that may be undertaken to help promote mutual understanding and cooperation between nations,” CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement. “We hope our government will now address the issue of Iranian citizens detained in the United States with the same spirit of compassion.” \n \n Staff writer William Branigin in Washington contributed to this report.']",2,"– After being jailed for more than two years, American hikers Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal walked out of Evin prison free men this morning, confirms Iranian state television.

(Associated Press) \n \n QUEBEC CITY (AP) — A French Canadian suspect known for his far-right, nationalist views was charged Monday with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder in the shooting rampage at a Quebec City mosque that Canada\'s prime minister called an act of terrorism again Muslims. \n \n Alexandre Bissonnette made a brief court appearance and did not enter a plea in the attack that left six people dead during evening prayers Sunday. Wearing a white prisoner jump suit, his hands and feet shackled, he stared down at the floor and fidgeted, but did not speak. \n \n The 27-year-old suspect, who has espoused support for the French far-right party of Marine Le Pen and had liked U.S. President Donald Trump on his Facebook page, was known to those who monitor extremist groups in Quebec, said François Deschamps, an official with a refugee advocacy group. ""It\'s with pain and anger that we learn the identity of terrorist Alexandre Bissonnette, unfortunately known to many activists in Quebec for taking nationalist, pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social media,"" Deschamps wrote on the Facebook page of the group, Bienvenues aux Refugiés, or Welcome to Refugees. \n \n An anthropology and political science major at Laval University in Quebec City, Bissonnette had also expressed support on his Facebook profile for ""Génération Nationale,"" a group whose manifesto includes the rejection of ""multiculturalism."" \n \n More than 50 people were at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre when the shooting erupted. In addition to the six dead, 19 people were wounded — all men. Of the five victims who remained hospitalized, two were in critical condition, authorities said. The dead ranged in age from 39 to 60. \n \n Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard both characterized the attack as a terrorist act, which came amid heightened tensions worldwide over Trump\'s travel ban on seven Muslim countries. Le Pen, leader of the National Front in France, is known for her anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant positions and has won the endorsement and admiration of white supremacists. \n \n Canada is generally welcoming toward immigrants and all religions, but the French-speaking province of Quebec has had a long-simmering debate about race and religious accommodation. The previous separatist government of the province called for a ban on ostentatious religious symbols, such as the hijab, in public institutions. \n \n Trudeau said in Parliament the victims were targeted simply because of their religion and spoke directly to the more than 1 million Muslims who live in Canada, saying, ""We are with you."" \n \n ""Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours,"" Trudeau said. ""Know that we value you."" \n \n The prime minister later attended a vigil outside the mosque. \n \n The suspect was arrested in his car on a bridge near d\'Orleans, where he called 911 to say he wanted to cooperate with police. Authorities, who initially named two suspects, said the other man taken into custody was a witness to the attack and was released earlier Monday. They said they did not believe there were other suspects but were investigating. \n \n Police did not give a motive for the attack. \n \n Trump called Trudeau to express condolences to the Canadian people and to offer any assistance that might be needed. \n \n The White House pointed to the attack as an example of why Trump\'s policies were needed. ""We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms. It\'s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be pro-active, rather than reactive when it comes to our nation\'s safety and security,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. \n \n The victims were businessmen, a university professor and others who had gathered for evening prayers, said Mohamed Labidi, the vice president of the mosque. \n \n ""\'It\'s a very, very big tragedy for us,"" Labidi said tearfully. ""We have a sadness we cannot express."" \n \n He said the victims were shot in the back. ""Security at our mosque was our major, major concern,"" he said. ""But we were caught off guard."" \n \n The shooting took place just before 8 p.m. Sunday. Witnesses described chaos as worshippers scrambled to find friends and loved ones, as police responding to the scene called for backup. \n \n Couillard said he would ""not go there"" when asked if he blamed recent rhetoric in in the U.S. for the attack. \n \n ""Quebec is a good, generally loving society, but we have these devils as other societies have. We have to recognize that and fight them,"" Couillard said at a news conference in Quebec City at which he and Muslim leaders held hands in a display of solidarity. \n \n ""The Muslim community was the target of this murderous attack,"" Couillard said, adding that solidarity rallies would be held across Quebec later Monday. \n \n The mosque has been a target of hate crimes in the past, including last summer when pig\'s head was left on its doorstep during Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Practicing Muslims do not eat pork. \n \n Quebec City Mayor Regis Labeaume, appearing shaken, said: ""No person should have to pay with their life, for their race, their color, their sexual orientation or their religious beliefs."" \n \n Worshipper Ali Hamadi said he left the mosque a few minutes before the shooting and a friend, Abdelkrim Hassen, was killed. He said Hassen, who worked in information technology for the government, had three daughters and a wife, whom he had to notify of the death. \n \n Majdi Dridi of the Muslim Association of Canada said he knew two of the victims. One was a work colleague who was a father of three little girls, he said. \n \n ""I don\'t know what to say, I just hope that his family and his children can have the patience to accept what happened,"" Dridi said \n \n Trudeau had earlier reacted to Trump\'s visa ban for people from some Muslim-majority countries by tweeting Saturday: ""To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada."" \n \n Trudeau also posted a picture of himself greeting a Syrian child at Toronto\'s airport in late 2015. Trudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected. \n \n The mayor of Gatineau, Quebec, near Canada\'s capital of Ottawa, said there would be an increased police presence at mosques around his city following the attack. The New York Police Department also said it was stepping up patrols at mosques and other houses of worship. \n \n ___ \n \n Gillies reported from Toronto.

He was also a cadet as a child. \n \n Neighbours of Bissonnette\'s parents said he was renting an apartment with his twin brother near the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec, where the shooting took place Sunday evening. \n \n Neighbour Réjean Bussière said Bissonnette was very introverted. \n \n ""He\'s a very closed-off young man,"" Bussière told CBC\'s French-language network, Radio-Canada. \n \n Only 1 suspected shooter \n \n Another man, Mohamed Belkhadir, was arrested outside the mosque within minutes of the shooting. He was released after police confirmed he was a witness and not involved in the shooting. \n \n He said he had been shovelling snow when he heard gunshots — when they stopped he entered the mosque to call 911. \n \n ""I saw the image of someone with a firearm, I didn\'t know it was police. I thought it was a shooter who\'d returned,"" Belkhadir told Radio-Canada. \n \n The man fled and police arrested him. He was released Monday. \n \n Shortly after noon Monday, provincial police said that man was no longer a suspect, but rather a witness to the attack. \n \n A half-hour after the shooting, Quebec City police Insp.

The suspect followed several profiles that espouse right-wing ideologies, including that of Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of France\'s National Front. \n \n A search was conducted at the home of Bissonnette\'s parents on du Tracel Street in Cap-Rouge, as well as at a residence on des Quatre-Bourgeois Road, closer to the mosque. \n \n A woman who identified herself as a neighbour of Bissonnette\'s parents said the suspect had recently moved into an apartment that he was renting with his twin brother, not far from the mosque where the shooting occurred. \n \n ""He is a child,"" she said.

Bestselling author J.K. Rowling was one of those voices. \n \n Earlier Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack a ""despicable act of terror.""', 'QUEBEC CITY/TORONTO (Reuters) - A French-Canadian university student was the sole suspect in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque and was charged with the premeditated murder of six people, Canadian authorities said on Monday, in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called “a terrorist attack.” \n \n Court documents identified the gunman in the attack on Sunday evening prayers as Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, and charged him with six murder counts and five counts of attempted murder with a restricted weapon. The slightly-built Bissonnette made a brief appearance in court under tight security wearing a white prison garment and looking downcast. \n \n Prosecutors said all of the evidence was not yet ready and Bissonnette, a student at Université Laval, was set to appear again on Feb. 21. No charge was read in court and Bissonnette did not enter a plea. \n \n “The charges laid correspond to the evidence available,” said Thomas Jacques, a representative of the prosecutor’s office, when asked why Bissonnette was not charged with terrorism-related offences. \n \n Among the six men killed were a butcher, a university professor, a pharmacist and an accountant, according to police and Canadian media. \n \n The government of Guinea said in a statement that two of its citizens were among those killed in the mosque attack. \n \n Police declined to discuss possible motives for the shooting at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec. \n \n “They consider this a lone wolf situation,” a Canadian source familiar with the situation said. \n \n In Washington, U.S. government security experts were leaning to the view that the gunman most likely was motivated by hatred for Muslims, a U.S. government source familiar with official reporting said. \n \n Trudeau, who has made a point of welcoming refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, told parliament in Ottawa: “Make no mistake, this was a terrorist attack.” \n \n “Last night this community experienced something that no community should ever have to know: Unspeakable cruelty and violence perpetrated on those who came together in friendship and in faith,” Trudeau said later at a vigil attended by hundreds who braved frigid temperatures in Quebec City. \n \n He added a personal message to Canada’s 1 million Muslims: \n \n “We stand with you. We love you and we support you and we will always defend and protect your right to gather together and pray today and every day,” Trudeau added. \n \n Alexandre Bissonnette, a suspect in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque, is seen in a Facebook posting. Facebook/Handout via REUTERS \n \n The attack was out of character for Quebec City, a city of just over 500,000 which reported just two murders in all of 2015. Mass shootings are rare in Canada, where gun control laws are stricter than in the United States. \n \n Incidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years. The face-covering, or niqab, became an issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election, especially in Quebec, where the majority of the population supported a ban on it at citizenship ceremonies. \n \n In addition to the six killed, five people were critically injured and 12 were treated for minor injuries, a spokeswoman for the Quebec City University Hospital said. \n \n Federal Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters in Ottawa there was no change to “the national terrorism threat level” from medium because “there is no information known to the government of Canada that would lead to a change at this time.” \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump called Trudeau to express his condolences “and offered to provide any assistance as needed,” said Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad. \n \n Over the weekend, Trudeau said Canada would welcome refugees, his response to an executive order by Trump on Friday to halt the U.S. refugee program and to temporarily bar citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. \n \n Trump’s action, which the president said was “not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe,” was widely condemned in the United States and abroad as targeting Muslims. \n \n On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that the Quebec shooting was “a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive, rather than reactive, when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” \n \n FATHER OF FOUR KILLED \n \n A father of four, the owner of a halal butcher near the mosque, was among those killed, said Pamela Sakinah El-hayet, a friend of one of the people at the mosque. \n \n The mosque concierge was killed, as was Ahmed Youness, a 21-year-old student, El-hayet told Reuters. One of El-hayet’s friends, Youness’ roommate, was in the mosque at the time of the shooting. He was unharmed, she said, but in total shock. \n \n A man of Moroccan descent who had also been arrested was now considered a witness, although his nationality was not immediately known, a Canadian source familiar with the situation said. \n \n Ali Assafiri, a student at Université Laval, said he had been running late for the evening prayers at the mosque, near the university in the Quebec City area. When he arrived, the mosque had been transformed by police into a crime scene. \n \n Slideshow (16 Images) \n \n “Everyone was in shock,” Assafiri said by phone. “It was chaos.” \n \n Vigils were planned for Montreal and Quebec City, the provincial capital, as well as in Edmonton. There was an outpouring of support for the mosque on social media.']",3,"– Authorities in Canada think Sunday night's mosque shooting that left six people dead is a ""lone wolf situation,"" reports Reuters, and they think they've got their shooter: Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, appeared in court Monday and was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder, reports CBC News. So far, he does not face any terrorism-related charges. Bissonnette attended Laval University, near the Quebec City mosque, and studied political science and anthropology. The AP reports that he was known to espouse ""far-right nationalist views"" online, and the Toronto Globe and Mail reports that this didn't begin until March when nationalist leader Marine Le Pen visited Quebec City. ""I wrote him off as a xenophobe,"" says a fellow Laval student. ""He was enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement."" A member of a refugee advocacy group says Bissonnette had become a familiar name to those who monitor extremist groups. He was ""unfortunately known to many activists in Quebec for taking nationalist, pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social media,"" François Deschamps wrote on the Facebook page of the group Welcome to Refugees, per the Montreal Gazette. Five victims of the shooting remained hospitalized as of Monday evening."

MUST WATCH Be prepared for bad weather 00:59 PLAY VIDEO \n \n Here\'s a look at what winter\'s bringing around the country: \n \n Who\'s getting hit worst? \n \n For snow and ice, parts of the Midwest and Northeast in a band running from Illinois east all the way to Maine. For cold temperatures, it\'s the nation\'s midsection, from Montana east to Wisconsin all the way south to northern Texas. \n \n What\'s the forecast? \n \n It\'s going to be awfully cold in the Plains and High Plains -- as much as 40 degrees below average in some places, according to the National Weather Service. In Helena, Montana, for instance, Wednesday\'s high is forecast to be 3 degrees below zero. That compares with 2 degrees on Tuesday and the average high of 36. \n \n Snowy, icy conditions are expected from eastern Missouri into the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. Up to 2 inches of snow per hour may fall around Boston, with as much as a foot of snow predicted in parts of Massachusetts. \n \n Who\'s being affected? \n \n In New York, where heavy snows are taxing salt reserves, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared an emergency for the entire state and shut down Interstate 84. \n \n ""New Yorkers in affected regions should stay off the roads, check on their neighbors and loved ones, and stay inside their homes until the worst of the storm has passed,"" he said in a statement. \n \n Transportation regulators waived rest rules for salt-truck drivers to get remaining salt stockpiles moved to where they are needed: New York City and Long Island. \n \n In Pennsylvania, Villanova University announced that it would be closed Thursday and Friday after the school\'s power provider projected an extended outage in the area. \n \n And in Kansas, authorities announced a third weather-related death from the storm: a 58-year-old man died overnight after a traffic accident Tuesday, the Kansas Highway Patrol said. \n \n In Boston, the weather seemed little nuisance. \n \n CNN iReporter Jenifer Schwartz, visiting from California, marveled at how the city handled the storm. \n \n ""My flight home today is one of the many that was canceled, but getting a cab this morning to get to meetings around the city did not prove to be too much of a problem,"" she said. \n \n Relative Boston newcomer and native Southerner Josh Parsons was just trying to process it all. \n \n ""Since this is my first winter in the North, the snow still feels like a novelty to me,"" he told CNN on Wednesday. ""I enjoy seeing it falling and enjoy walking around in it right after the fresh snow. Having said that, I do not like some of the things that come along with the snow."" \n \n Such as? Salt, slush and the simple fact all the snow just won\'t go away. \n \n ""The roads get cleared, the sidewalks get cleared, but then there are just mounds or brown, dirty ice piled up everywhere,"" he said. \n \n Meanwhile, in Michigan, two Delta Air Lines aircraft got stuck in the snow in unrelated incidents at Detroit Metro Airport. \n \n This comes a day after a Southwest Airlines plane hit a snowbank as it was taxiing to a gate in Kansas City, Missouri, according to airline spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger. \n \n Nationwide, airlines had canceled nearly 2,800 flights, according to flight tracking website Flightaware.com. \n \n Most-affected among major airports include New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty International, New York\'s LaGuardia and Boston Logan International. \n \n The Federal Aviation Administration also reported significant delays at airports in Chicago, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina. \n \n Why all the severe weather this winter? \n \n Boston is about 8 inches ahead of its normal snowfall pace for the year, the National Weather Service said. In New York, the number is 23 inches. \n \n It\'s not unusual or unprecedented, Radley Horton, a climate scientist with Columbia University, told CNN\'s New Day. \n \n ""If we look at winters in the past, we can get this kind of setup with a very wavy jet stream. Colder air spills into one side (while) the other side of the country has extremely warm weather,"" he said. \n \n But climate change -- particularly the way melting Arctic sea ice may be affecting jet stream patterns -- could be increasing the frequency and severity of such wild weather rides, he said. \n \n ""There\'s always going to be variability,"" Horton said. ""There\'s always going to be these waves in the jet stream. But it does seem, according to some research, as we lose that sea ice in the Arctic, one possible surprise could be more cold air spilling south, more warm air going north.""', 'East Coast Weekend Snow May Come in Two Waves \n \n By By Alex Sosnowski, senior meteorologist. February 06, 2014, 5:49:29 AM EST \n \n As the latest winter storm delivers a swath of snow reaching more than 1,500 miles at midweek, another snowstorm is being monitored for this weekend. \n \n The timing of the storm as it travels from the Rockies and Southwest is Saturday to Sunday over the Central states and Sunday to Monday in the East. \n \n The upcoming storm could be the most intense, and correspondingly the most disruptive, of the recent barrage especially as the storm nears and moves along the Atlantic coast. \n \n @erikmwalker tweeted: ""More news is snow news? Some computer models say flurries Sunday night; Others predict doom-filled epic storm"" Additional Relevant Tweets and Social Media Reaction \n \n This is provided the storm does not have competition with another storm nearby. \n \n The snow this weekend could affect major hubs in the East, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Washington and Boston into Monday\'s morning commute. \n \n Many airlines may still be trying to catch up and get back on schedule in the wake of the recent storms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Single-Storm Scenario \n \n One scenario suggests the storm may develop into a blizzard as it nears the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, people from Virginia to Maine will need to watch this one carefully. \n \n If the storm develops to its full potential along the mid-Atlantic coast, it may deliver not only snowfall rates of several inches per hour to inland areas of the Northeast, but also strong winds. \n \n RELATED: \n \n AccuWeather.com Winter Weather Center \n \n Latest Watches, Warnings, Advisories \n \n Sneaky Snow Possible in the East Saturday \n \n These winds would cause extensive blowing and drifting snow over the central Appalachians to New England with local whiteout conditions. A period of strong onshore winds would bring coastal flooding and beach erosion over the upper mid-Atlantic to eastern New England. A return flow from the west would bring cold air back in quickly to the coast. \n \n New England and the Maritimes have the best chance of a period of windswept snow Sunday into Monday. \n \n The Two-Storm Scenario \n \n Another scenario would be for the storm to behave more like other storms have done recently with a period of light to moderate snow streaking across part of the Midwest to part of the Northeast. Winds would be significantly less and probably not a factor. Overall, a more manageable snowfall would occur. \n \n Supporting this less intense storm idea on Sunday to Monday is a front-running and weaker storm that will roll across the South on Friday night with rain showers and then could brush the Northeast on Saturday with a swath of snow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Recall that a similar sneaky storm brought over 6 inches of snow to parts of the Northeast this past Monday. \n \n According to Senior Meteorologist Mark Mancuso, ""With so many storms on the playing field, the atmosphere may not have the energy available to allow the Sunday to Monday storm to become a major event until it has bypassed the United States."" \n \n With this latter scenario, there would be two weaker storms, rather than one very strong system. \n \n Either way, it appears another episode of travel disruptions and concern for daily activities will sweep from the Central states to the East Coast. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In both scenarios, rain would fall across the Deep South and some snow would sweep across part of the southern Plains during Saturday night and the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians on Sunday. A period of snow would also streak eastward across the Midwest cities of St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati and Cleveland. \n \n However, a stronger storm would imply more thunderstorm activity and a greater risk for severe weather in part of the Southeastern states. \n \n The details on the nature of storm for this weekend will unfold in the coming days. \n \n More Storms Beyond This Weekend \n \n According to Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity, ""The Sunday to Monday weather event will not mark an end to the stormy pattern. Additional storms are on deck through at least the middle of February."" \n \n Another storm may affect part of the eastern third of the nation with snow and rain around Valentine\'s Day. \n \n Report a Typo', 'More than 3,000 flights were cancelled after the Northeast was socked Wednesday with a winter storm packing snow, freezing rain and ice. \n \n The storm, which arrived after causing similar havoc in the Midwest the day before, left anywhere from a few inches to a foot -- or more -- of snow up the coast, along with the freezing rain that makes driving treacherous. \n \n The inclement weather adds to what\'s already been a weary winter for the Northeast, and comes days after a major winter storm buried some parts of the region in nearly a foot of snow. \n \n The website FlightAware.com said 3,198 flights were cancelled on Wednesday, along with nearly 12,000 delays. \n \n Most of the cancelled flights were from the New York-area airports, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington. Regional airline Cape Air alone cancelled more than 200 flights, including nearly every flight planned from airports in Massachusetts. \n \n Along with travel disruptions, the storm also cut electricity to hundreds of thousands of customers in the region. Nearly 750,000 customers in Pennsylvania were left in the dark by the storm\'s wrath, with a major utility company telling residents power could remain out until the weekend. \n \n In Connecticut, the start of the state\'s General Assembly annual session was delayed until Thursday due to the snow. Nearly a foot of snow buried Massachusetts, schools were largely cancelled across Rhode Island, and rail service out of Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon was limited. \n \n Across the nation, residents struggled to carry on despite the storm. \n \n ""I wish that groundhog would have stayed in its hole,"" said Geoff Dunn, who took the bus to his downtown Columbus, Ohio, office, avoiding the messy roads but still having to navigate snowy sidewalks. ""Finding us six more weeks of winter was not the smart move."" \n \n In Chicago, a runner was credited with helping save a man who fell into icy Lake Michigan with his dog. \n \n Adam Dominik says he found twine and anchored it around himself while throwing the other end in the water, pulling the man onto nearby rocks. Meanwhile, a skier called 911. He was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe hypothermia. He and his dog are expected to recover. \n \n In Michigan, authorities reported several multi-vehicle crashes Wednesday after several inches of snow along Interstate 94 in the Jackson area, including some with injuries, and crashes closed portions of I-69 in the Flint area. \n \n And for those looking for a respite, more bad news is on the way, as authorities predict another walloping winter storm is poised to slam into the region Saturday night into Sunday. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.', ""The cables, a huge sampling of the daily traffic between the State Department and some 270 embassies and consulates, amount to a secret chronicle of the United States’ relations with the world in an age of war and terrorism. Among their revelations, to be detailed in The Times in coming days: \n \n ¶ A dangerous standoff with Pakistan over nuclear fuel: Since 2007, the United States has mounted a highly secret effort, so far unsuccessful, to remove from a Pakistani research reactor highly enriched uranium that American officials fear could be diverted for use in an illicit nuclear device. In May 2009, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson reported that Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts because, as a Pakistani official said, “if the local media got word of the fuel removal, ‘they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan’s nuclear weapons,’ he argued.” \n \n ¶ Thinking about an eventual collapse of North Korea: American and South Korean officials have discussed the prospects for a unified Korea, should the North’s economic troubles and political transition lead the state to implode. The South Koreans even considered commercial inducements to China, according to the American ambassador to Seoul. She told Washington in February that South Korean officials believe that the right business deals would “help salve” China’s “concerns about living with a reunified Korea” that is in a “benign alliance” with the United States. \n \n ¶ Bargaining to empty the Guantánamo Bay prison: When American diplomats pressed other countries to resettle detainees, they became reluctant players in a State Department version of “Let’s Make a Deal.” Slovenia was told to take a prisoner if it wanted to meet with President Obama, while the island nation of Kiribati was offered incentives worth millions of dollars to take in Chinese Muslim detainees, cables from diplomats recounted. The Americans, meanwhile, suggested that accepting more prisoners would be “a low-cost way for Belgium to attain prominence in Europe.” \n \n ¶ Suspicions of corruption in the Afghan government: When one of Afghanistan’s two vice presidents visited the United Arab Emirates last year, local authorities working with the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered that he was carrying $52 million in cash. With wry understatement, a cable from the American Embassy in Kabul called the money “a significant amount” that the official, Ahmed Zia Massoud, “was ultimately allowed to keep without revealing the money’s origin or destination.” (Mr. Massoud denies taking any money out of Afghanistan.) \n \n ¶ A global computer hacking effort: China’s Politburo directed the intrusion into Google’s computer systems in that country, a Chinese contact told the American Embassy in Beijing in January, one cable reported. The Google hacking was part of a coordinated campaign of computer sabotage carried out by government operatives, private security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government. They have broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002, cables said. \n \n ¶ Mixed records against terrorism: Saudi donors remain the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like Al Qaeda, and the tiny Persian Gulf state of Qatar, a generous host to the American military for years, was the “worst in the region” in counterterrorism efforts, according to a State Department cable last December. Qatar’s security service was “hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the U.S. and provoking reprisals,” the cable said. \n \n ¶ An intriguing alliance: American diplomats in Rome reported in 2009 on what their Italian contacts described as an extraordinarily close relationship between Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and business magnate, including “lavish gifts,” lucrative energy contracts and a “shadowy” Russian-speaking Italian go-between. They wrote that Mr. Berlusconi “appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of Putin” in Europe. The diplomats also noted that while Mr. Putin enjoyed supremacy over all other public figures in Russia, he was undermined by an unmanageable bureaucracy that often ignored his edicts. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n ¶ Arms deliveries to militants: Cables describe the United States’ failing struggle to prevent Syria from supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has amassed a huge stockpile since its 2006 war with Israel. One week after President Bashar al-Assad promised a top State Department official that he would not send “new” arms to Hezbollah, the United States complained that it had information that Syria was providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to the group. \n \n ¶ Clashes with Europe over human rights: American officials sharply warned Germany in 2007 not to enforce arrest warrants for Central Intelligence Agency officers involved in a bungled operation in which an innocent German citizen with the same name as a suspected militant was mistakenly kidnapped and held for months in Afghanistan. A senior American diplomat told a German official “that our intention was not to threaten Germany, but rather to urge that the German government weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the U.S.” \n \n The 251,287 cables, first acquired by WikiLeaks, were provided to The Times by an intermediary on the condition of anonymity. Many are unclassified, and none are marked “top secret,” the government’s most secure communications status. But some 11,000 are classified “secret,” 9,000 are labeled “noforn,” shorthand for material considered too delicate to be shared with any foreign government, and 4,000 are designated both secret and noforn. \n \n Many more cables name diplomats’ confidential sources, from foreign legislators and military officers to human rights activists and journalists, often with a warning to Washington: “Please protect” or “Strictly protect.” \n \n The Times, after consultations with the State Department, has withheld from articles and removed from documents it is posting online the names of some people who spoke privately to diplomats and might be at risk if they were publicly identified. The Times is also withholding some passages or entire cables whose disclosure could compromise American intelligence efforts. While the White House said it anticipated WikiLeaks would make public “several hundred thousand” cables Sunday night, the organization posted only 220 released and redacted by The Times and several European publications. \n \n The cables show that nearly a decade after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States’ relations with the world. They depict the Obama administration struggling to sort out which Pakistanis are trustworthy partners against Al Qaeda, adding Australians who have disappeared in the Middle East to terrorist watch lists, and assessing whether a lurking rickshaw driver in Lahore, Pakistan, was awaiting fares or conducting surveillance of the road to the American Consulate. \n \n They show officials managing relations with a China on the rise and a Russia retreating from democracy. They document years of effort to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon — and of worry about a possible Israeli strike on Iran with the same goal. \n \n Even when they recount events that are already known, the cables offer remarkable details. \n \n For instance, it has been previously reported that the Yemeni government has sought to cover up the American role in missile strikes against the local branch of Al Qaeda. But a cable’s fly-on-the-wall account of a January meeting between the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the American commander in the Middle East, is breathtaking. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “We’ll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours,” Mr. Saleh said, according to the cable sent by the American ambassador, prompting one of Yemen’s deputy prime ministers to “joke that he had just ‘lied’ by telling Parliament” that Yemen had carried out the strikes. \n \n Mr. Saleh, who at other times resisted American counterterrorism requests, was in a lighthearted mood. The authoritarian ruler of a conservative Muslim country, Mr. Saleh complains of smuggling from nearby Djibouti, but tells General Petraeus that his concerns are drugs and weapons, not whiskey, “provided it’s good whiskey.” \n \n Likewise, press reports detailed the unhappiness of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, when he was not permitted to set up his tent in Manhattan or to visit ground zero during a United Nations session last year. \n \n But the cables add a touch of scandal and alarm to the tale. They describe the volatile Libyan leader as rarely without the companionship of “his senior Ukrainian nurse,” described as “a voluptuous blonde.” They reveal that Colonel Qaddafi was so upset by his reception in New York that he balked at carrying out a promise to return dangerous enriched uranium to Russia. The American ambassador to Libya told Colonel Qaddafi’s son “that the Libyan government had chosen a very dangerous venue to express its pique,” a cable reported to Washington. \n \n The cables also disclose frank comments behind closed doors. Dispatches from early this year, for instance, quote the aging monarch of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah, as speaking scathingly about the leaders of Iraq and Pakistan. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The cable then mused about which seemed more likely. \n \n As he left Zimbabwe in 2007 after three years as ambassador, Christopher W. Dell wrote a sardonic account of Robert Mugabe, that country’s aging and erratic leader. The cable called him “a brilliant tactician” but mocked “his deep ignorance on economic issues (coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him the authority to suspend the laws of economics).” \n \n The possibility that a large number of diplomatic cables might become public has been discussed in government and media circles since May. That was when, in an online chat, an Army intelligence analyst, Pfc. Bradley Manning, described having downloaded from a military computer system many classified documents, including “260,000 State Department cables from embassies and consulates all over the world.” In an online discussion with Adrian Lamo, a computer hacker, Private Manning said he had delivered the cables and other documents to WikiLeaks. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Lamo reported Private Manning’s disclosures to federal authorities, and Private Manning was arrested. He has been charged with illegally leaking classified information and faces a possible court-martial and, if convicted, a lengthy prison term. \n \n In July and October, The Times, the British newspaper The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel published articles based on documents about Afghanistan and Iraq. Those collections were placed online by WikiLeaks, with selective redactions of the Afghan documents and much heavier redactions of the Iraq reports. \n \n Fodder for Historians \n \n Traditionally, most diplomatic cables remain secret for decades, providing fodder for historians only when the participants are long retired or dead. The State Department’s unclassified history series, titled “Foreign Relations of the United States,” has reached only 1976. \n \n While an overwhelming majority of the quarter-million cables provided to The Times are from the post-9/11 era, several hundred date from 1966 to the 1990s. Some show diplomats struggling to make sense of major events whose future course they could not guess. \n \n In a 1979 cable to Washington, Bruce Laingen, an American diplomat in Tehran, mused with a knowing tone about the Iranian revolution that had just occurred: “Perhaps the single dominant aspect of the Persian psyche is an overriding egoism,” Mr. Laingen wrote, offering tips on exploiting this psyche in negotiations with the new government. Less than three months later, Mr. Laingen and his colleagues would be taken hostage by radical Iranian students, hurling the Carter administration into crisis and, perhaps, demonstrating the hazards of diplomatic hubris. \n \n In 1989, an American diplomat in Panama City mulled over the options open to Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian leader, who was facing narcotics charges in the United States and intense domestic and international political pressure to step down. The cable called General Noriega “a master of survival”; its author appeared to have no inkling that one week later, the United States would invade Panama to unseat General Noriega and arrest him. \n \n In 1990, an American diplomat sent an excited dispatch from Cape Town: he had just learned from a lawyer for Nelson Mandela that Mr. Mandela’s 27-year imprisonment was to end. The cable conveys the momentous changes about to begin for South Africa, even as it discusses preparations for an impending visit from the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson. \n \n The voluminous traffic of more recent years — well over half of the quarter-million cables date from 2007 or later — show American officials struggling with events whose outcomes are far from sure. To read through them is to become a global voyeur, immersed in the jawboning, inducements and penalties the United States wields in trying to have its way with a recalcitrant world. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In an era of satellites and fiber-optic links, the cable retains the archaic name of an earlier technological era. It has long been the tool for the secretary of state to send orders to the field and for ambassadors and political officers to send their analyses to Washington. \n \n The cables have their own lexicon: “codel,” for a Congressional delegation; “visas viper,” for a report on a person considered dangerous; “démarche,” an official message to a foreign government, often a protest or warning. \n \n But the drama in the cables often comes from diplomats’ narratives of meetings with foreign figures, games of diplomatic poker in which each side is sizing up the other and neither is showing all its cards. \n \n Among the most fascinating examples recount American officials’ meetings in September 2009 and February 2010 with Ahmed Wali Karzai, the half brother of the Afghan president and a power broker in the Taliban’s home turf of Kandahar. \n \n They describe Mr. Karzai, “dressed in a crisp white shalwar kameez,” the traditional dress of loose tunic and trousers, appearing “nervous, though eager to express his views on the international presence in Kandahar,” and trying to win over the Americans with nostalgic tales about his years running a Chicago restaurant near Wrigley Field. \n \n But in midnarrative there is a stark alert for anyone reading the cable in Washington: “Note: While we must deal with AWK as the head of the Provincial Council, he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker.” (Mr. Karzai has denied such charges.) And the cables note statements by Mr. Karzai that the Americans, informed by a steady flow of eavesdropping and agents’ reports, believe to be false. \n \n A cable written after the February meeting coolly took note of the deceit on both sides. \n \n Mr. Karzai “demonstrated that he will dissemble when it suits his needs,” the cable said. “He appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities. We will need to monitor his activity closely, and deliver a recurring, transparent message to him” about the limits of American tolerance. \n \n Not All Business \n \n Even in places far from war zones and international crises, where the stakes for the United States are not as high, curious diplomats can turn out to be accomplished reporters, sending vivid dispatches to deepen the government’s understanding of exotic places. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In a 2006 account, a wide-eyed American diplomat describes the lavish wedding of a well-connected couple in Dagestan, in Russia’s Caucasus, where one guest is the strongman who runs the war-ravaged Russian republic of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. \n \n The diplomat tells of drunken guests throwing $100 bills at child dancers, and nighttime water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea. \n \n “The dancers probably picked upwards of USD 5000 off the cobblestones,” the diplomat wrote. The host later tells him that Ramzan Kadyrov “had brought the happy couple ‘a five-kilo lump of gold’ as his wedding present.” \n \n “After the dancing and a quick tour of the premises, Ramzan and his army drove off back to Chechnya,” the diplomat reported to Washington. “We asked why Ramzan did not spend the night in Makhachkala, and were told, ‘Ramzan never spends the night anywhere.’ ”""]",4,"– Little relief for the Northeast after a snowstorm Monday: Today, it's facing another winter storm, one that's already canceled some 2,400 flights, Fox News reports. Snowfall will range between a few inches in some areas, including New York City and Pittsburgh, to more than a foot in the Catskills and parts of New England. The ""norm,"" per CNN, will be eight to 12 inches, with snowfall slowing in the afternoon. Ice is also expected in many areas, with New York City facing half an inch. In the Philadelphia area, more than 500,000 are without power, Philly.com reports. Areas across New England are closing schools. More snow could also hit Illinois and Iowa, with ice and freezing rain in Mississippi. Some 120 million people may be affected, CNN notes.

160,"['We begin with the three words everyone writing about the election must say: Nobody knows anything. Everyone’s guessing. I spent Sunday morning in Washington with journalists and political hands, one of whom said she feels it’s Obama, the rest of whom said they don’t know. I think it’s Romney. I think he’s stealing in “like a thief with good tools,” in Walker Percy’s old words. While everyone is looking at the polls and the storm, Romney’s slipping into the presidency. He’s quietly rising, and he’s been rising for a while. \n \n Obama and the storm, it was like a wave that lifted him and then moved on, leaving him where he’d been. Parts of Jersey and New York are a cold Katrina. The exact dimensions of the disaster will become clearer when the election is over. One word: infrastructure. Officials knew the storm was coming and everyone knew it would be bad, but the people of the tristate area were not aware, until now, just how vulnerable to deep damage their physical system was. The people in charge of that system are the politicians. Mayor Bloomberg wanted to have the Marathon, to show New York’s spirit. In Staten Island last week they were bitterly calling it “the race through the ruins.” There is a disconnect. \n \n But to the election. Who knows what to make of the weighting of the polls and the assumptions as to who will vote? Who knows the depth and breadth of each party’s turnout efforts? Among the wisest words spoken this cycle were by John Dickerson of CBS News and Slate, who said, in a conversation the night before the last presidential debate, that he thought maybe the American people were quietly cooking something up, something we don’t know about. \n \n I think they are and I think it’s this: a Romney win. \n \n Romney’s crowds are building—28,000 in Morrisville, Pa., last night; 30,000 in West Chester, Ohio, Friday It isn’t only a triumph of advance planning: People came, they got through security and waited for hours in the cold. His rallies look like rallies now, not enactments. In some new way he’s caught his stride. He looks happy and grateful. His closing speech has been positive, future-looking, sweetly patriotic. His closing ads are sharp—the one about what’s going on at the rallies is moving. \n \n All the vibrations are right. A person who is helping him who is not a longtime Romneyite told me, yesterday: “I joined because I was anti Obama—I’m a patriot, I’ll join up But now I am pro-Romney.” Why? “I’ve spent time with him and I care about him and admire him. He’s a genuinely good man.” Looking at the crowds on TV, hearing them chant “Three more days” and “Two more days”—it feels like a lot of Republicans have gone from anti-Obama to pro-Romney. \n \n Something old is roaring back. One of the Romney campaign’s surrogates, who appeared at a rally with him the other night, spoke of the intensity and joy of the crowd “I worked the rope line, people wouldn’t let go of my hand.” It startled him. A former political figure who’s been in Ohio told me this morning something is moving with evangelicals, other church-going Protestants and religious Catholics. He said what’s happening with them is quiet, unreported and spreading: They really want Romney now, they’ll go out and vote, the election has taken on a new importance to them. \n \n There is no denying the Republicans have the passion now, the enthusiasm. The Democrats do not. Independents are breaking for Romney. And there’s the thing about the yard signs. In Florida a few weeks ago I saw Romney signs, not Obama ones. From Ohio I hear the same. From tony Northwest Washington, D.C., I hear the same. \n \n Is it possible this whole thing is playing out before our eyes and we’re not really noticing because we’re too busy looking at data on paper instead of what’s in front of us? Maybe that’s the real distortion of the polls this year: They left us discounting the world around us. \n \n And there is Obama, out there seeming tired and wan, showing up through sheer self discipline. A few weeks ago I saw the president and the governor at the Al Smith dinner, and both were beautiful specimens in their white ties and tails, and both worked the dais. But sitting there listening to the jokes and speeches, the archbishop of New York sitting between them, Obama looked like a young challenger—flinty, not so comfortable. He was distracted, and his smiles seemed forced. He looked like a man who’d just seen some bad internal polling. Romney? Expansive, hilarious, self-spoofing, with a few jokes of finely calibrated meanness that were just perfect for the crowd. He looked like a president. He looked like someone who’d just seen good internals. \n \n Of all people, Obama would know…', ""The U.S. and South Korea are to blame for North Korea’s latest missile launch over Japan, and further sanctions on the regime will not ameliorate the situation, Russia said Tuesday. \n \n In defiance of U.N. resolutions banning its missile testing and fresh international sanctions drafted by the U.S., North Korea carried out another missile test on Tuesday morning, the fourth in as many days, this time directly over Japan for the first time. The regime has already traded barbs with President Donald Trump due to its repeated missile testing and expanding range, including a direct threat made at U.S. pacific territory Guam. \n \n That threat prompted the U.S. to rally its allies and, with China and Russia on side, impose new sanctions on the rogue state. \n \n Anticipating more of the same to follow, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told journalists on Tuesday that U.S. actions were pushing the regime toward more tests, not halting it, state news agency Itar-Tass reported. \n \n “If we go by how colleagues from the U.S. and other western countries have acted in the past, then of course we can expect new steps towards tightening the sanctions, but this will not solve the problem,” Ryabkov said. “It is now obvious to everyone that the resources for influencing North Korea with sanctions have run out.” \n \n Ryabkov referred to the joint military exercises the U.S. is currently holding with ally South Korea. The latest Ulchi Freedom Guardian activity involved computer-simulated warfare and took place over the weekend. The drill aims to strengthen the ability to respond to an potential attack from the North and continues until the end of August. The Russian minister called it “a trend of escalation,” a reiteration of China and Russia's previous arguments in favor of limiting U.S. military presence in the Asia Pacific neighborhood. \n \n The North regularly protests U.S. drills in the region, and in his statement Ryabkov appeared to refer to Ulchi Freedom Guardian directly, taking a more sympathetic approach to the North’s tests. \n \n Read More: After U.S. travel ban, North Korea is courting Russian tourists with new agency \n \n “We consider the joint drills that went ahead anyway, albeit in a lighter mode compared to the initial agenda, made an impact in terms of provoking Pyongyang to make the new launch. We are highly concerned by the general developments,” he said. \n \n In principle both Russia and China oppose widespread nuclear proliferation. Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Chinese President Xi Jinping for a trade summit next month, where the pair will discuss North Korea. Public statements of concern aside, though, the two countries maintain a similar approach of suggesting that more U.S. disarmament in the region will help curb the North’s nuclear proliferation goals."", ""By Jon Larson \n \n JACKSON HOLE, Wyo.— Tragedy struck LOTOJA Saturday afternoon as one of the competitors died before reaching the finish line. Details are still somewhat unclear, but roughly 18 miles south of Jackson Hole, Rob Verhaaren tumbled over the side of a bridge and into the Snake River. \n \n Verhaaren fell roughly 30 or 40 feet into the river, and was later pronounced dead at an area hospital. \n \n Verhaaren, who would have turned 43 next week, leaves behind a wife, Bridget, and three young children; Ansel, Helena and Karl. Ansel and Helena also have birthdays next week, Tuesday and Saturday respectively. \n \n Verhaaren received a B.S. degree in accounting from Brigham Young University, magna cum laude, and a J.D. from the New York University School of Law. His most recent position was the Managing Director of Universal Equity Group Funds Arizona. \n \n According to Jay Larson, Verhaaren’s neighbor in Mesa, Ariz., Rob and Bridget were both avid cyclists and loved the sport because it kept them fit and healthy. \n \n “His whole family is awesome,” Larson said. “They would bend over backwards for anyone.” \n \n Just this past Monday, the Verhaaren family was out putting up flags in their neighborhood to celebrate Labor Day. \n \n Verhaaren was a beloved scoutmaster who wanted his scouts to have memorable experiences. One time, without permission, Verhaaren registered his troop into a lottery for a chance to go spend their summer camp on Catalina Island at Camp Emerald Bay. The troop was lucky and thanks to him, more than 30 boys had the opportunity to go to California this past summer. \n \n The Verhaaren family is no stranger to cycling accidents. Bridget crashed earlier this year, breaking her hand and separating her shoulder. \n \n Olympic BMX cyclist, Arielle Martin, wife to Rob’s brother Michael, was also in an accident recently. Her experience at the London Games ended before it truly began as she crashed during a practice run a few days before her event. Since then, Martin has undergone numerous surgeries to repair damage to her liver and one of her lungs. \n \n Dave Collins, one of Verhaaren’s training partners, nearly lost his life in 2009 during a cycling accident of his own. He collided with a car and went through one of the windows, severing his carotid artery. Luckily, an ER doctor was close by and was able to stop the bleeding before it was too late. \n \n Race spokesman Dave Bern says the 206-mile race also was marred by serious accidents in Idaho and Wyoming that sent two bicyclists to the hospital and by flat tires experienced by roughly 200 cyclists early on. \n \n He says it's the first fatality in the race's 30-year history. \n \n LOTOJA, the annual race from Logan, Utah to Jackson Hole, Wyoming is the longest single-day bike race in the country at roughly 206 miles and is sanctioned by USA Cycling.""]",3,"– The official results from Florida aren't in yet but it looks like Nate Silver—whose blog accounted for a fifth of the New York Times' web traffic Monday—correctly called 50 out of 50 states after getting 49 right in 2008.

But while Silver triumphed, there were plenty who got it wrong, notes Politico, which lists more than a dozen pundits who predicted a Romney win with varying degrees of confidence. Among them are assorted Fox pundits, Sarah Palin, and Peggy Noonan at the Wall Street Journal, who wrote ""I think it’s Romney ... While everyone is looking at the polls and the storm, Romney’s slipping into the presidency."" Rush Limbaugh was also way off. ""All of my thinking says Romney big,"" he said Monday.

161,"['For those of you who were offended by a very genuine attempt at fostering a civil discussion, I apologize. \n \n About 10 or 15 minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its 5-4 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which made gay marriage legal across the country, including the 13 states that up until now had banned it, a colleague of mine walked into the PennLive newsroom. \n \n A smile lit up her face and there were tears in her eyes. Up until about 10 a.m. on Friday, my gay colleague sat on pins and needles, waiting to see if nine lawyers were about to throw the life and her and her partner into absolute upheaval. \n \n We embraced and I offered my congratulations. And then I sat down and thought about what had just happened and what it meant to my other gay and lesbian colleagues who were rightfully celebrating Friday\'s ruling as a victory for both love and equal protection under the law. \n \n And as the comments on our main story about the ruling -- many of them openly hostile -- began to pile up, I decided I wanted to send the strongest possible message that the Opinion pages of PennLive and The Patriot-News would be space for civil discussion of one of the most important civil rights rulings of our lifetime. \n \n I came up with three sentences, which currently read like this: \n \n ""As a result of Friday\'s ruling, PennLive/The Patriot-News will very strictly limit op-Eds and letters to the editor in opposition to same-sex marriage. \n \n ""These unions are now the law of the land. And we will not publish such letters and op-Eds any more than we would publish those that are racist, sexist or anti-Semitic. \n \n ""We will, however, for a limited time, accept letters and op-Eds on the high court\'s decision and its legal merits."" \n \n What almost immediately followed was an object lesson in the law of unintended consequences. And, sadly, the strongly worded message included in our editorial was lost. \n \n By day\'s end, I\'d received dozens of emails and several phone calls -- not to mention the hundreds of comments appended to the editorial -- accusing me (and this news organization) of being ""fascists"" opposed to both the First Amendment and the right to freedom of expression. \n \n And those were just the polite ones. \n \n And as I rolled it over in my head yesterday, after hearing from professional colleagues and good friends on the right and left who questioned our policy, I reached a number of conclusions: \n \n First: No one at PennLive and The Patriot-News is an opponent of the First Amendment. It\'s a right that\'s foundational to us as a people. And it\'s a right for which many brave and noble men and women have given their lives. And I would never trample on that legacy or dishonor their sacrifice by limiting our readers\' right to express themselves in a civil way. \n \n Second: And I cannot stress this one enough -- that\'s in a civil way. More than once yesterday I was referred to as ""f****t-lover,"" among other slurs. And that\'s the point that I was trying to make with our statement: We will not publish such slurs any more than we would publish racist, sexist or anti-Semitic speech. There are ways to intelligently discuss an issue. The use of playground insults is not among them. And they are not welcome at PennLive/The Patriot-News. \n \n Third: I fully recognize that there are people of good conscience and of goodwill who will disagree with Friday\'s high court ruling. They include philosophers and men and women of the cloth whose objections come from deeply held religious and moral convictions that are protected by the very same First Amendment that allowed me to stick my foot in my mouth on Friday. They are, and always will be, welcome in these pages, along with all others of goodwill, who seek to have an intelligent and reasoned debate on the issues of the day. \n \n These pages, I remind myself finally, belong to the people of Central Pennsylvania. I\'m a conduit, I recognize, for them to share their views and to have the arguments that make us better as a people. And all views are -- and always will be -- welcome. \n \n My mom -- and probably yours too -- once told me what the road to hell was paved with. Yesterday, I was reminded of the truth of that lesson. \n \n I stand with my gay and lesbian friends who, on Friday, were extended the same protections under the law that the rest of us take for granted. \n \n But for those of you who were offended by what was intended as a very genuine attempt at fostering a civil discussion, I apologize.', 'TOKYO — For the first time since a crisis erupted over deadly defects in airbags made by his family’s company, the reclusive chief executive of the Japanese supplier Takata publicly addressed the issue on Thursday. He offered an apology but defended Takata’s products as fundamentally safe. \n \n “I apologize from my heart to those who have died or been injured,” the chief executive, Shigehisa Takada, said after bowing deeply in a show of remorse. “I feel a heavy responsibility.” \n \n Yet Mr. Takada, the 49-year-old grandson of the company’s founder, did not explain why he had remained all but absent during the crisis that has been at full boil for more than a year. \n \n Even after Toyota and Nissan said on Thursday that they would recall 2.86 million more vehicles equipped with Takata airbags than first announced, Mr. Takada dismissed suggestions that he should resign over what has become the largest automobile safety recall in history. So far, about 35 million vehicles worldwide have been affected. \n \n Takata admitted last month that faults in its airbags could cause their inflaters to explode with too much force when they deploy, endangering the drivers and passengers that the safety devices are intended to protect. At least eight deaths and 130 injuries have been linked to the defect. \n \n Mr. Takada made his remarks at a news conference after Takata’s annual shareholder meeting. He had briefly addressed the airbag issue at the last meeting a year ago, where he apologized to the company’s investors. But until Thursday, he had not spoken directly to the public or taken questions from the news media. \n \n Mr. Takada shed little new light on the nature of the defects, and he acknowledged that Takata was making slow progress with its investigation. The company said it had identified manufacturing failures, which it says have since been resolved, as being responsible for faults in about 10 million airbag inflaters. \n \n Defects traced to the manufacturing problems, mainly careless handling of inflater components at two North American factories, were called “alpha cases” inside the company, Takata executives said on Thursday. \n \n Questions still surround what the company calls “beta cases,” involving inflaters that were not subject to any known mishandling during production but that ruptured anyway. Prolonged exposure to heat and humidity is suspected to be a contributing factor to the failures, but Takata said it was still trying to pinpoint the exact cause or causes. \n \n Mr. Takada and other executives rejected the theory, put forward by some experts, that the basic design of Takata’s inflaters was dangerous because the company uses an explosive propellant, ammonium nitrate, that other airbag manufacturers have avoided because it is deemed potentially unstable. \n \n Continue reading the main story Danger in the Steering Wheel Airbags made by the Takata Corporation have a potential defect when they deploy. Some have ruptured, sending metal fragments into the car. At least eight deaths and more than 100 injuries have been linked to the problem. INFLATER/CANISTER PROPELLANT Cutaway view INFLATER/CANISTER STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG HOW IT WORKS: Inside the canister, pellets of a propellant based on ammonium nitrate, a common compound used in fertilizer, are ignited and generate the nitrogen gas that inflates the airbag in a fraction of a second. THE PROBLEM: Takata has said manufacturing problems, together with exposure to moisture in cars in humid regions, can cause the propellant to degrade. This can make the propellant burn too strongly when the airbag is deployed, rupturing the inflater and sending metal fragments into the car’s interior and injuring the driver or passengers. \n \n “We have been working with ammonium nitrate for more than 10 years, and have tested it in a variety of ways,” Mr. Takada said. “As far as I’m concerned, it is safe and reliable.” \n \n Some of Takata’s replacement inflaters also use ammonium nitrate, meaning that if the chemical turns out to be part of the problem, devices in cars that have been recalled and repaired may ultimately fail as well. Takata met with harsh criticism from American lawmakers at a congressional hearing this week, as well as with questions about the replacement airbags. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n One automaker, Fiat Chrysler, told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that it would no longer use Takata inflaters in replacement of driver’s side airbags in its cars, citing Takata’s use of ammonium nitrate. \n \n In a technical presentation on Thursday, Hiroshi Shimizu, a senior vice president at Takata, said it was likely that a combination of factors was behind the “beta cases.” \n \n “There is no evidence that the gas destabilizes on its own,” he said. \n \n The Takada family took the airbag manufacturer public nearly a decade ago, but it still controls a majority of shares, mostly through a family-owned holding company. And the family has tightened its grip over the course of the airbag crisis. \n \n Photo \n \n In December, the Takata board voted to replace Stefan Stocker, the Swiss citizen who became president in 2013, and handed responsibility for day-to-day operations to Mr. Takada, who was then in a more symbolic role as chairman. Mr. Takada is now both chairman and president. \n \n The move has had little obvious effect on Takata’s response to the crisis, which has been criticized as slow and poorly communicated. \n \n Takata had planned to allow journalists to observe the shareholder meeting on Thursday, but it denied access at the last moment. \n \n Takata’s share price has fallen about 40 percent since the shareholder meeting a year ago. The company suspended dividend payments after it reported a net loss of 29.5 billion yen, or $238 million, for the fiscal year that ended in March. \n \n The company’s official forecast is for a return to profit this year, but with lawsuits in North America and no clear end to the recalls in sight, analysts say the outlook is most likely too optimistic. \n \n Asked on Thursday if he would resign to take responsibility for the crisis, Mr. Takada said he would not. \n \n “My first responsibility is to ensure customers’ safety by making sure the company responds firmly to the problem,” he said.', ""Oh, I’m not going to kill you. I’m just going to...sue you? Wait, that’s not how the line goes. Well, that is, unless you’re Reddit user BlackPanther2016.

Actor Jared Leto even told Telestar, “There are a lot of scenes that didn’t make it to the final film. Hopefully they will see the light of day. Who knows.” But, for one Reddit user, the studio’s choice is totally unacceptable. “I wasted alot of money paying and travelling to go watch this movie because of these specific scenes they had advertised to me and all of us saying, “hey, check out our preview! this will all be in our movie, come watch it on the 5th!!”. All lies,” he explained before continuing. “I'm now taking this to court. I want my refund, the trauma of being embarrassed as I was being kicked out and people laughing at me for wanting my refund, and also the 160 pounds of fuel money I used to drive to London from Scotland.” \n \n If you happen to feel the same way as BlackPanther2016, then you now have a champion for this cause. The user’s post finishes with them calling out to similarly disappointed fans, urging others to stand up against Hollywood’s “unjust” advertising schemes. “Let's stop this nonsense of false bullsh**ery...and don't let them bribe you with their “deluxe premium special directors gold extended edition supreme cut” nonsense,” the user pleads. “You should get what they advertised as their first theatre showing and what you have paid for based on what they have showed you in their advertisements.”"", 'WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — A bag carried to the moon aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft and used for the first sample of lunar material is at the center a legal fight after the government mistakenly sold it during the criminal case against the former director of the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center. \n \n The white bag — which was flown to the moon on Apollo 11 in June 1969 and has lunar material embedded in its fabric — is ""a rare artifact, if not a national treasure,"" the government said. \n \n The dispute is the latest legal twist in the case of Max Ary, the founder and longtime director of the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson who was convicted in November 2005 for stealing and selling museum artifacts. \n \n At issue in his prosecution were hundreds of missing space artifacts and memorabilia. Some were on loan from NASA to the Cosmosphere. The lunar bag was discovered in 2003 during the execution of a search warrant in a box located in Ary\'s garage. \n \n On Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office asked a federal judge to set aside the final forfeiture order and rescind the bag\'s sale, saying that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was not properly notified of its forfeiture because the bag was misidentified. \n \n The bag was sold at a government auction on Feb. 15, 2015 for $995 to Nancy Carlson in Inverness, Illinois. NASA learned the Apollo 11 bag had been sold without notice or permission when Carlson sent it to NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston for authentication. Carlson separately sued NASA in June in a federal court in Illinois, seeking the return of the bag. \n \n Federal prosecutors want the federal judge in Kansas who handled Ary\'s criminal case and subsequent forfeiture to rescind the sale and refund Carlson her money. \n \n Apparently, two lunar bags were confused as one and the same after inventory identification numbers of them were combined on spreadsheets, the government said. \n \n The other bag was an Apollo 17 lunar sample bag that was flown to the lunar surface aboard the Lunar Module Challenger. That bag was sold by Ary at a 2001 auction for $24,150, and it was later recovered by the government during its investigation. \n \n Ary, who was president and CEO of the Cosmosphere from 1976 to 2002, was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $132,274 in restitution. He has since been released from prison after serving about 70 percent of his sentence. \n \n He has always maintained his innocence, saying he accidentally mixed museum artifacts with ones he collected and sold privately from his home.']",4,"– The biggest apology of the week came from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, but it was hardly the only one to make headlines: Shamed: “I apologize from my heart to those who have died or been injured.

162,"['The medical report said Mr McKinnon, who is known to suffer Asperger’s syndrome, a form of autism, also has a “fixed-psychological conviction he will kill himself in preference to being extradited”. \n \n The emergency study by consultant psychiatrist Professor Jeremy Turk of St George\'s Hospital, London, said that suicide was now an “almost certain inevitability”. \n \n Details of the report emerged following a decision by Alan Johnson, the Home Secretary, not to block the extradition on medical grounds, as disclosed by The Daily Telegraph on Thursday. \n \n Mr McKinnon’s distraught mother said the Government, and Mr Johnson, ""should hang their heads in shame"" over the extradition to face hacking charges. \n \n Extracts of Prof Turk\'s report, disclosed in the Daily Mail, show that he recorded in September that Mr McKinnon, 43, suffered from a ""\'very serious Major Depressive Disorder.... aggravated and complicated by anxiety and panic attacks with multiple psychosomatic symptoms on a background of his having Asperger\'s syndrome"". \n \n But following the failure of Mr McKinnon\'s bid to have his case heard at the Supreme Court, he concluded that he was now ""at an even higher risk of self harm and suicide"", something he said was a ""real probability"". \n \n Mr Johnson, who was shown the report, said that he felt the information he had seen was “not materially different from that placed before the High Court earlier this year” when Mr McKinnon lost his earlier legal challenge. \n \n He added: “It is clear from the proceedings to date that Mr McKinnon will not, if convicted, serve any of his sentence in a supermax prison. \n \n ""Should Mr McKinnon be extradited, charged and convicted in the US and seek repatriation to the UK to serve a custodial sentence, the Government will of course progress his application at the very earliest opportunity.” \n \n The family, who were informed of Mr Johnson\'s decision on Thursday, are now set to apply for a judicial review in a bid to stop his extradition. \n \n The decision was almost universally criticised by opposition MPs, campaigners. \n \n Mrs Sharp said: ""To force a peaceful, vulnerable, misguided UFO fanatic like Gary thousands of miles away from his much-needed support network is barbaric. \n \n ""This is a cruel and miserable decision. \n \n ""If the severity of Gary\'s medical condition isn\'t sufficient to prevent his extradition, I can\'t imagine what is. God help others facing a similar fate. I\'m so upset and angry."" \n \n She added: ""Where are the \'very real safeguards\' that the Government consistently hid behind when forcing this appalling Act through Parliament. \n \n ""The only people who won\'t get extradited are terrorists facing the death sentence, the very people the Act was meant to be about. \n \n ""What bitter irony."" \n \n Mrs Sharp said her legal team would now apply for a judicial review, but if that was not granted then her son could be extradited before Christmas. \n \n ""What a heartless and cowardly decision this is,"" she said. \n \n Mrs Sharp wept as she told how she broke the news to Mr McKinnon. \n \n She said: “He was very, very bad. He was very quiet – and I am more worried when he is quiet. I have got concerns for Gary. Alan Johnson has made the wrong decision. It is just awful.” \n \n Mr McKinnon\'s lawyer, Karen Todner, said: ""It\'s a devastating blow but we are not going to give up. \n \n ""We are certainly coming to the end of the road. \n \n ""We\'re just hoping at some point someone sees sense and steps in. \n \n ""All the legal team do know is we cannot give up because in some ways it\'s like dealing with a Death Row case, and we genuinely believe that Gary\'s life is at stake here."" \n \n Another of his legal team said: “It is a miserable decision that we fundamentally disagree with – he could be gone by Christmas. We are considering all our legal avenues. What does it take for someone not to be extradited?” \n \n She added that she planned to issue judicial review proceedings next week, but added: ""We are normally allowed three months to issue but the Home Secretary has only allowed us seven days."" \n \n Keith Vaz MP, the chairman of the home affairs select committee which has pressed Mr Johnson directly not to extradite Mr McKinnon, said: “I am very disappointed at this decision. This is the wrong decision for the wrong reasons."" \n \n Last month Mr Johnson threw a lifeline to Mr McKinnon, who suffers from a form of autism, with a promise to examine new medical evidence “very carefully” before deciding on his extradition last month. \n \n However in an emailed letter to Mrs Sharp, Mr Johnson is understood to have said that a decision to block the extradition of Mr McKinnon was not in his control. \n \n During an earlier legal battle in the summer, judges warned Mr McKinnon, who is accused of hacking into networks at the Pentagon and Nasa from his flat in north London, might kill himself if he was extradited. \n \n The legal process, which had been paused while Mr Johnson considered the medical evidence, will now start again, with legal sources suggesting Mr McKinnon could be extradited by Christmas. \n \n Mr McKinnon’s lawyers can either seek a fresh emergency judicial review of Mr Johnson’s decision at the High Court within the next seven days or appeal to the European Court of Human Rights within the next 14 days. \n \n David Burrowes, the Conservatives’ shadow justice minister and Mr McKinnon’s local MP, said: “It is extremely disappointing that the repeated calls for compassion and justice for Gary have been ignored by the Home Secretary. \n \n ""Despite substantial medical grounds giving Alan Johnson the opportunity to stop the extradition, he has washed his hands of Gary. \n \n ""The decision flies in the face of the medical evidence, which showed the serious risks to his health and life if extradition was to be granted.” \n \n Mr Vaz added: ""The unanimous view of the Home Affairs Select Committee was that the Home Secretary has the power to intervene. \n \n ""His [Alan Johnson\'s] decision has important constitutional implications if he is not prepared to use his discretion even though he is allowed to so no matter how narrow the scope.” \n \n Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society which has been campaigning on behalf of Mr McKinnon, said: ""We are bitterly disappointed by the Home Secretary’s decision and feel hugely sympathetic towards Gary and his family who have now been living under extreme stress for a prolonged period of time. \n \n ""People with Asperger syndrome are often much more vulnerable than appearances would suggest and can be highly susceptible to additional mental health problems. \n \n ""On the strength of recently submitted medical evidence and the support of the Home Affairs committee, we had hoped that Mr Johnson would listen to these concerns. \n \n ""The National Autistic Society will continue to support Gary and his family during this incredibly difficult time and as the case continues.” \n \n Mr McKinnon, 43, from Wood Green, North London, has insisted that his hacking of Pentagon computers was nothing more than him searching for reports of UFO sightings. \n \n He is being extradited under a treaty which has been criticised because, while British prosecutors must provide details of the evidence against an American citizen, US prosecutors need only explain the charges to take a Briton to America. \n \n Mr Johnson said: ""I have carefully considered the representations in the case of Gary McKinnon. \n \n ""I am clear that the information is not materially different from that placed before the High Court earlier this year and does not demonstrate that sending Mr McKinnon to the United States would breach his human rights. \n \n ""As the courts have affirmed, I have no general discretion. If Mr McKinnon\'s human rights would be breached, I must stop the extradition. If they would not be breached, the extradition must go ahead."" \n \n He added: ""Earlier this year the High Court upheld the extradition request for Mr McKinnon. This was after all proceedings under the Extradition Act 2003 had been completed. \n \n ""The High Court dismissed a further challenge by Mr McKinnon that extradition to the USA would be in breach of his human rights. \n \n ""Throughout this process there have been a number of assurances. Firstly due to legitimate concerns over Mr McKinnon\'s health, we have sought and received assurances from the United States authorities that his needs will be met. These were before the High Court in July. \n \n ""It is also clear from the proceedings to date that Mr McKinnon will not, if convicted, serve any of his sentence in a supermax prison. Finally, should Mr McKinnon be extradited, charged and convicted in the US and seek repatriation to the UK to serve a custodial sentence, the Government will of course progress his application at the very earliest opportunity. \n \n ""I know there is a concern on all sides to see a conclusion to these proceedings. It is now open to Mr McKinnon\'s lawyer to consider their legal options. As a consequence I do not propose to comment any further.""', 'Gary McKinnon and his family were told yesterday that Alan Johnson is to allow the extradition to go ahead after refusing to block it on medical grounds. \n \n Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger\'s syndrome, is accused by the US authorities of breaking into military and Nasa computers. He has admitted hacking but maintains he was looking only for evidence of UFOs. \n \n He was told in a letter from the Home Secretary that the extradition would now ""proceed forthwith"" after finding that there was ""nothing incompatible"" between extradition and Mr McKinnon\'s human rights. \n \n The family said last night that Mr McKinnon, who could be sentenced to up to 60 years in prison in the US, was ""at risk of suicide"" after being told there will be no 11th hour reprieve. His mother, Janis Sharp, was ""extremely worried"" about her son\'s mental state and said the Government and Mr Johnson should ""hang their heads in shame"" for caving in to American pressure. \n \n She said: ""This is a cruel and miserable decision. To force a peaceful, vulnerable, misguided UFO fanatic like Gary thousands of miles away from his much-needed support network is barbaric. If the severity of Gary\'s medical condition isn\'t sufficient to prevent his extradition, I can\'t imagine what is."" \n \n She added: ""This government is terrified of speaking up to America, and now they are allowing vulnerable people to be pursued for non-violent crime when they should be going after terrorists. Why are they doing this?"" \n \n Karen Todner, the hacker\'s solicitor, said there was still hope. ""It\'s a devastating blow but we are not going to give up. We are going to issue judicial review proceedings. We normally have three months to do this but have now been given seven days to issue."" \n \n In July Mr McKinnon went to the High Court in an attempt to get the extradition order overturned but was told being sent for trial in the US was ""a lawful and proportionate response"" to his actions. A month ago he was refused permission to take his case to the Supreme Court when judges decided he had ""no real prospect"" of success. \n \n The case has highlighted concerns about the Extradition Act 2003 which critics maintain erodes the rights of individuals in Britain without a similar concession being given in the US. They argue that Britons can be extradited without any assessment of the evidence against them and on cases so weak that they would never reach court at home. \n \n The US authorities only have to produce an arrest warrant to show that the person is wanted. In contrast, if British prosecutors want to extradite someone from the US they have to demonstrate likely guilt. \n \n The Home Secretary has been given assurances by the US authorities that Mr McKinnon\'s medical needs will be met. Mr Johnson said he had considered carefully the case but rejected it. ""I am clear that the information is not materially different from that placed before the High Court earlier this year and does not demonstrate that sending Mr McKinnon to the United States would breach his human rights,"" he said. \n \n ""It is also clear from the proceedings to date that Mr McKinnon will not, if convicted, serve any of his sentence in a supermax prison. Finally, should Mr McKinnon be extradited, charged and convicted in the US and seek repatriation to the UK to serve a custodial sentence, the Government will of course progress his application at the very earliest opportunity."" \n \n Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, described the extradition treaty as unfair and Mr Johnson\'s decision as ""shameful"". \n \n Mr McKinnon is said by the US authorities to have been responsible for ""the biggest military hack of all time"". He is said to have caused $700,000 worth of damage and forced the US Army\'s entire network to be shut down for 24 hours.']",2,"– A British man who hacked his way into Pentagon computers looking for information on UFOs has lost his final appeal against extradition. Gary McKinnon, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, is now expected to be sent to the US for trial within weeks, the Independent reports. The 43-year-old Londoner could face up to 60 years in jail if found guilty of what US authorities call the biggest military hack in history. Opposition lawmakers and McKinnon's supporters slammed the decision to reject the appeal, citing medical reports that said deportation was likely to make him suicidal. ""To force a peaceful, vulnerable, misguided UFO fanatic like Gary thousands of miles away from his much-needed support network is barbaric,"" his mother told the Telegraph.

The officer on the bridge was using binoculars to keep lookout, but at that moment was looking off the starboard side, Melvaer said. Had his wife not asked him to step outside, he would have missed it, too. \n \n “We were basically just crossing exactly where it was at the time,” Melvaer said. “It’s just a stroke of luck. There was no skill involved. It just took a pair of eyes looking in that direction at that particular time.” \n \n Melvaer said he’s tried to wrap his head around how unlikely it was. \n \n “You kind of think a little bit and try to understand the concept of how big it really is,” he said. “It’s amazing. We kind of felt like it wanted to be found.” \n \n The discovery, nearly eight months after Austin and Perry left the Jupiter Inlet and never returned, has been called a “miracle” by the U.S. Coast Guard. Coast Guardsmen initially found it floating 67 miles off the coast of Daytona Beach two days after the Tequesta teens disappeared. They attached a data marker buoy to it and continued searching for the boys, but the device failed. When they went to retrieve the boat, it was gone. \n \n The boat is now packed in a shipping container and expected to arrive May 16 at Port Everglades. Its contents — Austin’s iPhone, two fishing rods and two small tackle boxes — have been returned to the families. The phone could offer clues to their disappearance if the family wants to pursue them. \n \n Melvaer said Sunday that after spotting the boat, the crew hoisted it on board to remove it from the shipping lane, a standard practice. The boat was intact and had a serial number on the engine, so he notified the Coast Guard. \n \n In the meantime, he wondered about the boat and its crew. \n \n “I went up to my office and basically Googled ‘missing fisherman,’ I think, and it (Austin and Perry’s story) came up as one of the first ones,” he said. \n \n He had never heard of the boys, but when the Coast Guard confirmed his suspicion and asked him to send photos, Melvaer was stunned. He and the crew felt they had to protect what was now precious cargo, he said, and they made sure it was kept out of harm’s way while on board. \n \n “I’m a parent myself, so I can identify with the situation,” he said. “I’ve been boating since I was a kid as well. \n \n “That goes for all the crew, as well. They had the same reaction. They felt that it was important to get this properly done and try not to do extra damage.” \n \n Since he started training at age 17, he’s only twice run across abandoned vessels in the water — one time the bow of a boat off the coast of India, and a second time a downed helicopter he happened to be searching for. \n \n “It’s not something that happens every day,” he said. “When you’re at sea, things have a tendency to blend in.” \n \n Melvaer declined to discuss particular details about the boat or its contents, citing the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission investigation and concern for the boys’ families. He wouldn’t say whether Austin’s cellphone was in usable condition. \n \n His hope is that the chance discovery might bring some peace to the families. \n \n “Let’s hope that this leads to something good,” he said. “Of course, nothing can ever replace what’s lost.

165,"['BOSTON—Twenty-five years after the notorious burglary of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, law enforcement officials are seeking the public’s assistance in identifying an unauthorized visitor to the museum the night before the theft. That person entered the museum through the same door as the thieves in the middle of the night, 24 hours before the theft. \n \n “Over many months we have engaged in an exhaustive re-examination of the original evidence in this case. Our aim has been to ensure that all avenues have been explored in the continuing quest to recover these artworks,” said United States Attorney Carmen Ortiz. “Today we are releasing video images from the night before the theft—images which have not previously been seen by the public—with the hope of identifying an unauthorized visitor to the museum. With the public’s help, we may be able to develop new information that could lead to the recovery of these invaluable works of art.” \n \n The video footage released today, captured by Museum security cameras 24 hours before the Gardner heist, shows an automobile pull up next to a rear entrance of the Museum. The car matches the general description of a vehicle that was reported to have been parked outside the Museum moments prior to the theft on March 18, 1990. \n \n The video also shows an unidentified man exiting the automobile and then being allowed inside the Museum, against Museum policy, by a security guard. That event occurred at 12:49 p.m. on March 17, 1990, almost exactly 24 hours before the thieves entered the museum through the same door. \n \n While the images of both the vehicle and the unidentified man are low resolution, law enforcement officials hope that releasing the footage will assist with identifying the man or the vehicle in the video. \n \n Anyone with information regarding the video should call the FBI at 617-742-5533 or the Isabella Gardner Museum at 617-278-5114. \n \n Vincent Lisi, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Boston said, “This latest request for the public’s assistance illustrates the FBI’s continued commitment to the Gardner investigation. By releasing this video, we hope to generate meaningful leads and ultimately recover the stolen artwork.” \n \n A $5 million reward has been offered by the Museum for information that leads directly to the recovery of all of the stolen items in good condition. The recovery of an individual object will result in a portion of the reward, based upon the object’s market value relative to the other stolen objects. \n \n “We remain committed to one goal: the return of all 13 works to their rightful place, which is here at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. To that end, we support the efforts that the United States Attorney and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are making to uncover any and all information related to the theft of our artwork. We believe that no stone should be left unturned,” said Anthony Amore, Director of Security at the Gardner Museum. \n \n In the early morning hours of March 18, 1990, two white males dressed in Boston Police uniforms gained entrance to the Gardner Museum by advising the security guard at the watch desk that they were responding to a report of a disturbance within the compound. Against Museum policy, the guard allowed the thieves into the facility. Upon entry the two thieves subdued the on-duty security personnel, handcuffed them, and secured both guards in separate remote areas of the Museum’s basement. The suspects did not brandish weapons, nor were any weapons seen during the heist. No panic button was activated and no Boston Police notification was made during the robbery. The video surveillance film from the evening of the robbery was seized by the thieves prior to departure. They did not take the video footage from the night before. \n \n The combined value of the 13 works of art stolen during the Gardner theft is at least $500 million, though they are considered priceless within the art community. The following objects were stolen during the burglary and have been missing for the past 25 years: \n \n 1) Vermeer’s ""The Concert"" \n \n 2) Rembrandt’s ""A Lady and Gentleman in Black"" \n \n 3) Rembrandt’s ""The Storm on the Sea of Galilee"" \n \n 4) Rembrandt’s ""Self Portrait"" \n \n 5) Govaert Flinck’s ""Landscape with an Obelisk"" \n \n 6) A Shang Dynasty Chinese Bronze Beaker from 1200-1100 BC \n \n 7) Degas\' ""La Sortie du Pelage"" \n \n 8) Degas\' ""Cortege Aux Environs de Florence"" \n \n 9) Degas\' ""Three Mounted Jockeys"" \n \n 10) Degas\' ""Program for an Artistic Soiree"" (charcoal on white paper) \n \n 11) Degas\' ""Program for an Artistic Soiree"" (less finished charcoal on buff paper) \n \n 12) Manet’s ""Chez Tortoni"" \n \n 13) Napoleonic Eagle Finial \n \n - More information on Gardner Museum theft', 'Uploaded on Aug 6, 2015 \n \n Twenty-five years after the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum burglary, law enforcement officials are seeking the public’s assistance in identifying an unauthorized visitor who entered the museum through the same door as the thieves 24 hours before the heist.', 'BOSTON (AP) — Twenty-five years after the famed art heist at Boston\'s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, law enforcement officials released new surveillance video Thursday showing an unauthorized visitor entering the museum the night before the robbery. \n \n FILE - In this March 11, 2010 file photo, the empty frame, center, from which thieves cut Rembrandt\'s ""Storm on the Sea of Galilee"" remains on display at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston....

Authorities did not say Abath was the guard in the video, but three officials familiar with the investigation confirmed to the Globe that it is he. \n \n Officials released the video to solicit the public’s help in identifying the second man, hoping to make some movement in the largest unsolved art theft in the world. \n \n It was not immediately clear why the surveillance footage of the night before the robbery had not been made public before, and whether it was viewed by the FBI in the initial investigation. The robbers had seized surveillance footage from the night of the heist, though they did not take footage from the previous night. \n \n Several law enforcement officials said the video appears to have been overlooked and mixed in with other evidence at the onset of the case. US Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz said that a team of investigators began reviewing the original evidence, and that one of them, Assistant US Attorney Robert Fisher, requested the video, which was in the custody of the FBI. Officials then decided to release it to the public in hopes it could lead to new information. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “We have this big question mark as to who this individual is,” Ortiz said. “The hope is that someone will recognize the unauthorized visitor . . . and provide some fruitful leads that will help us figure out where the paintings are, lead to some information, to some people we haven’t thought of before.” \n \n Abath, who is now in his late 40s and lives in Vermont, has denied any ties to the robbery plot, though he admitted to violating museum protocol at the time of the robbery by opening the door to the two men dressed as police officers claiming to be responding to a disturbance. Protocol required him to seek a supervisor’s approval before letting anyone into the museum after hours. \n \n A Globe reporter who went to Abath’s house Thursday morning in Brattleboro was turned away by a woman who said he did not live there. Abath has admitted to bringing friends to the museum at least once several months before the robbery, but he never disclosed that he let someone in the night before the heist. He has said he opened the door only for security checks. \n \n “What you see in the video does not comport with what we have been told in the past,” said Anthony Amore, the museum’s director of security, who has worked with the FBI and the US attorney’s office in a renewed push in recent years to solve the heist. \n \n He said the video “is compelling in that perhaps the identity of this person . . . will shed new light on exactly what happened March 18 [1990], who else may be involved, and hopefully lead us to our paintings.” \n \n Globe reporters discuss new video in Gardner museum heist \n \n No one can be charged with the theft of the paintings because the statute of limitations has expired, but authorities could still seek charges against someone in possession of the stolen works. Ortiz has said she would consider granting immunity to anyone who may possess the paintings in exchange for their return. The museum has offered a $5 million reward for the return of the works. \n \n Abath, who has recently worked as a teacher’s aide in Vermont, has long been under suspicion, in part because of his admission to violating museum protocol and because of the way the robbery was carried out. \n \n Once Abath buzzed the men into the museum’s side entrance on Palace Road at 1:24 a.m. on March 18, 1990, the men subdued him, then waited for the second guard on duty and tied him up as well. They then spent 81 minutes in the museum, making off with 13 works of art, including three Rembrandts, a Vermeer, and a Manet. \n \n Investigators have questioned why Abath’s footsteps were the only ones picked up by motion detectors in the first-floor gallery, where one of the stolen paintings was taken, just before the two robbers scoured the rest of the museum. \n \n One of Abath’s most questionable disclosures was that he opened and closed the Palace Road door 20 minutes before the robbery, which prompted investigators to ask whether he was signaling the robbers. The action was also in violation of security protocol, though Abath maintained he routinely opened the door during his rounds. \n \n He did open the door on March 17. The footage starts just before 1 a.m., and it shows a car moving in reverse on Palace Road, a one-way street, after the second guard on duty went on his rounds. An unidentified man approaches the museum from the direction of the car, and Abath seems to grant him access through the first door by hitting an intercom button. \n \n The man does not enter the museum’s second door, but returns to the car and turns on its parking lights. \n \n The footage then shows the man returning to the museum. Abath again buzzes the man in, but this time the man remains in the museum reception area for more than three minutes before returning to the car and leaving. \n \n The footage also shows that the unidentified man parked the car at roughly the same spot where several young people who had emerged from a St. Patrick’s Day party the morning of the robbery reported seeing a red hatchback. One of the partygoers reported seeing two men dressed as police officers inside, roughly an hour before the robbery occurred. \n \n The color, make, and model of the car in the new surveillance video could not be determined, though authorities said Thursday that it matches the general description of the vehicle seen the night of the robbery. \n \n Lyle Grindle, who headed security for the museum at the time of the theft, said in an interview Thursday that he had been shown the security tape by federal investigators about a month ago, but that he was unable to identify the visitor who had been allowed into the museum. He said he told investigators that allowing such a visit was a violation of the museum’s strict security procedures, which prohibited any late-night entries, even by police or firefighters. \n \n Grindle said it appeared to him that the tape had been recently unearthed by the federal officials, but he did not ask why it had not been viewed before by investigators. \n \n “I believe all the prior tapes from the previous nights were taken by the FBI, and I never saw them again,” said Grindle, who stayed on as security director for years after the heist and oversaw an upgrade of the museum’s security system. \n \n Grindle said he did not know if Abath had been questioned by the federal officials who interviewed him. \n \n “Someone has to explain why the security protocol was broken two nights in a row now, and I think only Rick can answer that question now,” Grindle said. \n \n It was not immediately clear if Abath has recently discussed his actions that night with authorities. \n \n No one has ever been charged in connection with the theft of the paintings, and none of the works have been recovered, making it Boston’s last great mystery following the capture and conviction of notorious gangster and longtime fugitive James “Whitey” Bulger. The artworks are considered priceless on the black market. \n \n In 2013 the FBI publicly disclosed for the first time that agents believe they know who took the art, and that the works had made their way through underground organized crime channels from Boston through Connecticut to Philadelphia, where they were last believed to be seen. \n \n Amore called the new video troubling, but added, “It doesn’t knock us off course on the stuff we’ve been talking about.” He said the video “raises more questions than answers.”']",4,"– The FBI hopes new surveillance footage released today will aid in the recovery of 13 priceless artworks stolen 25 years ago and help put to rest one of Boston's greatest mysteries. In the early hours of March 18, 1990, two men dressed as cops were let into the Gardner Museum, where they tied up two security guards and absconded with the artwork and the museum's security footage, the Boston Globe reports. But the thieves, who have never been identified, may have missed one key thing. According to the FBI, surveillance footage from the day before the robbery shows a security guard letting a man into the museum—against protocol—through the same door later used in the robbery. The Globe reports it's unclear why this footage wasn't viewed by law enforcement earlier, but it could show a ""dry run"" of the heist. The newspaper identifies Richard Abath as the security guard in the footage, and the FBI is hoping the public can help identify the mystery man he lets in. Abath, a rock musician at the time who now lives in Vermont, has claimed he had no part in the robbery, but this new footage appears to contradict a number of his statements. No one has ever been charged with stealing the art—for which there is a $5 million reward—and no one ever will, as the statute of limitations has expired. Someone in possession of the paintings, however, could face charges. Their total value exceeds $500 million, reports AP."
166,"['The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bans companies from paying foreign officials to get more business. The law has recently been targeted by lobbyists — including an arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with ties to Wal-Mart — who criticize it as too broad and bad for business. \n \n The Times investigation found that Wal-Mart de Mexico paid more than $24 million in bribes to win construction permits. When a whistleblower alerted top Wal-Mart executives in 2005, they launched an investigation that found evidence of the bribery but then shut down the inquiry. The company failed to report any of the information to law enforcement at the time, the Times story said. \n \n The revelations threaten to blemish the cleaned-up image Wal-Mart has carefully put together in recent years after facing criticism that it paid workers too little and put mom-and-pop stores out of business. \n \n As officials in recent years have stepped up their enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Chamber has been pushing for the law to be scaled back. \n \n The U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, an arm of the Chamber that has been a leader in criticizing the law, listed two Wal-Mart executives as board members in its 2010 tax form: Jeff Gearhart, Wal-Mart’s general counsel, and Thomas Hyde, a former Wal-Mart corporate secretary who stepped down in August 2010. \n \n Hyde was among the company executives who received initial reports of the alleged bribery in 2005, according to the Times story. \n \n “We take compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) very seriously and are committed to having a strong and effective global anti-corruption program in every country in which we operate,” David Tovar, Wal-Mart’s vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement Saturday. “Many of the alleged activities in The New York Times article are more than six years old. If these allegations are true, it is not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for.” \n \n A spokesman for Justice Department declined to comment. The people who confirmed the department’s investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity because the probe is ongoing. \n \n Wal-Mart’s shares slid nearly 5 percent Monday, and the company faced more questions about how much it knew about the corruption and why it did not tell authorities. Reps. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Wal-Mart chief executive Michael Duke requesting an in-person meeting about the bribery allegations. \n \n Labor critics again raised alarms about the company’s practices. \n \n “The reported cover-up by Walmart executives at the highest levels exposes a core truth: Walmart cannot be taken at its word,” Joe Hansen, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said in statement. \n \n One in five Wal-Mart stores is in Mexico. Wal-Mart de Mexico is the company’s largest foreign subsidiary. \n \n Staff writer Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.', 'Stock Chart for Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV (WALMEXV) \n \n Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is the subject of a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation into allegations of bribery in its Mexican subsidiary, according to a person familiar with the probe. \n \n The Justice Department is investigating potential criminal charges under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to the person familiar with the probe who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about it. Wal-Mart is conducting its own review of allegations that its representatives paid local officials in Mexico to get stores opened faster in the early 2000s. \n \n The investigations by the government and the company may prompt executive departures and U.S. penalties if it reveals senior managers didn’t take strong enough action, governance specialists said. The probes also may slow Wal-Mart’s expansion in Mexico and other markets. \n \n “The penalties paid by companies in settling these types of FCPA investigations have grown significantly larger in recent years,” said Jeffrey Lehtman, a Washington-based partner with the law firm of Richards Kibbe & Orbe LLP. “Depending on the facts uncovered, companies like Wal-Mart can expect the penalties to be incredibly high.” \n \n The bribery allegations were described in an April 21 New York Times story. In a December 2011 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wal-Mart said it was examining whether it was in compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, without saying what region or time period was in question. \n \n “It is an open question as to whether Wal-Mart’s prior disclosure would have allowed investors to understand the magnitude of potential exposure,” said Lehtman, whose firm handles Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases. \n \n ‘Anti-Corruption Program’ \n \n Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment. John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment earlier yesterday on whether the agency plans to investigate the Wal-Mart allegations. \n \n The company said in an April 21 statement that it has met voluntarily with the Justice Department and the SEC to discuss the case. The company is also enhancing its audit procedures and internal controls to escalate to management possible violations of the bribery law. \n \n Jeff Gearhart, the company’s general counsel and corporate secretary, told employees in an April 21 memo that the alleged violations “occurred more than six years ago” and are “not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for.” \n \n In a separate note sent to employees yesterday, Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke said Wal-Mart is conducting an “aggressive investigation” and “will not tolerate violations anywhere or at any level of the company.” David Tovar, a company spokesman, confirmed the authenticity of both documents. \n \n Mexican Expansion \n \n The expansion of Wal-Mart de Mexico, mainly in the last decade, left the world’s largest retailer with about 20 percent of its stores in Mexico, out of more than 10,000 worldwide. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart’s sales rose about 6 percent last year to $447 billion. Wal-Mart has more than doubled the number of stores in Mexico to 2,088 since 2008. \n \n The investigation may slow Wal-Mart’s growth in the country if authorities there feel pressure to show more scrutiny of its permits, Robert Carroll, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, said yesterday in a report. \n \n Wal-Mart de Mexico, which is 69 percent owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell 12 percent yesterday to 37.89 pesos in Mexico City, the biggest decline since May 4, 1998. The parent company’s shares slid 4.7 percent to $59.54 at the close in New York, the biggest drop since Aug. 10. \n \n Conference Call \n \n Walmex’s first-quarter net income rose 4.5 percent to 4.71 billion pesos ($357 million) from 4.5 billion a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Sales climbed 14 percent to 96.9 billion pesos, missing the average estimate of 99.7 billion pesos of five analysts polled by Bloomberg. \n \n Walmex CEO Scot Rank and Chief Financial Officer Rafael Matute didn’t mention the corruption investigation yesterday on a seven-minute conference call to discuss first-quarter results. As usual, the company didn’t take questions from analysts or investors on the quarterly call. \n \n Settlements involving the corrupt practices act are typically 1 percent to 2 percent of sales, and that would be about $4.5 billion per 1 percentage point of sales for Wal-Mart, Carroll said. FCPA investigations take 2 years to 6 years to settle, he said. The largest such settlement ever was $1.6 billion paid by Siemens AG (SIE) in 2008, he said. \n \n Wal-Mart executives, including then-Chief Executive Officer and current board member Lee Scott, were made aware of the bribery allegations in 2005, the New York Times reported. So was Duke, the current CEO, who at the end of that year was just taking over international operations, the article said. \n \n Scott didn’t return a phone call to his home. \n \n Congressional Scrutiny \n \n Two top Democrats on congressional panels yesterday moved to start a probe and request a meeting with Wal-Mart executives. \n \n The Times report “raises serious questions about potential violations of United States law” and “about the actions of top company officials in the United States who reportedly tried to disregard substantial evidence of abuse,” Representatives Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Henry Waxman of California, wrote in a letter to Duke. \n \n Cummings is the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Waxman is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \n \n Wal-Mart will face pressure from shareholders to take action against any executives who didn’t act fully on the bribery allegations sooner, said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \n \n ‘It’s Problematic’ \n \n “If this is all true, it’s problematic,” Elson said in a telephone interview. “If any officer was significantly involved, their position has to be reviewed. You have to do the investigating and determine what did the CEO know and when.” \n \n The Times article said the bribes may have amounted to more than $24 million in payments. \n \n The Times identified executive Eduardo Castro-Wright as a central figure in the expansion of the alleged payments. Castro- Wright ran Wal-Mart de Mexico as CEO from 2003 to 2005 and was president and chief operating officer of the unit from 2001 to 2003. Some of the alleged bribery took place during that time, the newspaper reported. \n \n In a telephone interview, Tovar declined to discuss the future of Castro-Wright, who is now a Wal-Mart vice chairman scheduled to retire July 1. \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: David Welch in Detroit at dwelch12@bloomberg.net; Thom Weidlich in New York at tweidlich@bloomberg.net; Seth Stern in Washington at sstern14@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net; Steven Komarow at skomarow1@bloomberg.net']",2,"– Walmart is under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice over allegations that it doled out millions in bribes to Mexican officials in order to grow its business there more quickly, sources tell Bloomberg and the Washington Post. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits companies from paying foreign officials in an effort to increase business, and if Walmart is found to be in violation of FCPA, the company could face executive departures, slowed expansion in Mexico and other markets, and penalties that could be ""incredibly high,"" says one lawyer. In a note to employees yesterday, Walmart CEO Mike Duke said the company is conducting its own ""aggressive investigation"" into the allegations; in an earlier statement, a VP had noted that ""many of the alleged activities ... are more than six years old.

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn\'t transferred on Jan. 1 doesn\'t mean it was frozen. ""There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,” the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway ""in light of the Palestinians\' recent conduct."" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general António Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories — the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza — are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n “The humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,"" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we\'re hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can\'t be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister\'s office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn\'t cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers “gradual disengagement"" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister\'s office said in a statement: ""Netanyahu supports President Trump\'s critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.""', 'This is the full text of the Articles of Impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1974. \n \n Note: The articles of impeachment were passed only by the Committee on the Judiciary.

NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF ITS IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HIM FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS. ARTICLE 1 In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his consitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, in that: On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence. Subsequent thereto, Richard M. Nixon, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entry; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities. The means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following: making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counselling witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings; interfering or endeavouring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and Congressional Committees; approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities; endeavouring to misuse the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the United States; disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability; making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the President, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct: or endeavouring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony.

Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purposed of these agencies. This conduct has included one or more of the following: He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavoured to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposed not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be intitiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner. He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and other executive personnel, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct or continue electronic surveillance or other investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; he did direct, authorize, or permit the use of information obtained thereby for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; and he did direct the concealment of certain records made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of electronic surveillance. He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the President, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial. He has failed to take care that the laws were faithfully executed by failing to act when he knew or had reason to know that his close subordinates endeavoured to impede and frustrate lawful inquiries by duly constituted executive, judicial and legislative entities concerning the unlawful entry into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, and the cover-up thereof, and concerning other unlawful activities including those relating to the confirmation of Richard Kleindienst as Attorney General of the United States, the electronic surveillance of private citizens, the break-in into the offices of Dr. Lewis Fielding, and the campaign financing practices of the Committee to Re-elect the President. In disregard of the rule of law, he knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Division, and the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore Richard M. Nixon, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office. Adopted 28-10 by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.', 'President Donald Trump, or any other commander in chief, can\'t be found guilty of obstructing justice because the Constitution says so, according to one of Trump’s top lawyers. \n \n John Dowd, among several attorneys representing the president, told Axios that the Constitution makes Trump the nation\'s top cop, so by definition the president ""cannot obstruct justice, because he is the chief law enforcement officer,"" Dowd said. He added that Trump ""has every right to express his view of any case."" \n \n The latter comment refers to Trump\'s tweets dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe into the Trump campaign\'s alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. Most recently, Michael Flynn, the president\'s former national security adviser and campaign aide, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI, and one day later, Trump\'s Twitter account posted a comment that could help bolster a case of obstruction: \n \n “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!” Trump posted, the first time he suggested he knew Flynn lied to investigators. \n \n The tweet could be seen as evidence of obstruction of justice because Trump later reportedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to “let” the Flynn thing “go."" \n \n Dowd said that he wrote the tweet. Not that it matters, because the president can\'t be found guilty of obstruction, the lawyer claims. \n \n It’s not clear which section of the Constitution\'s Article II Dowd was referencing, though Section Two does read: “ The president] may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.” \n \n Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now \n \n But according to Dowd, the tweet was the furthest thing from an admission of guilt or obstruction. \n \n ""The tweet did not admit obstruction. That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion,” Dowd told Axios. \n \n Dowd’s comments hark back to former President Richard Nixon’s defense of his actions in office. Nixon, who resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached, famously said during his interviews with British journalist David Frost in 1977 that “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” \n \n REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan \n \n In Nixon’s case, he was talking about the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, while Trump’s case involves the president’s powers over the Justice Department. Trump lamented in November that the “saddest thing” about being president is that he is “not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department” and the “FBI.” \n \n Trump then asked why the Justice Department was not going after his former presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her private email server scandal. He also wondered why the department was not investigating Clinton’s campaign for hiring the company that created the infamous Trump-Russia dossier that has dogged Trump’s first year in office.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron: ""There\'s not going to be a G8 summit this year in Russia"" \n \n The G8 summit will not take place in Russia this year, UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said. \n \n Speaking in the Netherlands, Mr Cameron said it was ""absolutely clear"" the planned June meeting of world leaders in the Russian resort of Sochi would not happen owing to events in Ukraine. \n \n The EU and US have imposed sanctions on Russian officials after Russia\'s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \n \n Moscow has also been warned of further action if it does not change course. \n \n The announcement that the Sochi meeting had been effectively cancelled came after Russian troops seized control of the last major military base in Crimea. \n \n Mr Cameron, US President Barack Obama and other G8 leaders are attending a nuclear co-operation summit in The Hague, to which Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited. \n \n \'Illegal annexation\' \n \n ""We should be clear there\'s not going to be a G8 summit in Russia,"" Mr Cameron said, urging Russia to ""change course"". \n \n The G7 leaders plus EU representatives issued a declaration after their meeting in The Hague noting that ""international law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state\'s territory through coercion or force"". \n \n Image copyright AFP \n \n ""To do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built,"" they said. \n \n ""We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine\'s constitution. We also strongly condemn Russia\'s illegal attempt to annex Crimea in contravention of international law and specific international obligations. We do not recognise either."" \n \n Russia\'s actions would have ""significant consequences"", they continued. \n \n ""We remain ready to intensify actions including coordinated sectoral sanctions that will have an increasingly significant impact on the Russian economy, if Russia continues to escalate this situation. \n \n ""Russia has a clear choice to make. Diplomatic avenues to de-escalate the situation remain open, and we encourage the Russian government to take them."" \n \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said there was an increasing recognition that European leaders wanted to stop relying so heavily on Russian oil and gas. \n \n The G7 had to be prepared to take more far-reaching measures in response to the developments, he said. \n \n The UK and other G8 nations suspended their preparations for the Sochi summit last month as the crisis in Ukraine intensified and hinted that they could meet without Russia. \n \n Several G8 members have also called for Russia\'s membership of the powerful body to be suspended. \n \n The BBC\'s Europe correspondent Matthew Price said the end of the Sochi summit was a recognition of Russia\'s isolation on the global stage as a result of what it had done in Ukraine. \n \n The US, UK and other countries, he added, were making clear they did not want Russia ""in their club"" unless it reconsidered its actions in Crimea.']",5,"– The Trump attorney who says he penned the ""sloppy"" tweet that some say indicates a possible obstruction of justice isn't done making headlines. John Dowd spoke to Axios' Mike Allen, scoffing at criticism of the tweet regarding Mike Flynn, which suggested Trump knew the former national security adviser had lied to the FBI before Trump canned James Comey. ""The tweet did not admit obstruction,"" Dowd says. ""That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion."" Plus, the Constitution has Trump's back, per Dowd. ""[The] president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution's Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,"" he claims. Newsweek notes it's not clear which section of Article II Dowd refers to, though it speculates on one part involving the president seeking the opinion ""of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices."" Allen notes that with this pronouncement, Trump's legal team is ""setting the stage"" to keep Trump insulated from obstruction of justice or collusion charges in the Russia probe—meaning, Allen speculates, that his lawyers may be nervous charges are coming down the pike. But one of Barack Obama's former counsels notes ""it is certainly possible"" for Trump to have obstructed justice, and Allen points out Richard Nixon's Articles of Impeachment were jump-started with the assertion that Nixon ""has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice."" But whether Trump can or can't be held responsible for such a transgression may be moot, Allen adds. ""The one thing everyone agrees on is that the House of Representatives, with its impeachment power, alone decides what is cause for removal from office,"" he writes. ""For now, at least, the House is run by Republicans."""

Vorobyeva said... (Associated Press) \n \n The crash site itself, in farmland held by the pro-Russian separatists who the West accuses of shooting down the plane, remained unsecured five days after the disaster — another source of frustration for officials around the world eager to establish the facts of the case. \n \n After an overnight journey, a refrigerated train carrying the bodies pulled into a station in Kharkiv, a government-controlled city where Ukrainian authorities have set up their crash investigation center. Government spokesman Oleksander Kharchenko said Ukraine ""will do our best"" to send the bodies to the Netherlands on Tuesday. Of the 298 people who died aboard the Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur flight, 193 were Dutch citizens. \n \n In Brussels, European Union foreign ministers were discussing whether to impose more sanctions in response to the disaster. Europe and the United States have imposed targeted economic sanctions against Russia for supporting Ukraine\'s five-month insurgency that began after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted by protesters in February. \n \n The rebels control a swathe of territory in two eastern provinces, and have battled Ukrainian troops with heavy weapons including tanks and missile launchers that the West says came from Russia. Russia denies supporting the insurgency. \n \n The sanctions so far have focused on individuals instead of entire sectors of the economy, though the EU was moving already to broaden them before the downing of the plane. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday that the jet\'s destruction on Thursday has drastically changed the situation, and that the Russians cannot expect continued access to European markets and capital if they continued to fuel a war against another European country. \n \n Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius blamed ""terrorists supplied by Moscow"" for shooting down the airliner, killing all aboard. He said he hoped the EU will impose beefed-up sanctions on Russia. His call for an arms embargo was a direct challenge to France, which is building two warships for the Russian navy. \n \n At the crash site near the village of Hrabove, a few rebel fighters accompanied observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The farmland where the wreckage is scattered was otherwise unguarded and unsecured. Even the red-and-white tape that had sealed off the fields had been torn away. \n \n In some places, the smell of decay and flies suggested the presence of remains under the wreckage, and observers said Monday that not all bodies had been recovered. \n \n About 70 villagers, most of them older women wearing headscarves, gathered across the road from the site to sing Ukrainian Orthodox hymns at a memorial service led by several black-robed priests. \n \n ___ \n \n Dahlburg contributed from Brussels. Also contributing were David McHugh in Kiev and Lucien Kim in Hrabove, Ukraine.', 'From a cavernous situation room inside the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Lieutenant-General set out Russia\'s version of events. \n \n The briefing was carried live on Russian state TV and handed out on DVDs by Russia\'s ambassador to Malaysia. \n \n They claim to have detected a Ukrainian military aircraft within 3-5km of the Malaysian Airliner on Thursday. \n \n Russian ambassador to Malaysia, Lyudmila Vorobyeva \n \n ""The SU-25 fighter jet can gain an altitude of 10km, according to its specification,"" Lt Gen Kartopolov explained (which happens to be the exact altitude at which MH17 was flying). \n \n ""It\'s equipped with air-to-air R-60 missile that can hit a target at a distance up to 12km, up to 5km for sure. \n \n ""We would like to get an explanation as to why the military jet was flying along a civil aviation corridor at almost the same time and at the same level as a passenger plane."" \n \n They also claim to have detected an unusual increase in Ukrainian radar activity leading up to the incident, and that the airliner came down ""within the operating zone"" of Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile defences. \n \n He showed satellite images of a Ukrainian base close to Donetsk, pointing out that its surface-to-air missile units were missing on the day of the crash. \n \n He then appeared to claim that one of the units had moved into rebel-controlled territory on the morning of the crash. \n \n Finally, Russia categorically denied supplying the rebels with Buk surface-to-air missile systems, or indeed any other weaponry. \n \n Now, firstly, it\'s worth saying there is a propaganda war in both directions here, which has been going on for several months, and that both sides are pursuing interests beyond the immediate tragedy of MH17. \n \n A Russian Buk missile launcher \n \n But the questions Russia presents ""that Kiev must answer"" raise a few questions themselves. \n \n The SU-25 ""fighter jet"" Russia claims to have identified close to the airliner is a ground attack aircraft - according to its manufacturer its maximum service height, without weapons, is 7,000m - 3km short of MH17. \n \n As Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer pointed out, it\'s also too slow: ""They should have at least claimed it was an SU-27,"" he said. \n \n And if the rebels don\'t have the Buk missile system, or indeed any other Russian-supplied weaponry - how did they target the dozen Ukrainian military aircraft they have previously boasted of shooting down? \n \n This included an Antonov-26 transport aircraft, flying at an altitude of 6,500m last week. \n \n Part of the wreckage at the crash site in Ukraine \n \n It is possible of course that the rebels have acquired weapons from Ukrainian military bases, although the government in Kiev insists it can account for all of its missile systems. \n \n And what exactly is the case Russia is setting out? Is it suggesting the Ukrainian SU-25 (despite its technical limitations) shot down the passenger jet in mid-air? \n \n And why? The plane would seem to have been travelling in the wrong direction for Ukrainian forces to have perceived it as a hostile aircraft coming from Russia, and the rebels don\'t have an air force. \n \n So are they seriously suggesting the Ukrainians deliberately moved their missiles on to rebel-held territory and shot the airliner down as part of some sort of nefarious plan to frame the rebels and turn world opinion against them? \n \n But then Russia doesn\'t need to prove its case - all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim. \n \n In much the same manner as a criminal defence barrister, Russia doesn\'t have to demonstrate that its alleged client is innocent - just to establish enough doubt in the minds of the jury - in this case the international community - that they can\'t be completely sure.', 'View Slideshow Ukrainian emergency workers carry a victim\'s body in a plastic bag at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 near the village of Hrabove in eastern Ukraine on Monday.

Former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall joins the News Hub with Sara Murray with details. Photo: Getty Images. \n \n The elaborate, televised Defense Ministry presentation—at odds with Western and Ukrainian accusations that Kremlin-backed insurgents shot down the plane—came as the U.S. and Russia clashed at the U.N. Security Council on Monday. There, both countries voted in favor of a unanimous resolution that condemned the downing of the jet and called for an independent international investigation into the incident. (Follow the latest updates on the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine.) \n \n Russia sought to use both forums to push back against growing international criticism and U.S. and Ukrainian assertions that Moscow could have provided the missile system that brought down the plane. American officials charged that the Russian version of events was a propaganda effort aimed at slowing the international community\'s response to the geopolitical crisis—or weakening proposed new sanctions to punish Moscow for its role in the conflict. \n \n At the news conference broadcast from Moscow, Russian air force chief Lt. Gen. Igor Makushev didn\'t say outright who the ministry thought had fired the missile that apparently brought down the airliner Thursday. Nor did he provide any photographic, radar or satellite evidencethat would show a missile track. \n \n But he said that Russian radar had spotted a second aircraft in the ill-fated airliner\'s vicinity just before the crash and that it was likely a Ukrainian fighter jet. A graphic that Gen. Makushev said was based on radar data depicted four commercial planes in the area shortly before the crash, as well as the alleged Ukrainian fighter jet. (View an interactive seating chart of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.) \n \n His presentation also suggested an alternative theory, that satellite imagery showed Ukraine also had moved missile systems into the area before the incident. The air force chief presented several slides of satellite images he said showed the Ukrainian missile-system movements. \n \n The suggested version of events echoed much of what has been reported on Russian state television in recent days, which has suggested that Ukraine could have shot down the plane, possibly via one of its fighter planes. \n \n U.S. officials dismissed the Russian government\'s claim that a second plane was present when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down last week as ""desperate"" propaganda. \n \n U.S. officials didn\'t provide their own evidence to back their arguments. But they pointed to Ukraine\'s statements Monday that the country\'s fighter jets were on the ground at the time of the crash. \n \n U.S. officials also said that Ukrainian fighters can\'t operate at 30,000 feet, where Flight 17 was cruising. ""The Russian government has a propaganda machine second to none, as these latest conspiracy theories demonstrate,"" one U.S. official said. \n \n The Obama administration reiterated its findings that Russia was the likely supplier of advanced SA-11 antiaircraft missiles to separatists, who fired it at the Malaysia Airlines jetliner. The White House said that an international case was building that indicated Russian complicity in the tragedy. \n \n ""What\'s clear is that there is a picture that\'s coming into focus,"" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. ""And Russian claims to the contrary are getting both more desperate and much harder to believe."" \n \n The war of words spilled over into the U.N. Security Council, where after the resolution vote, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power and Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin gave sharply different versions of who was likely responsible for shooting down the Boeing 777 on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board. \n \n ""Russia has begun to blame Ukraine itself for the attack though the missile came from separatist territory that Russia knows full well Ukraine has not yet reclaimed,"" Ms. Power said. \n \n ""Russia must recognize that no move on the geopolitical chessboard with the West can offset the pain being felt by the passengers\' families,"" she said. \n \n But Mr. Churkin chastised Ms. Power in the council chamber, saying, ""There can be no jumping to conclusions or political statements here."" \n \n Mr. Churkin said Ukraine would have to answer to international investigators regarding the activities of its air-traffic controllers, why a Ukrainian antiaircraft missile battery in the area of the crash was ""hastily removed,"" and why Ukrainian radar was operating ""at an all-time high"" on the day of the incident. He also accused Ukraine of ""touching up"" intercepted phone calls of rebel commanders with audio from before the date of the crash. \n \n Kiev has dismissed Russian claims that it could have been involved, and Ukraine\'s security service has posted intercepted phone calls that it says are of pro-Russia rebel commanders discussing having shot down a plane they discovered afterward was a civilian aircraft. Moscow and the rebels have denied this. \n \n International forensic experts on Monday inspect the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines jet that was shot down in eastern Ukraine last week. Associated Press \n \n The U.S., which has largely backed Kiev\'s version of events, has said its intelligence analysts have evaluated a number of the audio recordings and said they were authentic. \n \n Earlier on Monday, Gen. Makushev said that the two Russian radar stations near Russia\'s border with Ukraine observed the presence of the second aircraft over a period of four minutes on the day of Flight 17\'s crash. These stations couldn\'t identify the aircraft because it mostly likely wasn\'t equipped with the system of secondary identification of aircrafts, ""which is characteristic of fighter jets,"" he said. \n \n Gen. Makushev said that Russian radars could only spot the aircraft at the point of its ascension because the on-duty radars only detected objects at above 5,000 meters. Russian radars spotted the unidentified plane patrolling in the vicinity of Flight 17, ""controlling the development of the situation,"" he said. \n \n The defense ministry also said it registered the Su-25 fighter jet ascending within close range of several civil aircrafts, including the Malaysia Airlines jet. \n \n Another top military official, Lt. Gen. Andrei Kartapolov, said at the same news conference that the jet came as close as 1.8 miles to Flight 17, which is well within the range of the air-to-air missiles it is usually equipped with. \n \n Interactives \n \n Gen. Makushev also showed satellite photos allegedly showing several Buk-M1 ground-to-air missile systems in the area close to where the plane crashed. The systems, he argued, could only belong to the Ukrainian military. The Buks were spotted in Luhansk and Donetsk by Russians, Gen. Kartapolov said, in the days leading up to the crash. \n \n Ukrainian officials have said its own Buk systems were well out of range, and have accused Russia of giving the rebels a Buk system, which then shot down the airliner. Russia denies this. \n \n Public tracking website Flightradar24 followed Flight 17 from its departure from Amsterdam through to its final moments over Ukraine. The aircraft was observed to be roughly 10 miles north of the L980 jetway that was a part of its filed flight plan. Such a deviation isn\'t unusual, though, and can be affected by weather. \n \n Similarly, Gen. Makushev said the Malaysia Airlines plane deviated from its course by close to 9 miles near Donetsk but then attempted to return to its course, crashing shortly after. Russian radars spotted the Flight 17 rapidly descending 32 miles away from the Russian border, Russian officials said. \n \n He said Russia is prepared to hand all of the information it has to the European authorities, which included satellite imagery and data from its own radar. \n \n Russian defense ministry officials also claimed that a U.S. satellite was spotted at the time of the Flight 17 crash and asked that the U.S. release the satellite images from that time. The U.S. didn\'t immediately comment on the claim. \n \n —Joe Lauria \n \n and Julian E.

But Moscow, in the meantime, sought to cast doubt on the generally accepted theory that pro-Russian separatists were to blame, reports the Wall Street Journal. At an official briefing last night, the defense ministry said that its radar spotted a second aircraft in the vicinity and that it was probably a Ukraine fighter jet, which could have shot down the plane. The air force chief also suggested that a Ukraine missile system could have hit the plane from the ground, and he said satellite imagery suggested that Ukraine had been moving such systems into the area. He offered no proof, but as Katie Stallard at Sky News writes, ""Russia doesn't need to prove its case—all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim."" Meanwhile, the refrigerated train carrying passengers arrived in the Ukraine town of Kharkiv, reports the AP.

A search effort involving divers, helicopters and ships has been under way along the identified route since Friday. \n \n The Danish inventor has been charged with negligent manslaughter. The police say they cannot release any more information at this time. \n \n Peter Madsen\'s lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said her client had not admitted any wrongdoing. She said he had given evidence to the police during preliminary questioning and ""information from this"" had now emerged. \n \n ""My client has not confessed to anything, my client still pleads not guilty to the charges against him,"" she said. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police believe Mr Madsen deliberately sank the submarine \n \n Ms Wall, a 30-year-old journalist who wrote for several international publications, was first reported missing by her boyfriend after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip on the UC3 Nautilus submarine. \n \n She had been researching a feature about Mr Madsen and his 40-tonne submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. \n \n Police believe the submarine was deliberately sunk by Mr Madsen, who was rescued before being arrested. \n \n Mr Madsen initially said he dropped Ms Wall off after dark on 10 August, close to where they had met earlier. But police later said he had given them a new account of events, which was not made public at the time.', 'Danish police say the freelance Swedish journalist Kim Wall died aboard the do-it-yourself UC3 Nautilus submarine captained by inventor Peter Madsen, who had initially claimed to have dropped her off at the tip of a Copenhagen island. After over a week of denying any role in Wall\'s disappearance, on Monday he admitted to dumping her body into the ocean. \n \n Madsen ""told police and the court that there was an accident on board the sub that led to the death of Kim Wall, and that he subsequently buried her at sea in an undefined location of the Koge Bay,"" approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Copenhagen, officers reported in a statement. \n \n Last week, Danish authorities upgraded an initial charge of involuntary negligent manslaughter against Madsen, who owned and designed the amateur-built submarine - the biggest homemade underwater boat ever when it first took to the seas in 2008.

Though details are still scarce, Copenhagen police say Peter Madsen, after changing his story, has confessed that Kim Wall died in ""an accident"" on board his Nautilus sub and that he then ""buried her at sea,"" the BBC reports. Officials have been searching for Wall since her disappearance on Aug. 10, when she boarded Madsen's sub, which then sank off of Denmark's Refshaleoen island. Madsen initially claimed he had dropped Wall off after they'd cruised around for about three hours, but in a police statement cited by the Local, that story has since been modified. ""The accused has told police and the court that an accident occurred on board the submarine which caused Kim Wall’s death, and that he subsequently buried her at sea at an unspecified location somewhere in Koge Bay,"" reads the statement in the closed-door case. Madsen's explanation was released after a defense and prosecution request. Although the statement also notes that ""current charges remain in place,"" it's unclear what those charges are: Deutsche Welle notes that Madsen was originally charged with negligent manslaughter, but it's now reporting a new charge of aggressive manslaughter, which it says can lead to a prison sentence of up to eight years. A search for Wall's body in the newly pinpointed area is now underway."

Snoop noted that the site will be enlisting celebrities that are “down with the team” including Seth Rogen and Miley Cyrus. \n \n But beyond that, Merry Jane will also take a hard editorial look at the business and politics of the cannabis industry, breaking news about legalization, policy, and industry growth. \n \n And that’s just the start of it. \n \n Merry Jane also connects to its own database around various strains of cannabis, created by a Merry Jane editorial team, letting users learn more about the strain that might be right for them, and then connecting that reader/user with a local dispensary where they can procure said herbal supplement. \n \n But unlike other platforms that help inform the reader about different types of greenery, Merry Jane makes it super easy to search for what you’re looking for, whether it’s a wax, edible, or flower. Users can search by type of cannabis, flavors, symptoms, and more, with high-res rotating imagery for every product listed. \n \n Pre-launch, Snoop and Chung curated dispensaries to put on the platform, but eventually dispensaries will be able to log in to the back end and upload their own menus, update them, and maintain control over their own digital storefront via Merry Jane. \n \n When asked about the business plan for the site, MJ cofounder Ted Chung said that “advertising is definitely part of the plan,” but noted that the most important thing is providing the marijuana business with a definitive destination for brands and retail locations to create a strong presence. In terms of user acquisition, Chung said that the demand is already there, and expects the site to surpass its competitors within 6 months. \n \n Snoop also said that Merry Jane will be the door to bring people out of the closet. “There are so many people in the closet, and we are giving them an opportunity to come out of the closet and just admit they like to smoke. I’m a smoker, my name is Snoop Dogg, and I’m a stoner.” \n \n Merry Jane is launching at today’s Disrupt SF 2015 conference, with a limited amount of beta testers receiving invites today.

171,"['BEIJING (AP) — China\'s government warned Wednesday it will retaliate if Washington imposes new trade penalties, following a report the Trump administration will propose increasing the tariff rate on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports. \n \n A foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Beijing was ready for ""dialogue and consultation"" to defuse the escalating dispute. \n \n ""If the United States takes further measures that escalate the situation, China will definitely fight back,"" said Geng. He gave no details of possible measures but said, ""we are determined to safeguard our legitimate and lawful rights and interests."" \n \n Washington imposed additional 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods July 6 in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing responded by imposing the same penalties on the same amount of U.S. imports. \n \n Bloomberg News reported, citing three unidentified sources, the Trump administration would propose imposing 25 percent tariffs on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods targeted in a new round of penalties, up from the planned 10 percent. \n \n Geng gave no indication whether the two sides were preparing to resume negotiations. \n \n ""I need to stress that dialogues must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and equality,"" he said. ""Unilateral threats and pressure will only be counterproductive."" \n \n The Ministry of Commerce didn\'t respond to questions by phone and fax about the status of possible negotiations.', '(CNN) The Trump administration plans to raise pending tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, a source familiar with discussions confirmed to CNN. \n \n The news was first reported by Bloomberg. \n \n The move, which is not finalized and could change, according to the source, comes as the United States and China remain locked in a trade war. Talks between US and Chinese officials have done little to ease tensions. \n \n The United States has already imposed 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion. China immediately responded with its own tariffs on US goods worth $34 billion. \n \n A second round of tariffs on products worth $16 billion could take effect as soon as this week. \n \n Read More', 'LISTEN TO ARTICLE 4:34 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n The U.S. and China are trying to restart talks aimed at averting a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies, two people familiar with the effort said. \n \n Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations, according to the people who spoke about the deliberations on condition of anonymity. \n \n They cautioned that a specific timetable, the issues to be discussed and the format for talks aren’t finalized, but added there was agreement among the principals that more discussions need to take place. \n \n Negotiations to resolve the dispute have been stalled for weeks, with both sides refusing to budge. High-level U.S. talks on the Trump administration’s trade posture toward China are taking place this week, according to a third person who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n \n U.S. stocks closed higher as the prospects for an easing in trade tensions lifted industrial shares, with Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc. and 3M Co. all adding more than 1 percent. \n \n The next wave of U.S. tariffs is set to kick in as soon as Wednesday, with the possible imposition of duties on another $16 billion of Chinese imports. The implementation could be delayed for weeks as the administration works out the details of which products it will target. Officials in Beijing have vowed to respond with the same amount of tariffs on U.S. products. \n \n One person familiar with the internal deliberations said the U.S. is trying to secure certain concessions and if China agrees, it is possible the U.S. would back off additional tariffs. \n \n Complicating Mnuchin’s efforts is a harder line taken by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has jurisdiction over the U.S.’s 301 investigation that sparked the tariffs. That case concluded China was stealing American technology and tariffs were needed to offset the damage. \n \n A U.S. Treasury spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment. \n \n ‘Chronic Problem’ \n \n U.S. and Chinese officials have given little recent indication in public that a restart to negotiations might be in the offing. Lighthizer said last week that trade tensions with China are a “chronic problem,” while China’s representative at the World Trade Organization accused the U.S. of “extortion.” \n \n The two sides held three rounds of formal talks, beginning with a delegation to Beijing led by Mnuchin in May. After Liu visited Washington later that month, the nations released a joint statement pledging to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, among other things. But within days, President Donald Trump himself backed away from the deal, saying talks would “probably have to use a different structure.” \n \n Negotiations broke off after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports this month, a move the Chinese said would void any promises they’d made in negotiations. Beijing responded in kind with its own tariffs. \n \n Trump’s mission to reduce the U.S. trade deficit via the threat of tariffs has brought him into conflict with China as well as U.S. allies, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a global trade war the International Monetary Fund has warned may undermine the strongest economic upswing in years. \n \n ZTE Deal \n \n Chinese and U.S. officials have struggled to find a starting place for a new round of talks. After taking a hard line on Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp., the Trump administration this month finished a deal that allowed the company to stay in business. Trump said the pact was a personal favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping. \n \n In exchange for the U.S. letting ZTE survive, Chinese regulators were expected to approve a deal between San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. and rival chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV, based in Eindhoven, Netherlands. \n \n Mnuchin was among the Cabinet officials involved in a last-minute effort early last week to get the Qualcomm-NXP deal approved before the companies vowed to walk away from it on July 25, the people said. Mnuchin’s efforts were unsuccessful and Qualcomm scrapped its $44 billion bid for NXP. \n \n The people familiar with the U.S.-China dispute said the U.S. has privately expressed dismay to the highest levels of the Chinese government that the deal fell through. \n \n Politburo Shift \n \n In a sign the trade standoff is reverberating through Chinese politics, the Politburo signaled Tuesday that policy makers will focus more on supporting economic growth amid risks from a campaign to reduce debt and the dispute with Trump. \n \n The communique, which followed a meeting of the country’s 25 most senior leaders led by Xi, said the nation’s campaign to reduce leverage will continue at a measured pace while improving economic policies to make them more forward-looking, flexible and effective in the second half of 2018. \n \n — With assistance by Andrew Mayeda']",3,"– The US in early July hit $34 billion of Chinese goods with an extra 25% tariff; China responded in kind. CNN reports round two could see the US slap tariffs on another $16 billion in goods as soon as this week, but it's a much bigger figure that's attracting attention Wednesday. Bloomberg cites sources who say the White House is thinking about upping the ante and imposing not an additional 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods but an additional 25%. CNN echoes that news via its source. Bloomberg frames the move, which would be revealed in the next couple of weeks, as intended to ""force officials back to the negotiating table through threats of even higher tariffs""; the last high-level negotiations took place nearly two months ago.

The third was jailed for six months for posting the rape on Facebook and failing to report it. \n \n Analysis: Leo Kelion, BBC technology desk editor \n \n This latest atrocity comes less than a fortnight after a US man bragged on Facebook Live about his murder of a 74-year-old man in Cleveland, having also posted a video of the killing to the social network. \n \n The platform\'s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently acknowledged he had ""a lot of work"" to do after it emerged the murder clip had remained online for more than two hours despite Facebook having received complaints in the meantime. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Zuckerberg commented on the Cleveland killing at a conference last week \n \n Prior to that, Facebook Live broadcast the death of a Chicago man who was shot in the neck and head last June, and then in July a woman streamed the death of her boyfriend after he was shot by police in Minneapolis. \n \n There have also been reports of sexual assaults, animal abuse and teenage suicide having been shown. \n \n For its part, Facebook is trying to find ways for its review team - which employs thousands of people - to react to such content more quickly. \n \n In addition, the firm has developed software to prevent such footage being reshared in full on its service at a later point. \n \n And it is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence to automatically flag videos and photos that need to be reviewed rather than waiting for other users to report them. \n \n What it hasn\'t discussed is the idea of scrapping Facebook Live altogether. \n \n With Twitter and YouTube, among others, offering rival live-streaming products, doing so could put it at a disadvantage. \n \n But as a result, there will inevitably be further outrages and criticism because Facebook Live\'s popularity makes it all but impossible for the firm to keep a human eye over each broadcast.', 'In Thailand, there was broad anger over the crime, which the police said appeared to have been driven by jealousy.

Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, addressed the issue at a company conference this month in response to a case in which a man in Cleveland posted a video of himself shooting and killing a 74-year-old stranger. \n \n The deaths in Thailand highlight the global scope of the problem. As Facebook has pushed to further ensconce itself in the lives of its users, it has urged them to share their most intimate experiences on its site. That has resulted in a flood of posts and videos in different languages, cultural contexts and time zones across the world. Accidents and crimes have also occasionally shown up, and patrolling that has proved difficult. \n \n Last summer, an Italian wing-suit base jumper streamed his own death in an accident, while in January, three men in Sweden were arrested and accused of raping a woman and broadcasting it to a private Facebook group.

After the deputy fell, Miles stood over his body and emptied his .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol into the deputy\'s back, shooting 15 rounds, Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said Monday. \n \n The chilling allegations, seen by witnesses and caught on surveillance video, left dozens of police officers shaking their heads in disbelief as Miles made his first appearance in a Harris County courtroom on charges of capital murder. \n \n ""They found Deputy Darren Goforth face down in a pool of his own blood,"" Anderson told state District Judge Denise Collins. Anderson later told reporters that her office is looking into charges that were filed against Miles in Travis County. \n \n In that case, Miles was accused of viciously beating up a man at a Salvation Army shelter where he was apparently staying in Austin in 2012. The victim suffered a broken vertebrae. Several months after the alleged assault, Miles was declared mentally incompetent and sent to North Texas State Hospital. He was later returned to competency, according to Travis County records. The assault case was later dismissed. \n \n As theories swirled Monday about why Goforth was killed, court records reveal a long history of run-ins between Miles and police. In two of those crimes, he pleaded guilty to a physical altercation with a police officer. \n \n In 2005, he was charged with failure to identify himself to police officers. No other information about that misdemeanor was available Monday. Three months after that arrest, his mother filed charges against him for throwing a 19-inch television into a 60-inch TV during a fight with her. \n \n She told police they were arguing because the 20-year-old was living at her home and would not get a job, court records show. He spent three days in jail and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief in exchange for time served. \n \n A few months after that, Miles was charged with resisting arrest, accused of pushing a Harris County sheriff\'s deputy. He pleaded guilty to a class A misdemeanor and was sentenced to eight days in jail. \n \n A year later, he was arrested on New Year\'s Day for unlawful discharge of a firearm. In that case, police took away a 9mm handgun which was later destroyed. In that case, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in exchange for 15 days in jail. Months after that arrest, he was sentenced to 10 days in jail after pleading guilty to evading arrest after fleeing a Jersey Village police officer. Just days later, he was arrested for trespassing and sentenced to 10 days behind bars after admitting guilt. \n \n In 2009, he was charged with resisting arrest in a case where he hit a Houston-area police officer. Miles pleaded no contest in exchange for time served after spending six days in jail. \n \n Before ending up in Austin in 2012, Miles attended the University of Houston main campus in the spring of 2011, school officials said. No degree was awarded. \n \n After Miles was arraigned Monday, Anderson said investigators continue to look for a motive for Friday\'s shooting. \n \n ""We\'re going to try to figure out the motive, even though we don\'t have to prove it under Texas law,"" she said. ""Everybody sure would like to know the motive. I\'d love to know where he got the gun and how he got the gun."" \n \n In hushed tones around Houston\'s criminal courthouse, police officers of all stripes echoed Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman who, on Saturday, connected Goforth\'s death and other violence against law enforcement to anti-police rhetoric across the country. \n \n After Goforth was killed about 8:20 p.m. Friday, police started searching for vehicles matching the description of the gunman\'s truck, a red Ford extended cab with a distinctive trailer hitch. \n \n They found the truck in the driveway of Miles\' house less than a mile from the crime scene. A man at the house said Miles had left with his mother and while police were looking around, Miles came home. \n \n He told police he had two guns, but had recently gotten rid of his 9mm pistol. The other was in a blue bag in his garage. He declined to give police permission to go inside. When they returned with a search warrant, Anderson said, they found the loaded .40 caliber pistol where Miles said it was. \n \n There was also a box of bullets of the same brand used to kill Goforth. \n \n Ballistics experts said the gun was the same one that fired the shots at the gas station, Anderson said. \n \n She said Miles matched the description of the man on the surveillance video, and a witness to the crime later identified Miles as the shooter in a video line-up. \n \n In court Monday, Miles appeared in the yellow jail uniform typically reserved for high-profile inmates. He did not speak except to acknowledge that he understood the charges against him. \n \n The judge kept him in jail without bail and appointed defense attorneys Charles Brown and Anthony Osso who said they are just beginning to investigate the allegations. \n \n ""We\'re going to look at every aspect of this from mental health all the way down,"" Osso said. ""This is not a guy who has a long history of violent offenses."" \n \n Since the shooting, a makeshift memorial at the Chevron where 47-year-old Goforth was killed has overflowed with American flag balloons and flowers. More than 1,000 people attended a vigil for Goforth at the gas station Saturday and Sunday evenings, Anderson said. \n \n She dismissed questions about whether anti-police rhetoric or similar reasons were behind the shooting. \n \n ""People from all races, from all around the county — over 1,000 on both nights — came out to support law enforcement,"" she said. ""This crime is not going to divide us, this crime is going to unite us."" \n \n Anderson personally prosecuted Harlem Lewis last year, who was sentenced to death for the capital murder of Bellaire Police officer Jimmie Norman. Norman and a good samaritan named Terry Taylor were fatally shot during a traffic stop on Christmas Eve, 2012. \n \n Anderson said she had hoped Norman would be Harris County\'s last officer to be killed in the line of duty. \n \n ""I really never wanted to have to do this again,"" she told reporters. ""I can\'t believe Friday night I was out at a scene looking at an officer dead on the ground."" \n \n Goforth had been with the sheriff\'s office for 10 years and was stationed in District 5 in northwest Harris County. He had a wife and two children. On Monday, President Barack Obama released a statement that he had called Goforth\'s widow. \n \n ""On behalf of the American people, I offered Mrs. Goforth my condolences, and told her that Michelle and I would keep her and her family in our prayers,"" he said. ""I also promised that I would continue to highlight the uncommon bravery that police officers show in our communities every single day. They put their lives on the line for our safety. Targeting police officers is completely unacceptable — an affront to civilized society. As I said in my State of the Union Address, we\'ve got to be able to put ourselves in the shoes of the wife who won\'t rest until the police officer she married walks through the door at the end of his shift. That comfort has been taken from Mrs. Goforth. So we must offer her our comfort — and continue to stand up for the safety of police officers wherever they serve."" \n \n Goforth\'s funeral will be 11 a.m. Friday at Second Baptist Church, 6400 Woodway. There is a viewing an hour before. The officer will be buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, 8010 Katy Freeway. \n \n Chronicle reporter Jennifer Dlouhy contributed to this story.']",2,"– In the aftermath of a Texas sheriff's deputy's ""execution-style"" murder on Friday night, police explained that Darren Goforth was killed by a gunman who fired at him multiple times from behind a gas station. Suspected gunman Shannon Miles was today in court for the first time, and a prosecutor got even more specific about the circumstances of Goforth's death. ""He unloaded the entire weapon into Deputy Goforth,"" said Harris County DA Devon Anderson of Miles, per NBC News. That was 15 shots: a bullet in the chamber plus a 14-bullet clip. ""They found Deputy Darren Goforth face down in a pool of his own blood,"" continued Anderson, per the Houston Chronicle. She says 15 shell casings were found at the scene, and a .40 caliber handgun recovered from Miles' home proved a match for the bullets that killed Goforth. The Chronicle reports Miles, 30, didn't say much during his appearance, and was dressed in the yellow uniform given to high-profile inmates. He remains in jail without bail. A motive has yet to be given for the shooting. A GoFundMe campaign for Goforth's family (he has two kids) today surpassed its $100,000 goal."

176,"['Larry was completely naked and blindfolded next to a piano when the younger woman he was with had a breakthrough. She was 35 years old but gave off the nervous pent-up sexual energy of a wallflower at prom, and with good reason: She had never kissed a man, let alone seen one nude in her Long Beach home. \n \n She had been carefree and pretty as a teenager—until a car accident sent her flying through a windshield, slicing her face open and blinding her in one eye, according to Larry. Afterwards, she thought, How could anyone ever love me? So she shut herself off to the world, to romantic love and sex. Until now. \n \n It was summer 1994 and Larry, who was a decade her senior, had instructions. ""I want you to stare at me,"" he ordered softly. ""Be scared. Be curious. Be excited. If you\'re bored, that\'s good. We\'ll move on."" Soon they did, and—terrifying as it was—she stripped down, too. Then came kissing, caressing, and, eventually, sex. \n \n Read More: Learning How to Orgasm Without Any Touching \n \n \n \n Larry Villarin, a 62-year-old Californian, is not her boyfriend. Nor is he a sex worker, although technically he gets paid $150 per hour to have sex, hang out naked, and teach his clients the joys of the erotic. Larry is America\'s oldest male sexual surrogate, a job in which he risks being arrested in order to help others work through sexual dysfunction during one-on-one ""sessions."" In the past 35 years, the gig has matched him with dozens of women (and an occasional man) to achieve therapeutic goals. In the past, he says, he has worked with disabled clients, abuse survivors, and people from strict religions backgrounds, as well as with millionaires, geniuses, 40-year-old virgins, and powerful judges. Most of clients pair his hands-on therapy with trips to a psychologist in order to prepare for real-life intimacy. \n \n She needed to believe I wouldn\'t laugh at her or run away. It was beautiful to see her open up. \n \n Only ten men are certified to do this work in the U.S., according to the International Professional Surrogates Association (IPSA). Larry and other rare men in the field must undergo 100 hours of human sexuality studies before becoming certified by the IPSA, which connects patients with surrogates through psychiatrists. As a sexual surrogate, Larry must navigate tricky emotional turf, like what happens when a client falls in love with you, or how to gently bust through body hang-ups or deeply internalized anxieties. In the case of the 35-year-old woman who had survived a car accident, it turned out that she was mostly scared of ridicule. ""She needed to believe I wouldn\'t laugh at her or run away. It was beautiful to see her open up,"" he says. \n \n Most of Larry\'s job is far less sexy than it might seem. During their first hour-long session with him, clients unload their emotional baggage —ranging from social anxiety to PTSD — and set therapy goals. No sexual touching is allowed. If all goes well, they\'ll move to hand stroking and a face caressing. Later, he\'ll try a blindfolded ""trust walk"" to get them ""out of their heads."" \n \n His clients, who range in age from 22 to 75, usually invite Larry to their L.A. homes or come to his. Many are referred to him by a psychologist after reaching a frustrating impasse in expressing their sexuality: they can\'t become ""normal"" without a partner, and they can\'t find partner if they don\'t become ""normal."" The steamy stuff comes slowly— if at all. ""You set ground rules,"" Larry says, ""It\'s baby steps."" He works with some clients for weeks, others for years. Some are never ready to have full-blown sex. \n \n One of the tools Larry uses in order to help his clients open up is playing naked games. In one, he and the client stand back-to-back with their eyes closed. She opens her eyes first, then it\'s his turn. Eventually they go to a mirror and talk honestly about their reflections. It helps that Larry, a slow-talking old hippie type, is not at all physically threatening. ""I go first and stand in front of full-length mirror. I do an oral meditation, describing my body, tip to toe—how it feels and functions—totally honestly,"" he says. ""It really gets down to image. I say, \'I don\'t like my saggy buttocks,\' or \'I broke my toe when I was 20.\' I can do 30 minutes of that, just modeling openness. Then she goes."" \n \n She had her first orgasm. She didn\'t believe she could ever have one. I\'m getting misty about it. \n \n In addition, Larry says, physical exercises can lead to epiphanies. In one case, a 70-year-old woman had lived her whole life thinking sex was a chore; religious guilt kept her from masturbating. ""She was numb — her hips were frozen,"" Larry recalls. So he told her to stand with her legs apart. ""I said, \'Imagine a pencil coming down between your genitals and your anus. Now write your name on the floor. It required movements in her hips."" \n \n Later that night, she took a shower and lay naked on her sheets. A breeze from an open window rolled over her body, and something shifted in her pelvis. ""That\'s all it took. She had her first orgasm. She didn\'t believe she could ever have one. I\'m getting misty about it,"" Larry says. ""It\'s just: growth — what humans are capable of. Gosh, it\'s intimate stuff."" \n \n Larry claims that birthdays are the number-one reason women come to see him. Late-in-life virgins, turning 30 or 40, see the date looming and want to take the plunge. ""Milestones are a big one. It\'s anxiety provoking. Women will say, \'This my final hope,\'"" Larry says. \n \n Usually, those clients have control problems sparked by something early in life. If they don\'t address their issues with control, they tend to get worse, and their virginity becomes a symbol of everything wrong with them. ""They\'re embarrassed. Sometimes they can\'t talk to anyone about it,"" Larry notes. ""They try to fake it with girlfriends. But every new man has to be Mr. Right—perfect—so they run away at the first relationship glitch. The longer they wait, the more the anxiety builds."" \n \n [Birthdays] are a big one. It\'s anxiety provoking. Women will say, \'This my final hope.\' \n \n Emotional blocks can turn physical for some women. One client suffered from a condition called vaginismus, which caused her vaginal canal to tighten involuntarily, preventing sex. It was painful and embarrassing, so Larry recommended she use vaginal dilators for six months. Unlike a gynecologist, however, he paired that treatment with intimacy therapy and physical touch. It worked, he claims. \n \n Larry is a sort of a gateway guy, he says: He\'s low risk because he\'s not a real lover. ""The women are not there to please me; I\'m there for them. Somewhere along the line, they stopped trusting men. I have to undo that."" \n \n Although trust is deeply important to Larry\'s work, it\'s also important to keep an emotional distance. Larry says that some of his clients have fallen in love with him, which can push him into a tricky emotional and ethical gray area. \n \n One woman came to him, fresh out of an abusive marriage, on the heels of her son\'s death. She was sick of being alone and wanted to enjoy sex. ""We worked for two years. We had so many firsts together—she didn\'t want to let go,"" Larry recalls. When her sessions came to an end, Larry says, the client began sending him expensive gifts and kept trying to see him. ""I kind of knew she was in love with me. But I had to be ethical."" \n \n Not long after that, he set up new boundaries: He stopped allowing sessions in his own bedroom and built a ""therapy room"" instead. After one of his own romantic relationships ""fell apart because of the job,"" he took a break from it. Now, he sometimes holds back sharing with clients because, ""by telling [a client] too much about myself, I realized, I am burdening her."" \n \n The job is full of ethical landmines, according to Paula Hall, a British sex therapist. ""In the UK, the practice is mostly frowned upon,"" she says. The surrogate-client relationship is often seen as just too complicated, she adds. To Larry, however, the lines are clear enough. ""In a sense, we already know the relationship has to end. It\'s better that they learn how to be hurt with me, rather than a less sensitive man."" \n \n Romantic feelings aren\'t the only issue complicating Larry\'s profession: Paying for sex — any sex —is illegal in the U.S., and there\'s no law offering surrogates special protection. If a cop were to bust in on Larry during a session, he could be arrested, which is exactly what happened to one of his female surrogate friends. ""She was seeing a client and he turned out to be a cop,"" Larry says. ""He said, \'I have to confess: In 10 minutes you\'re going to hear a knock on the door, and you\'re going to be busted for prostitution, but I can see that\'s not what this is."" \n \n IPSA skirts prostitution law in certifying its members because it doesn\'t acknowledge intercourse is part of the practice, according to Larry and other current and former surrogates. Today, he\'s baffled that people don\'t understand the difference between his work, which he sees as primarily therapeutic or socially instructive. \n \n For instance, Larry once worked with a woman from a strict religious background. Because of her upbringing, she had learned to see kissing as strictly a sexual act, never used for casual affection. She enlisted Larry to teach her the basics of kissing in all different contexts. In their sessions, Larry says, she made the rules. ""We tried all of them: A quick kiss goodbye, a hello kiss, a marathon make out. I was never allowed to kiss back,"" he recounts. After a few weeks, she left feeling ""reborn,"" ready for lovers and friends. ""It did increase her confidence, oh my,"" Larry says. \n \n But most of the time, Larry never gets to see the positive affects of his work. ""The empowerment part comes when they leave me. It\'s like karate: Once you get your black belt, your training has just begun. With me, they\'ve opened their hearts — and now they can go have a life.""', ""Panic! at the Disco frontman Brendon Urie is giving new meaning to the band’s queer anthem “Girls/Girls/Boys.” In a new interview with Paper magazine, the musician opened up about his sexuality, identifying as pansexual. \n \n “I’m married to a woman and I’m very much in love with her, but I’m not opposed to a man because to me, I like a person,” Urie said. “I guess you could qualify me as pansexual because I really don’t care. If a person is great, then a person is great. I just like good people, if your heart’s in the right place. I’m definitely attracted to men. It’s just people that I am attracted to.” \n \n “I guess this is me coming out as pansexual,” he added. \n \n Urie has been recognized as an advocate for the LGBT community since Panic! dropped “Girls/Girls/Boys” in 2013 as part of the band’s fourth studio album, “Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!” The song, which is about a woman who loves both men and women, has since become a staple for Panic!’s live sets, during which fans wave pride flags and rainbow signs. \n \n “That song was about my first threesome, but they made it about coming out and accepting who you are as a person, which I thought, ‘What a way better message,'” Urie said. “Taking this thing that I wrote about and then changing it to be more inspiring for your own purposes — what a beautiful idea.” \n \n The singer also discussed what he used to call his “stage gay” persona, which he acknowledged has made some uncomfortable in the past. \n \n “For our first headline tour I would go up to Ryan, our guitar player, and like kiss him on the neck or kiss him on the mouth, and he would be so mad,” Urie said. “I was like, ‘I just want to kiss you, bro.’ I would hang out with friends and after five or six beers, we’re just kind of like smooching on each other.

177,"['Story highlights Authorities end cattle roundup, return livestock for safety reasons \n \n Troopers reopen northbound Interstate 15 about 80 miles outside Las Vegas \n \n ""Tensions are still near the boiling point,"" Sen. Heller says \n \n Some supporters of rancher were armed, authorities say \n \n A tense, weeklong showdown appeared to end Saturday between the federal government and supporters of a Nevada cattle rancher battling the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) over grazing rights on federal land. \n \n The BLM stopped rounding up rancher Cliven Bundy\'s cattle and returned about 300 head of cattle to the open range to avoid the potential for violence, according to the BLM and CNN affiliate KSNV. \n \n The Old West-style controversy -- centering on a family that has been ranching in Nevada since the 1800s -- drew armed militia groups from across the country to the cattleman\'s side this week, especially after a YouTube video captured a tussle teetering on violence between rangers and protesters. \n \n The BLM said Bundy owed about $1 million in back fees because his cattle grazed on federal land. \n \n On Saturday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the BLM\'s cattle gate, according to CNN affiliate KLAS. Some of them were armed. \n \n ""Due to escalating tensions, the cattle have been released from the enclosures in order to avoid violence and help restore order,"" the BLM said in a prepared statement. \n \n Also Saturday, supporters of Bundy, some of them armed, forced a temporary shutdown of northbound lanes of Interstate 15 near his ranch, the Nevada Highway Patrol said. \n \n ""Based on information about conditions on the ground, and in consultation with law enforcement, we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public,"" said BLM director Neil Kornze. \n \n The highway was reopened early Saturday afternoon after protesters moved to the side of the road and stopping blocking it. But traffic was backed up for three miles in both directions, Trooper Loy Hixson told CNN. He said nobody in the crowd threatened violence. \n \n It was unclear whether Bundy and the BLM had come to an agreement on how to end the long-running conflict. \n \n U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, appealed for calm Saturday and told out-of-state supporters to return home. \n \n ""The dispute is over, the BLM is leaving, but emotions and tensions are still near the boiling point, and we desperately need a peaceful conclusion to this conflict,"" Heller said in a statement. ""I urge all the people involved to please return to your homes and allow the BLM officers to collect their equipment and depart without interference. \n \n ""We are very close to a calm, peaceful resolution but it only takes the action of one individual to stir things up again and bring us back to the brink of violence and no one wants to see that happen,"" Heller said. \n \n The growing protest came amid the BLM\'s decision to put an early end to a roundup of Bundy\'s cattle, which the feds claim have been illegally grazing on federal land for 20 years. \n \n 18 photos: Photos: Showdown in Nevada 18 photos: Photos: Showdown in Nevada Photos: Showdown in Nevada – Rancher Cliven Bundy, right, leaves the podium with bodyguards after a news conference near his ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada, on Thursday, April 24.

MUST WATCH Feds and cattle ranchers face off 02:08 \n \n Earlier Saturday, Kornze said that contracted wranglers and U.S. rangers apparently made enough progress in rounding up cattle that belonged to Bundy, who is challenging federal authority in a valley that his family settled in the Wild West era. \n \n The roundup occurred near the scenic Virgin River at Bunkerville, where Bundy\'s ranch is located. \n \n ""After one week, we have made progress in enforcing two recent court orders to remove the trespass cattle from public lands that belong to all Americans,"" Kornze said in a statement. \n \n He was referring to how two different federal judges ordered the removal of Bundy\'s cattle. \n \n Bundy\'s dispute with the government began around 1993 when the bureau changed grazing rules for the 600,000-acre Gold Butte area to protect an endangered desert tortoise, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. \n \n Bundy, who\'s in his 60s, cites the Constitution in asserting that the state of Nevada holds sovereignty over the charging of grazing fees and, if he owes such a fee, he would pay it only to the local government -- not to the feds. \n \n Bundy also contends his family has been ranching in the Virgin Valley on the Nevada range since 1877 -- long before the BLM even existed and before the tortoise was declared endangered. \n \n Bundy has said he owns 500 of the more than 900 cattle that federal officials had been planning to confiscate for illegal grazing, according to local media accounts, with each head worth about $1,000. \n \n The rancher couldn\'t be immediately reached for comment Saturday after the feds shut down the roundup. \n \n On Wednesday, a scuffle between protesters and federal rangers was videotaped. \n \n Bundy family members and their supporters confronted the rangers and angrily told them to leave Nevada. Fearing that the cattle were being killed in the roundup, they also demanded to know why a backhoe and dump truck was being used, but federal officials later said the equipment was used to restore the range. \n \n For their part, federal rangers held Tasers and barking dogs on leashes during the faceoff. \n \n Federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted. Bundy family members say they were thrown to the ground or jolted with a Taser. \n \n In the end, the rangers got into their white SUVs and drove away, a YouTube video of the incident showed. \n \n The incident is under federal investigation. \n \n Gov. Brian Sandoval said Saturday of the BLM decision: ""The safety of all individuals involved in this matter has been my highest priority. Given the circumstances, today\'s outcome is the best we could have hoped for. I appreciate that the Department of the Interior and the BLM were willing to listen to the concerns of the people of Nevada."" \n \n Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Douglas C. Gillespie issued a press release late Saturday night saying he mediated the agreement between the Bundy familiy and BLM. \n \n ""I want to stress to all of you that as the sheriff of Clark County I cannot interfere with the Federal government when it is operating on Federal land,"" Gillespie said. ""And because this is BLM property, it is in their jurisdiction. But when a group of protesters threaten civil unrest or violence in this county -- it is my job to step in and ensure the safety of citizens.""', 'Walk the walk. And talk the talk. But don’t do the two simultaneously, unless you want to risk veering off course, according to a study by Stony Brook University researchers. \n \n Although it’s widely accepted that texting and talking on cell phones while driving can lead to accidents, researchers found texting will throw people off course and interfere with memory– even when walking. \n \n Although it may be self-evident that texting while walking will lead to distractions, Stony Brook researchers measured the impact. \n \n Related stories \n \n They said they were looking at how the brain handles, or runs into problems, handling the two simultaneous activities. \n \n “We were surprised to find that talking and texting on a cell phone were so disruptive to one’s gait and memory recall,” said Eric M. Lamberg, co-author of the study and clinical associate professor in the Department of Physical Therapy at Stony Brook University’s School of Health Technology and Management. \n \n The study, by Lamberg and Lisa M. Muratori, a clinical associate professor in Stony Brook’s Department of Physical Therapy, was published in Gait & Posture titled “Cell phones change the way we walk.” \n \n “We were looking at whether texting had more disruptions than talking on a cell phone,” Lamberg said. \n \n Researchers asked participants to walk to a point 8 feet away and then asked them to return and repeat the exercise while texting, as well as talking on cell phones. \n \n The researchers found “gait velocity is reduced when using a cell phone while talking or texting,” that “navigational errors occur when texting while walking” and “texting while walking produces greater interference than talking on a cell phone.” \n \n “Cell phone use among pedestrians leads to increased cognitive distraction, reduced situation awareness and increases in unsafe behavior,” according to the abstract of the study in Gait and Posture online. “Performing a dual-task, such as talking or texting with a cell phone while walking, may interfere with working memory and result in walking errors.” \n \n Participants who texted while walking “veered off course, demonstrating a 61 percent increase in lateral deviation and 13 percent increase in distance traveled.” \n \n Lamberg said this shows the impact such distractions have on walking, an activity that seems automatic. \n \n “We are using the findings to help physical therapy patients improve true functional walking,” he said, noting some tasks may affect their gait or certain aspects of memory. “In rehabilitation, we should use this as a tool to prepare our patients to be more ready to function in a natural environment.” \n \n He said patients going through rehabilitation might even be told to text or talk while walking as they seek to regain their stride. \n \n “We think using dual-task methodology is a way to challenge people during rehabilitation,” Lamberg said, noting, at a minimum, people might be prepared for this dual tasking. “Using cell phone use as part of a gait-training paradigm isn’t common in physical therapy.” \n \n Reports surfaced last year that Philadelphia banned texting while walking, although city officials quashed those rumors. \n \n And texting while walking causes a fair number of collisions, although not like those while driving. \n \n While she was texting while walking last summer in the Berkshire Mall in Reading, Pa., Cathy Cruz Marrero tumbled into the mall fountain. \n \n The video system at the mall, where she worked, captured that moment. The video was posted on YouTube, generating nearly 4 million views. \n \n “We want to raise awareness that a real disruption occurs because of texting,” Lamberg said of the bigger picture. “Texting disrupts your ability much more than does talking.” \n \n Should texting while walking be banned? That’s not the idea behind the research. \n \n “Absolutely not,” Lamberg said. “I think it’s just to raise an awareness to this issue, that it does disrupt your ability to walk naturally.” \n \n More breaking news']",2,"– Monday was Bitcoin Pizza Day, the anniversary of the day in 2010 when developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas in the online currency's first recognized transaction.

179,"['(CNN) A federal criminal investigation into a deadly duck boat sinking on a Missouri lake was initiated after the US Coast Guard determined the 17 deaths resulted from ""misconduct, negligence or inattention to the duties"" by the captain of the duck boat, according to a court document filed Wednesday. \n \n The new investigation also is looking at another duck boat captain and officials at the company that operates the tourist ride, the court document says. \n \n There are several investigations into the July 19 incident, including the state of Missouri, which is also looking into criminal liability, and the National Transportation Safety Board, which is trying to determine what caused the sinking. \n \n Survivors of some of the people who died are, in four cases, suing Ripley Entertainment, which runs the duck boat tours called Ride the Ducks Branson. \n \n On Wednesday, the US government attached a motion to the civil cases, asking that a court rule that federal investigators be allowed first to talk to the pertinent witnesses and participants in the case. \n \n Read More', 'The captains of two Ride the Ducks boats that battled rough waters before one sank last month are targets of a criminal investigation, according to federal court documents filed Wednesday. \n \n Kenneth Scott McKee, captain of the sunken Stretch Duck 07, and Barry King, captain of Stretch Duck 54, “are aware of their status as targets of the Government action,” the document says. They are under investigation for allegedly operating the vessel in a manner that endangered lives. \n \n Seventeen of the 31 passengers on Duck 07 died when the boat sank in Table Rock Lake near Branson on July 19. Duck 54 was also on the water but made it to shore. \n \n The documents filed in U.S. District Court Wednesday also indicate that Ripley Entertainment, which owns the duck boats, is another “target” or “subject” of the investigation. And they say that “several Ripley agents, employees, or officers have been identified as targets and/or subjects of the Government action.” \n \n Digital Access For Only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. \n \n The U.S. Attorneys’ manual defines a “target” as “a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant.” A “subject” of an investigation, the manual says, “is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury’s investigation.” \n \n King’s wife turned to social media after the sinking that night to tell Facebook friends her husband was OK. She wrote that he was also on the lake that night, at the same time, and faced rough weather. \n \n “He said he rode 4 ft waves and prayed,” she said. “He and his passengers rode on angels wings to safety. Our heart aches for the Captain and passengers of the Duck that capsized.” \n \n One woman responded: “So thankful Barry was guided to safety! Definitely on angels wings! Prayers for all.” \n \n The Star repeatedly has attempted to talk with both captains. Those attempts have been unsuccessful. \n \n SHARE COPY LINK Three members of a family describe the duck boat tragedy as seen from the Showboat Branson Belle on Thursday at Table Rock Lake near Branson. \n \n Cellphone video taken from the nearby Showboat Branson Belle, which was docked at the time of the storm, captured the two boats as they struggled in the lake. A viral video of the incident ended right before McKee’s boat went under. He was among the 14 survivors. \n \n The first 911 call about Stretch Duck 07 came at 7:09 p.m., 14 minutes after the boat entered the water that night. \n \n The National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 6:32 p.m., specifically naming Table Rock Lake. The warning said winds in excess of 60 mph were possible. In reality, winds on the lake reached 73 mph with waves of more than 3 feet. \n \n According to a recent report by the National Transportation Safety Board, the captain and driver were on board at 6:28 that evening when someone stepped onto the back of the boat and told the crew to take the water portion of the tour first. It isn’t known who that person is. The driver, whose job is to steer the duck boat on land, died in the sinking. \n \n The U.S. Coast Guard referred the investigation to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri on Aug. 13 to pursue possible federal criminal charges. That office, based in Kansas City, includes the Table Rock Lake area. \n \n According to the document filed Wednesday, the Coast Guard notified the U.S. Attorney’s Office that its preliminary probable cause determination was that the sinking of Stretch Duck 07 and the loss of lives “resulted from the misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain of the vessel at the time of the sinking, which is a violation of federal criminal law.” \n \n The certificate of inspection for Stretch Duck 07 set stringent guidelines for wind and water conditions. It states that the “vessel shall not be operated waterborne when winds exceed 35 mph, and/or the wave height exceeds two feet.” \n \n The Coast Guard also notified the U.S. Attorney’s Office of its preliminary probable cause determination “that the operation of Stretch Duck 54 on July 19, 2018, was undertaken by the captain of that vessel in a grossly negligent manner that interfered with the safe operation of the vessel and endangered the lives or bodies of persons on board the vessel.” \n \n The federal investigation is being conducted in addition to a separate criminal probe by the Missouri attorney general. \n \n Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley’s office confirmed to The Star on July 30 that it had opened a criminal investigation to explore the possibility of violations of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. \n \n The act forbids fraud and deception in the sale of goods and services. \n \n Several lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts, three on behalf of passengers who died and one on behalf of a survivor.

Jennifer Asher alleges that Ripley Entertainment “took the lives of seventeen people when it made the conscious decision to disregard the known dangers of its vehicles in volatile weather and instructed its employees to begin their excursion on the water.” \n \n Wednesday’s filing asked the court to put a hold on the discovery process for all lawsuits until the criminal investigation is complete. Prosecutors say the action is necessary to prevent civil lawsuits from interfering with a federal probe. \n \n Ripley spokeswoman Suzanne Smagala-Potts said last week that the company was cooperating fully with federal and state authorities. \n \n “We are providing all documentation and materials requested in the case,” she said in an email to The Star. “However, as a party to the ongoing NTSB investigation, we are refrained from commenting to the media on the matters being investigated.” \n \n The court documents filed Wednesday, however, cite a federal law regarding negligence or misconduct when operating a vessel. \n \n According to that law: “Every captain, engineer, pilot, or other person employed on any steamboat or vessel, by whose misconduct, negligence, or inattention to his duties on such vessel the life of any person is destroyed ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.”']",2,"– The duck boat sinking that killed 17 on a Missouri lake is now the subject of a federal criminal investigation after the Coast Guard found probable cause for negligence. The US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri is seeking to delay civil lawsuits over the July 19 incident until the end of its ""wide-ranging"" investigation to prevent revealing evidence too early, though two boat captains already know themselves to be targets. Per the Springfield News-Leader, the Coast Guard found probable cause for ""misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain"" by Kenneth McKee of Ride the Ducks Branson's sunken Stretch Duck 07, and also probable cause that Barry King acted in a ""grossly negligent manner"" while operating Stretch Duck 54, which made it to safety. The Branson area had been under a severe thunderstorm warning for 20 minutes before Stretch Duck 07 entered Table Rock Lake, where 73mph winds whipped up waves more than three feet high. Per the Wichita Eagle, the boat wasn't to be operated in winds exceeding 35mph or waves exceeding two feet. Civil cases also accuse Ride the Ducks Branson, owned by Ripley Entertainment, of putting passengers at risk through use of boat canopies, citing a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation to remove them following a 1999 tragedy. The NTSB is also investigating this case, along with the state, per CNN. ""We continue to fully cooperate,"" Ripley says in a statement, adding ""we are providing all documentation and materials requested in the case."""

(Associated Press) \n \n About 70 staff members at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital were involved in the care of Thomas Eric Duncan after he was hospitalized, including a nurse now being treated for the same Ebola virus that killed the Liberian man who was visiting Dallas, according to medical records his family provided to The Associated Press. \n \n The size of the medical team reflects the hospital\'s intense effort to save Duncan\'s life, but it also suggests that many other people could have been exposed to the virus during Duncan\'s time in an isolation unit. \n \n On Monday, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the infection of the nurse means the agency must broaden the pool of people getting close monitoring. Authorities have said they do not know how 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham was infected, but they suspect some kind of breach in the hospital\'s protocol. \n \n The medical records given to the AP offer clues, both to what happened and who was involved, but the hospital said the CDC does not have them. \n \n A CDC spokeswoman said the agency reviewed the medical records with Duncan\'s care team and concluded that the documents were not helpful in identifying those who interacted directly with the patient. \n \n ""This is not something we can afford to experiment with. We need to get this right,"" said Ruth McDermott-Levy, who directs the Center for Global and Public Health in Villanova University\'s College of Nursing. \n \n Until now, the CDC has been actively monitoring 48 people who might have had contact with Duncan after he fell ill with an infection but before he was put in isolation. The number included 10 people known to have contact and 38 who may have had contact, including people he was staying with and health care professionals who attended to him during an emergency room visit from which he was sent home. None is sick. \n \n The CDC has not yet established a firm number of health care workers who had contact with Duncan. \n \n ""If this one individual was infected — and we don\'t know how — within the isolation unit, then it is possible that other individuals could have been infected as well,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC. ""We do not today have a number of such exposed people or potentially exposed health care workers. It\'s a relatively large number, we think in the end."" \n \n Caregivers who began treating Duncan after he tested positive for Ebola were following a ""self-monitoring regimen"" in which they were instructed to take their temperatures regularly and report any symptoms. But they were not considered at high risk. Pham went to the hospital Friday night after she took her temperature and found she had a fever. \n \n Typically, the nurses, doctors and technicians caring for a contagious patient in isolation would be treating other people as well, and going home to their families after decontaminating themselves. The hospital has refused to answer questions about their specific duties. \n \n The 1,400-plus pages of medical records show that nurses, doctors and other hospital employees wore face shields, double gowns, protective footwear and even hazmat suits to avoid touching any of Duncan\'s bodily fluids. Ebola spreads through direct contact with those fluids, usually blood, feces and vomit. The virus has also been detected in urine, semen and breast milk, and it may be in saliva and tears. \n \n CDC officials said there were chinks in that protection at Texas Presbyterian, but they have not identified them and are investigating. \n \n ""Patient had large, extremely watery diarrhea,"" a nurse wrote in a report filed the day Duncan tested positive. \n \n Another nurse noted that Duncan\'s urine was ""darker in color with noted blood streaks."" \n \n It was unclear from the records released to the AP how many of the approximately 70 individuals involved in Duncan\'s care had direct contact with his body or fluids. \n \n Dr. Aileen Marty, a World Health Organization doctor who recently returned to Florida International University after a month fighting Ebola in Nigeria, said no amount of protection is going to help if hospital workers do not put on and take off their protective layers carefully. \n \n ""The first thing in caring for someone with Ebola is to do everything in your power to never become a victim,"" she said. \n \n And tracking all contacts, even within the medical setting, is complicated. \n \n Generally, the first step in locating care providers for isolated infected patients is a personnel log on the door, ""that should have everyone going in and out, signing in and out,"" said Dr. Lisa Esolen, Geisinger Health System\'s Medical Director of Health Services and Infection Prevention and Control. Medical records indicate the Dallas hospital had a log. \n \n On the day before Duncan died, records indicate that at least nine caregivers entered and exited the room. \n \n A spokesman for Texas Health Resources, the hospital\'s parent company, said the CDC probably has a log from the room door that would list everyone who got close to Duncan. \n \n Dr. Christopher Ohl, who heads Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center\'s infectious-disease department and has worked with the CDC in the past, said the expanding monitoring ""is an abundance of caution that\'s probably beyond what needs to be done"" because medical caregivers will notice if they\'re getting a fever, and they\'re not contagious until that point. \n \n ""You start to know when you get those body aches and headaches, most people know that,"" he said.

Most people can figure out what to do when that happens."" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Maud Beelman and Jamie Stengle contributed to this report.', ""The 33-year-old freelance cameraman who contracted Ebola in Liberia is fighting for his life at the University of Nebraska Medical Center this week.

181,"['Resources Thank the PFMC for Protecting the West Coast Ecosystem \n \n The Pacific coast of North America supports one of the most vibrant and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth, largely because of the presence of thick schools of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that depend on sardines as a major food source. In addition, because sardines have been a staple of commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast, their decline raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. \n \n \n \n The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, should do two things to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean: \n \n Set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low. \n \n Fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. \n \n \n \n Cause for concern \n \n Populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. That’s because forage fish are highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient- rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. \n \n The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck’s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. \n \n \n \n Keeping an eye on the big picture \n \n Forage fish account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish rather than being directly eaten by people. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 2012, the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists from around the world, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water—about $11.3 billion—as they are when caught because of their value as food for commercially important predators. \n \n For further information, please visit: pewenvironment.org/pacificfish \n \n \n \n Write the Pacific Fishery Management Council at: pfmc.comments@noaa.gov', 'The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. \n \n ""Tonight\'s pretty reflective of how things have been going,"" Hanson said. ""Not very well."" \n \n To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. \n \n If sardines don\'t recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast\'s marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. \n \n The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. \n \n One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. \n \n If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. \n \n An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006. Spawning has taken a dive too. \n \n In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright. \n \n ""We shouldn\'t be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,"" said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. \n \n The Pacific sardine is the ocean\'s quintessential boom-bust fish. It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools. \n \n It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California\'s sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world\'s top fishing ports. \n \n And then it collapsed. \n \n By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years. The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday. \n \n Since the 1940s scientists have debated how much of the collapse was caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. Now, researchers are posing the same question. \n \n ""It\'s a terribly difficult scientific problem,"" said Russ Vetter, director of the Fisheries Resources Division at NOAA\'s Southwest Fisheries Science Center. \n \n Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile fluctuate in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle but have been more heavily exploited, Vetter said. West Coast sardines are considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, a practice that could explain why their latest rebound lasted as long as it did. The West Coast\'s last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. \n \n In recent years scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines\' value as ""forage fish,"" small but nutrition-packed species such as herring and market squid that form the core of the ocean food web, funneling energy upward by eating tiny plankton and being preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales. \n \n Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. \n \n Melin\'s research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.']",2,"– The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."

Our source says at least two agents had escorts check into their rooms. It is unclear whether the escorts who returned to the hotels were some of the strippers from the same club. \n \n These alleged incidents in El Salvador occurred a full year prior to recent revelations that secret service agents used prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, on a presidential trip this month. \n \n To further confirm information provided about behaviors in El Salvador that reportedly occurred in March of 2011, Halsne interviewed the owner of the San Salvador strip club in which the subcontractor said they visited. The strip club’s owner confirmed a large number of U.S. secret service agents (and some military escorts) “descended on his club” that week prior to President Obama’s visit. He claims agents were there at least three nights in a row. ""No surprise to me."" The owner told Halsne his club routinely takes care of high-ranking employees of the U.S. embassy in San Salvador as well as visiting FBI and DEA agents.

He told Halsne during a lengthy interview, he doesn’t allow prostitution inside the club and that all his ""girls"" are at least 18-years-old. He says the girls can do what they want after work, but he discourages them from making contact with customers at other locations. \n \n This investigation is still fast-developing. Halsne has names of some of the agents allegedly involved in the partying and has viewed records which add credibility to the subcontractor’s eyewitness testimony.

Lagos said the request wasn\'t a delaying tactic but an attempt by Phillips to make a final gesture for good. \n \n The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction had denied Phillips\' request earlier this week, citing logistics and security concerns, according to the AP. \n \n The DRC isn\'t aware of any other time that an Ohio death-row inmate has made an organ donation, according to spokeswoman JoEllen Smith. However, Smith noted that it has happened in other states such as California. \n \n In a statement, Kasich said he realized the situation ""is a bit of uncharted territory"" for Ohio. \n \n ""But if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues, then we should allow for that to happen,"" he said. \n \n Under DRC policy, state prison officials will conduct the initial compatibility tests. \n \n If a transplant of any non-vital organs is feasible, Phillips would undergo an operation at Ohio State University Medical Center before returning to death row, the governor\'s office said in a release. His execution has been rescheduled for July 2, 2014 at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. \n \n Phillips\' execution has drawn increased attention because he was scheduled to be the first person put to death in Ohio using a new and untried lethal-injection cocktail consisting of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a morphine derivative. \n \n The new method was announced last month because of a shortage of pentobarbital caused by European manufacturers\' reluctance to sell the drug for executions. \n \n With Phillips\' execution postponed, Dennis McGuire may become the first inmate put to death using the new cocktail. McGuire, a Preble County man convicted of raping, choking and stabbing a pregnant woman in 1989, is scheduled to die Jan. 16, 2014. \n \n Under the DRC\'s new protocol, the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility warden must notify department Director Gary Mohr within 14 days of McGuire\'s execution date whether he has enough pentobarbital to carry out the execution or if the new cocktail must be employed instead.', 'Convicted child-killer Ronald Phillips was in the Death House and had ordered his last meal when he got the word yesterday: Gov. John Kasich had postponed his execution set for today to determine whether his “nonvital” organs could be harvested as he requested. \n \n His execution now is scheduled for July 2. \n \n “His first words were, ‘God is good.’ He feels immense gratitude to the governor,” said Tim Sweeney, the condemned man’s Cleveland attorney. \n \n Kasich’s action is unprecedented in the nation in the case of an imminent execution, a death-penalty expert said. \n \n The Republican governor said he halted Phillips’ execution “so that medical experts can assess whether Phillips’ nonvital organs or tissues can be donated to his mother or possibly others.” \n \n “Ronald Phillips committed a heinous crime for which he will face the death penalty,” Kasich said in a statement less than 18 hours before the condemned man was to be lethally injected using two drugs never before used in combination. “I realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues, then we should allow for that to happen.” \n \n The governor said if Phillips “is found to be a viable donor to his mother or possibly others awaiting transplants of nonvital organs, such as kidneys, the procedures would be performed and then he would be returned to Death Row to await his new execution date.” \n \n There was no immediate comment from Akron Prosecutor Sherry Bevan Walsh, who handled the case. \n \n Phillips, 40, was to be executed at 10 a.m. today at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility near Lucasville for the 1993 beating, rape and murder of 3-year-old Sheila Marie Evans, the daughter of his girlfriend at the time. He had exhausted all legal appeals and was moved yesterday to the Lucasville prison, where executions take place. Last night, he was returned to Death Row at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. \n \n Sweeney said his client was motivated “by love for his mom and for the desire to do something good. He’s been very remorseful for what he did, thoughtful and reflective over the past couple weeks.” \n \n He wants to donate a kidney to his mother, who is on dialysis treatment for kidney disease, but is willing to donate to others if that is not possible. \n \n Sweeney said he wasn’t sure what Phillips can donate, but he said it might include his kidneys, lungs, liver or bone marrow. \n \n Prisons policy requires that the cost of transplant surgery be paid by Phillips or the organ recipients, not by Ohio taxpayers, spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said. The policy also requires that Phillips’ surgery be performed at the Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University. \n \n It is the first time in the United States that an execution was stopped to permit an inmate’s organs to be harvested, said Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C. He said a Delaware inmate, Steven Shelton, was allowed to donate his kidney in 2005, but he was not facing immediate execution. \n \n Phillips had ordered, but did not have time to eat, his “last meal,” which included pizza with mushrooms, onions and double cheese, spaghetti, corn chips, Dr Pepper, rocky road ice cream and Oreo cheese cake. \n \n ajohnson@dispatch.com \n \n @ohioaj']",2,"– A convicted child killer just got a last-minute reprieve from Ohio's governor, thanks to the inmate's unusual request to be an organ donor. Ronald Phillips, who raped and murdered the 3-year-old daughter of his girlfriend, was supposed to be put to death tomorrow morning. Instead, Gov. John Kasich has postponed the execution until July while the state considers Phillips' plea to donate organs to family members or anyone else who might need them, reports the Columbus Dispatch. ""I realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen,” said Kasich. If doctors think Phillips' non-vital organs can be harvested, he would undergo surgery before his execution, reports the Cleveland Plain Dealer. This isn't the only reason Phillips' case is making headlines—prison officials plan to use an untested combination of drugs because of a shortage of the standard pentobarbital."

He appeared to be referring to text messages the Justice Department provided Congress this week in which a senior agent described candidate Trump as an ""idiot"" and made other political remarks in the course of the presidential campaign. \n \n Trump\'s comments are the latest in a barrage of criticism he has directed at the FBI. Earlier this month, he declared on Twitter that the bureau\'s reputation is ""in Tatters — worst in History!"" \n \n That assessment came days after special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia investigation, secured a guilty plea from Trump\'s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. \n \n Trump opened the door Friday to pardoning Flynn. \n \n ""I don\'t want to talk about pardons with Michael Flynn — yet,"" Trump said. ""We\'ll see what happens. Let\'s see."" \n \n Flynn has not been sentenced and appears to be a cooperating witness as part of Mueller\'s Russia probe. Trump called the investigation a ""Democrat hoax,"" ""an excuse for losing the election"" and claimed again ""there is absolutely no collusion."" \n \n toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images \n \n Later, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said, ""There is no consideration at the White House of a pardon for Michael Flynn."" \n \n Trump\'s remarks on his way to Quantico, Va., carried new potency given the president\'s audience Friday morning: the latest graduating class at the FBI\'s National Academy for law enforcement managers. \n \n In his speech, the president refrained from attacking the FBI. He made only passing references to the bureau in his remarks before U.S. and international law enforcement officers who were graduating from a program at the FBI\'s prestigious training center. \n \n Instead, Trump\'s speech focused on his ""law and order"" agenda, and he echoed comments Attorney General Jeff Sessions has frequently made since Inauguration Day: The administration backs the police. \n \n ""With me as your president, America\'s police will have a true friend and loyal champion in the White House. More loyal that anyone else can be,"" Trump said. ""You very rarely get the recognition you deserve."" \n \n He promised to work with law enforcement to crack down on drug cartels and gangs, such as MS-13, whose members he referred to as ""savages."" \n \n ""We\'ll get rid of them completely, very soon, right?"" Trump said as he turned and pointed to Sessions. ""To any member of MS-13 listening: We will find you; we will arrest you; we will jail you; we will throw you the hell out of the country."" \n \n While Trump refrained from criticizing the FBI in his speech, his comments earlier in the day hung over his appearance in Quantico — and dominated TV news coverage leading up to his address. \n \n That is because it\'s unusual for a president to blast the bureau — the premier law enforcement agency in the country. \n \n In fact, over the past 15 years, it has been the other way around. President Barack Obama famously visited bureau headquarters a few months after he took office in 2009, donning an FBI baseball cap and sharing ""the thanks of a grateful nation."" A year earlier, President George W. Bush praised ""the character and courage of those who carry the badge."" \n \n The appearance at the FBI had already promised to be complicated for Trump, given his record of derogatory public statements and negative tweets about the FBI this year. \n \n Recently, Trump tweeted that the FBI\'s reputation was in ""Tatters - worst in History!"" He called popular former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired in May, ""a liar"" and ""a leaker."" Trump also accused the FBI, without providing any evidence, of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower in 2016. And he continues to cast doubt on a conclusion by the bureau and other intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in last year\'s presidential election. \n \n On Friday morning, Trump reaffirmed to reporters, ""there is absolutely no collusion. I didn\'t make a phone call to Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. Everybody knows it. That was a Democrat hoax. It was an excuse for losing the election."" \n \n Another source of awkwardness: the FBI\'s longtime former leader, Mueller, is the man running the ongoing special counsel probe into election interference — and into whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign took part. So far, Mueller\'s team has secured indictments against Paul Manafort, Trump\'s onetime campaign chairman, and won guilty pleas from a campaign foreign policy official and Flynn. \n \n That last development, on Dec. 1, prompted a new wave of attacks from Trump and his supporters on the integrity of the FBI and the Justice Department, fueled by the disclosure that the Justice Department Inspector General had uncovered text messages in which a senior agent working on the Russia probe had called Trump an ""idiot"" during the campaign. \n \n While Mueller removed the agent from the investigation months ago, one of Trump\'s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, has cited the matter to call for a second special counsel to investigate conflicts of interest at the bureau. \n \n In response to a stream of harsh criticism this month, the FBI Agents Association mounted a rare public defense. \n \n ""Every day, FBI special agents put their lives on the line to protect the American public from national security and criminal threats,"" President Tom O\'Connor tweeted. ""Agents perform their duties with unwavering integrity and professionalism and a focus on complying with the law and the Constitution. This is why the FBI continues to be the premier law enforcement agency in the world."" \n \n Trump\'s pick to lead the FBI, former Justice Department official Christopher Wray, also raised his voice to defend the workforce in congressional testimony last week. \n \n ""Let me start by saying that it is for me the honor of a lifetime to be here representing the men and women of the FBI,"" Wray said. ""There is no finer institution than the FBI and no finer people than the men and women who work there and are its very beating heart."" \n \n Trump appeared on stage with Wray to welcome the new class of National Academy graduates at what is known as the agency\'s ""police training center."" \n \n The program puts attendees through a series of academic and physical challenges, building partnerships between police and the FBI. Nearly 10 years ago, Mueller told an FBI graduating class at Quantico, ""For the past 100 years, the FBI has stood for the best of America."" \n \n It remains to be seen whether the new president agrees.', 'President Donald Trump gestures to the crowd at the FBI National Academy graduation ceremony, Friday, Dec. 15, 2017, in Quantico, Va.

Gidley says Trump maintains confidence in the FBI\'s rank-and-file. \n \n Edits to the Comey draft appeared to soften the gravity of the bureau\'s finding in its 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton\'s use of a private email server while secretary of state. \n \n ""It is very sad when you look at those documents, how they\'ve done that is really, really disgraceful, and you have a lot of really angry people who are seeing it,"" Trump said of the document. \n \n Gidley said the disclosure of politically charged text messages sent by one of the agents on the Clinton case, Peter Strzok, were ""eye-opening.""

He was re-assigned after the messages were uncovered this summer. \n \n About 200 leaders in law enforcement from around the country attended the weeks-long FBI National Academy program aimed at raising law enforcement standards and cooperation.

185,"['Many news organizations will make election integrity issues a central part of their coverage plans, especially given accusations by the U.S. government of Russian cyber espionage and Donald Trump’s evidence-less allegations of vote tampering and rigging. | AP Photo Media launches joint war-room to spot voting problems To covering 2016’s voting obstacles and hoaxes, press tries sharing tips, sources and data across typically competing newsrooms. \n \n After spending 2016 trying to outmaneuver each other and deliver the next big break, hundreds of newsrooms are now engaged in unprecedented reporting partnerships to uncover barriers to voting and debunk fake news that can cause chaos and confusion on Election Day. \n \n The biggest of the new alliances is Electionland, a project involving more than 400 newsrooms across the country casting aside competitiveness to share real-time data and tips on everything from reports about long lines and voter intimidation to hoax tweets suggesting stuffed ballot boxes. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n New York-based journalism non-profit ProPublica created the free service earlier this year by partnering up with national desks at USA Today and The New York Times, as well as scores of local news organizations including the Arizona Republic, Miami Herald and the Virginian-Pilot. Participating reporters and editors are all connected to an online smorgasbord of story leads and sources culled from social media, text messages and a national telephone helpline that the public is using to report voting problems. \n \n “It’s an entire national newsroom, essentially only looking at problems facing people who vote,” said Jessica Huseman, a ProPublica senior reporting fellow. \n \n While the Associated Press and CNN were among the major media outlets that declined invitations to join Electionland, it was a no-brainer for many local outlets crushed in recent years by layoffs and budget cuts. After all, what they’re getting is no-strings-attached data, technology and information that can go a long way to covering one of most challenging days of a journalist’s year. \n \n “Any help a newsroom can get to sift through some of this stuff, to get to the more useful stuff, is absolutely valuable,” said Matt Dempsey, a Houston Chronicle data reporter leading his office’s coordination with Electionland. \n \n Last week, Dempsey’s team published a front-page story based off multiple Electionland tips that led them to find poll workers in Harris County, Texas, giving voters incomplete instructions about photo identification. Other recent stories tied to Electionland’s analysis during the early voting period include Donald Trump supporters using a bullhorn outside the polls in West Palm Beach, Fla., and debunking a pair of internet hoaxes: one purporting to show video of Democrats stuffing ballot boxes and the other co-published with Univision that appears to show an immigration officer arresting someone waiting in line to vote. \n \n Much of the dot-connecting is emanating from Electionland’s national desk based out of a pop-up newsroom at the City University of New York. There are also regional teams stationed at 14 journalism schools around the country, where students will be mining social media through keyword searches in multiple languages, looking out for local, regional and national trends about long lines, provisional ballot shortages, overly aggressive poll watchers and other forms of voter intimidation. Students have been trained to identify legitimate Twitter accounts, and they’re getting on-site help from professional reporters dispatched by ProPublica, the USA Today and The New York Times to package up relevant information for sharing – jump-ball style – to their media partners for follow-up reporting. \n \n Electionland is also tapping into data generated by the national 866-OUR-VOTE telephone hotline that’s been taking calls on everything from malfunctioning election equipment to voter ID and intimidation problems. “They’re seeing the meat and potatoes of complaints,” said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has been running its phone-reporting program since 2002. \n \n USA Today’s editors said in an interview that they expect Electionland will be a useful tool for their network of regional reporters at 25 sister newspapers across the country. They anticipate some of the leads will be false starts, and in some instances they’ll need to skip a tip because of staffing constraints, picking up on it later if it pans out through aggregation from other news sources. \n \n But they said the project had plenty of relevance in a high-stakes election ripe with voting challenges, and where memories remain strong of the 2000 debacle when Florida’s hanging chads led to a prolonged legal dispute over recounts that lasted more than a month before George W. Bush was declared the president-elect. \n \n “This is a really interesting experiment,” said Lee Horwich, managing editor for USA Today’s politics team. “I don’t know exactly how it’s going to work. I don’t think any of us do. It seems like the right thing to do.” \n \n The most useful stories of national interest will be highlighted on Electionland’s blog, and local partners are urged to tout their network on social media when they publish something inspired by a tip. Several of the members described the project as historic for the journalism industry given the collaboration across so many different newsrooms and despite the press’s inherent nature to fight over exclusives. \n \n “The competitiveness of this is harder and harder to measure since everybody publishes everything they can confirm on Twitter, on Facebook, on whatever social platform you care to mention,” Horwich said. “The competitive advantage of being out 10 seconds, 3 minutes before others is not my top priority that day. My top priority is to get as complete a report and as accurate report as we possibly can.” \n \n Journalists turning to a collaborative approach are doing so at the end of a 2016 presidential campaign unlike any other in modern times. Entire news organizations including the Washington Post, Buzzfeed and POLITICO have been banned at various times from attending Trump events, though those restrictions were later lifted. Crowds at the Republican’s rallies routinely boo and jeer at mainstream media outlets and the candidate’s traveling press corps. Fact checking has become a ubiquitous part of campaign coverage, while fake news articles maintain long shelf lives despite repeated attempts to debunk them and pledges by Facebook and Twitter to implement policies to address the issue. Meanwhile, the public’s trust in the media has hit its lowest level since Gallup polling on the topic started in 1972. \n \n Against that backdrop, many news organizations will make election integrity issues a central part of their coverage plans, especially given accusations by the U.S. government of Russian cyber espionage and Trump’s evidence-less allegations of vote tampering and rigging. \n \n At the networks, CBS has assigned its justice beat reporter to cover cyber and election hacking concerns on Election Day. Four NBC reporters will be on air covering voting irregularities, and it has a dedicated blog on the issue written by the author of a book on voter suppression. \n \n “It’s going to be a shit show,” warned Brooke Binkowski, managing editor at Snopes, which is deploying about two dozen reporters and researchers for fact checking on internet hoaxes and other voting problems surrounding Election Day. \n \n Another new startup aimed at helping the press and public to sift through the noise of Election Day is Votecastr, a partnership between data scientists, journalists and tech investors that plans to publish detailed projections Tuesday based off real-time turnout figures, combined with pre-polling surveys on voting preferences. The project will be pulling information from about 700 precincts in eight key battleground states -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania – and publishing on Slate. A live video steam of the analysis will be available on Vice Media. \n \n Sasha Issenberg, one of the founding partners of the project, said the information can be useful to journalists looking for real-time evidence of polling problems. They would see signs if turnout levels are down at a precinct, which could suggest anything from broken voting machines to shortages on provisional ballots or intimidation. \n \n “I hope that we are a generator of leads and hypotheses for reporters to chase,” he said. \n \n While journalists may be encouraging the cross-newsroom partnerships and data and source sharing, they are also exposing themselves to heightened scrutiny from critics in Trump’s camp who may interpret their work as another example of the press trying to sabotage the Republican’s campaign. \n \n “People will think even more what they always thought: the press is in collusion. We’re all one big group think. I think that can go either way depending on who you are talking to,” said Jane Elizabeth, a senior manager of the American Press Institute’s accountability journalism project. \n \n “I’d hate to be in the middle of an election where this type of fact checking isn’t taking place,” she added. “You don’t know how much it’s going to help. But you don’t want to see the reverse side of that either.”', 'In a historic ruling that provided a huge morale boost to the gay-rights movement, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman Friday struck down Michigan�s ban on same-sex marriage, making it the 18th state in the nation to allow gays and lesbians to join in matrimony, just like their heterosexual counterparts. \n \n Just hours later, Washtenaw, Muskegon and Oakland counties announced they�ll open their clerk�s offices to issue marriage licenses on Saturday. \n \n �Many Michigan residents have religious convictions whose principles govern the conduct of their daily lives and inform their own viewpoints about marriage,� Friedman wrote in his 31-page ruling. �Nonetheless, these views cannot strip other citizens of the guarantees of equal protection under the law.� \n \n ■ PDF: Read the judge�s ruling on gay marriage \n \n ■ Related: Questions, answers on today�s ruling \n \n Friedman, who declared Michigan�s ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, went a step further than other judges across the country who have made similar decisions. \n \n Friedman did not stay his ruling. \n \n That prompted Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette to file an emergency stay request to prevent gay couples from marrying right away. That includes the two plaintiffs in the case: Hazel Park nurses April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, who fought for the right to marry and adopt each other�s special needs children. \n \n �It�s just amazing,� said DeBoer, who wiped tears and hugged her partner after learning of Friedman�s ruling. �This is what we�ve wanted for our family and families like ours �we are just so happy ... We got our day in court and we won.� \n \n Rowse was overwhelmed. \n \n �We�re going to actually be a legalized family, a recognized family by everybody,� she said. \n \n In his 31-page ruling, Friedman heavily criticized the state�s position that the will of the voters should have been upheld, noting that just because voters approve something doesn�t make it right, especially when it violates the Constitution. \n \n �In attempting to define this case as a challenge to �the will of the people,� state defendants lost sight of what this case is truly about: people. \n \n �No court record of this proceeding could ever fully convey the personal sacrifice of these two plaintiffs who seek to ensure that the state may no longer impair the rights of their children and the thousands of others now being raised by same-sex couples,� Friedman wrote. \n \n �It is the court�s fervent hope that these children will grow up to �understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.� \n \n �Today�s decision is a step in that direction, and affirms the enduring principle that regardless of whoever finds favor in the eyes of the most recent majority, the guarantee of equal protection must prevail.� \n \n Schuette, meanwhile, vowed to continue to fight to uphold the Michigan Marriage Amendment Act, which 2.7 million voters approved in 2004 when they decided that marriage can only be defined as a union between a man and a woman. \n \n �In 2004, the citizens of Michigan recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable. Michigan voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution, and their will should stand and be respected,� Schuette said following today�s ruling. \n \n Schuette said he expects the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals will grant his request for a stay, noting the U.S. Supreme Court intervened in Utah�s gay-marriage case and granted that state�s request for a stay. \n \n The state has long argued that the will of the voters should not be drowned out by a single judge. The state also argues that it has a �legitimate� interest in preserving the traditional family structure because � it claims � children thrive best when raised by married moms and dads. \n \n Friedman, though, sided with the plaintiffs. \n \n For DeBoer and Rowse, the case did not start out about marriage rights but about adoption rights. The two women want to adopt each others�s children � two preschool-age boys and a 4-year-old girl � but can�t because Michigan doesn�t allow same-sex couple adoptions. \n \n Now, if Friedman�s ruling stands, they can get married and adopt each other�s children. \n \n Unlike most federal judges who have taken up the gay-marriage issue, Friedman opted last fall to hold a trial and give both sides the chance to present their arguments and scientific evidence. \n \n The state�s experts said that their studies show that children of same-sex couples have poorer outcomes than kids raised by married moms and dads. \n \n Friedman didn�t find the state�s experts credible, stating in his ruling that the testimony of one state witness was �entirely unbelievable and not worthy of serious consideration.� He said the state�s four witnesses �clearly represent a fringe viewpoint that is rejected by the vast majority of their colleagues across a variety of social science fields.� \n \n Friedman, however, said he did find the plaintiffs� experts to be credible. They said their research showed that there were no real differences in the outcomes of children raised by same-sex couples compared with those raised by moms and dads. \n \n The plaintiffs also argued that child outcomes should have nothing to do with the marriage issue anyway, because having kids isn�t a prerequisite for getting married. \n \n Friedman agreed. \n \n Meanwhile, legal experts believe the gay-marriage debate ultimately will be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has not yet issued a definitive ruling on same-sex marriage. \n \n Dana Nessel, one of the lawyers for DeBoer and Rowse, said the patchwork of legislation involving same-sex marriage has led to chaos, specifically for same-sex couples who are legally recognized in one state but then move to another and have no legal recognition. It�s especially problematic come tax time, she said, noting same-sex couples, depending on where they live, have to file separately because their marriage isn�t recognized. \n \n �This has to be resolved,� Nessel said. �This can�t continue. You can�t have this patchwork system anymore.�']",2,"– If misery and politics make strange bedfellows, their Election 2016 love child in the Fourth Estate is a nascent project called Electionland.

186,"['Four juniors from Florida A&M University were waiting to get into their friend’s apartment building late Saturday night when a white man claiming to live in the building allegedly accosted them before pulling out a gun, according to police and a now-viral social media video. \n \n One of the students, Isaiah Butterfield, captured part of the 10-minute confrontation on video and posted it on Twitter, where it has since been retweeted nearly 6,000 times. \n \n The clip shows a white man wearing a baseball cap claiming to be a resident of the building and then getting into a verbal altercation with the group of black students, before pulling a gun out in an apparent effort to stop them from getting in an elevator. \n \n Social media users and local outlets identified the man as Don Crandall, a manager at the Baymont Inn & Suites by Wyndham Hotels. On Tuesday, the Pax Hotel Group, which owns the inn, posted a statement on Instagram confirming that its general manager was involved, condemned his actions, and said that he had been fired. \n \n ""Our team has gone ahead and took the actions necessary,"" the group said, adding that it does not ""stand behind the actions of our former general manager...we would like to apologize to those affected by the actions of our former employee."" \n \n In a message to residents Monday night, the apartment complex\'s management said Crandall is not a resident of the building, Stadium Centre, which is marketed as off-campus housing to college students in Tallahassee. \n \n “Firearms are prohibited on our property and we take this matter very seriously,” the management said in the message, which Butterfield sent to BuzzFeed News. “Moreover, we are firmly committed to creating a diverse residential community that is inclusive and welcoming to all.” \n \n In an interview, Butterfield described the encounter, which he said occurred while he and three friends — Stephen Brooks, Joshua Cosby, and Fitzroy Rhoden — were waiting at the garage entrance to the apartment building. Another friend, Zavian Flowers, had just moved into the building and was throwing a party, Butterfield said. \n \n As they waited for Flowers to let them in, Crandall walked past them and through the door. \n \n “Then he turned and he said, ‘You aren’t getting in here if you don\'t have a key,’” Butterfield said. “We were shook because we hadn’t said anything to him. We were just standing there and then he closed the door and locked it.” \n \n According to the junior, Crandall, who is white, came back a few moments later and began harassing the students again. The encounter then caught the attention of another man — whom Butterfield identified as “Chad” — who intervened on the students’ behalf. \n \n \n \n “He came at us for no reason and that’s when Chad walked up and I started recording,” Butterfield said. “Chad stood up for us and pushed back on the guy and said we could come in with him.”', 'Danny Iudici/New York Daily News Union members of local 1181 amalgamated were on strike this morning at 1616 Stillwell Ave. in the Bronx at the Little Richie Bus Company.

The strike could drag on for weeks or months. \n \n ""This will go however long it goes,"" Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott told 1010 WINS radio. ""And we\'ll have systems in place to support our parents and our students, acknowledging, though, the first several days will be traumatic for our families and we understand that."" \n \n Joe Marino for New York Daily News \n \n All students affected by the strike got MetroCards Tuesday to take subways and buses to school, but a plan to make the cards available to parents of young children and special education students has been hobbled by bureaucratic delays. \n \n Parent MetroCards won\'t be activated until Thursday because the MTA says it needs up to 72 hours to program the software in 6,000 buses. \n \n ""This will likely lead to chaos during the morning commute as tens of thousands of parents attempt to escort their children to school,"" warned City Councilman David Greenfield (D-Brooklyn). \n \n Parents who drive kids to school will have to keep logs of their travels to get a 55-cent-per-mile reimbursement, while those who use cabs will have to fill out weekly forms and attach receipts for every trip. \n \n Maggie Moroff of Advocates for Children said she\'s worried about disabled students for whom public transportation won\'t work. ""They don\'t have a solid plan for how they\'re going to deal with these more-complicated issues,"" she said. \n \n The union behind the strike, Amalgamated Transit Workers Union Local 1181, is protesting a city plan to bid out private bus contracts with no job guarantees for the union\'s 8,800 drivers and escorts. \n \n Its leaders have promised picket lines at bus yards, and other drivers unions have vowed not to cross those lines. \n \n The bus companies have hired replacement workers, but the new, nonunion drivers won\'t begin this week because they must undergo three days of alcohol and drug tests. The new drivers are getting training, and it\'s not clear when they\'ll try to cross lines to begin work. \n \n Carolyn Daly, a spokeswoman for the companies, noted an increased police presence was expected at bus depots early Wednesday. \n \n Joe Marino/for New York Daily News \n \n The bus companies, meanwhile, delivered a letter to the National Labor Relations Board Tuesday demanding a stop to the strike.

Video of a portion of the Saturday night incident went viral after one of the students, Isaiah Butterfield, posted it on Twitter; Butterfield tells BuzzFeed News that before he started filming, the white man in the video walked past him and his friends and through the building's entrance. ""Then he turned and he said, ‘You aren’t getting in here if you don't have a key,'"" Butterfield says. ""We were shook because we hadn’t said anything to him."" He says the man then came back outside and started harassing the group, at which point another white person walked up and started defending the black students. Butterfield then started filming. The white bystander, who had a key to the building, let the group inside; the first white man then insisted they not get on the elevator with him and asked repeatedly whether they had a key to the building. As the group attempted to enter the elevator, the man pulled out a gun. ""He made sure we saw that he had a gun so we didn't get in the elevator,"" says Butterfield, who notes that the group had earlier questioned whether the man actually lived in the building, since it is student housing and he looked older than most residents. (At one point in the video, the man can be heard saying, ""Where am I going? I am going upstairs to get laid."") The students, who were ultimately let into the building by their friend, reported the incident to police the following day. Building management has since released a statement saying the man in the video is not a resident. Social media users identified him, and his employer announced he has been fired from his position as general manager of a nearby hotel."

And the Las Vegas man has been at it for six years, using a dozen computers and a slew of accounts to help beef up the followings of his 50-or-so clients, who pay him to help them seem more popular and important, reports the Wall Street Journal. And the accounts have gotten more sophisticated: In April, a tough new filter was applied, and the majority of Vidmar's accounts were wiped from the site. And so the vendors that sell the fakes to Vidmar put a little more work into them: The fakes now feature photos, profile details, and tweet a number of times before he buys them; he got 1,000 for $58 from a Pakistan supplier this month. From there, he has the accounts tweet, retweet, follow, and message—all in the name of clients like ""Rapper/Singer/Producer/Guitarist/Fitness Model"" Dave Murrell aka @Fyrare (number of Twitter followers: 238,360).

The patient had thrombocytopenia and leukopenia and was given doxycycline for a presumed tickborne illness. His condition did not improve. Multiorgan failure developed, and he died 11 days after illness onset from cardiopulmonary arrest. Molecular and serologic testing results for known tickborne pathogens were negative. However, testing of a specimen for antibodies against Heartland virus by using plaque reduction neutralization indicated the presence of another virus. Next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis identified the virus as a novel member of the genus Thogotovirus. \n \n The genus Thogotovirus (family Orthomyxoviridae) contains >6 distinct viruses, including Araguari, Aransas Bay, Dhori, Jos, Thogoto, and Upolu viruses (1–3). These viruses have been primarily associated with either hard or soft ticks and have a wide geographic distribution (1–8). The only virus in this genus known to occur in the United States is Aransas Bay virus, which was isolated from soft ticks (Ornithodoros spp.) collected from a seabird nest off the coast of Texas (3). \n \n Two viruses in the genus Thogotovirus (Thogoto and Dhori viruses) are currently known to cause human infection and disease. Antibodies against Thogoto virus have been identified in humans living in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa (1,4,6,8). Two persons from Nigeria infected with this virus were identified in 1966. The first patient was a man with a febrile illness in whom neuromyelitis optica later developed. The second patient was a 14-year-old boy in whom meningitis developed and who died 6 days later because of complications of sickle cell disease (9). \n \n Antibodies against Dhori virus in humans have been reported in a similar distribution as those against Thogoto virus (1,6,8,10). Five patients with disease have been described after accidental laboratory exposure to Dhori virus; encephalitis developed in 2 of these patients (11). We report a novel Thogotovirus associated with a febrile illness and death that occurred in a man in the United States in 2014. \n \n The Case-Patient The patient was a previously healthy man >50 years of age from Bourbon County, Kansas, USA. While working outdoors on his property in late spring 2014, the patient had several tick bites and found an engorged tick on his shoulder several days before he became ill with nausea, weakness, and diarrhea. The following day, a fever, anorexia, chills, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia developed. On the third day of illness, the patient went to his primary care physician, who empirically prescribed doxycycline for a presumed tickborne illness because of his history of tick bites, symptoms, and no reported travel outside the immediate area. The following morning, the patient’s wife found him obtunded (experiencing reduced consciousness) but arousable. He was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. At the hospital, he had a temperature of 37.3°C, a pulse rate of 84 beats/min, and an increased blood pressure of 151/65 mm Hg. The patient had a papular rash on his trunk, but otherwise results of his physical examination were unremarkable. Initial laboratory findings showed leukopenia (2,200 cells/μL), lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 550 cells/μL), thrombocytopenia (72,000 cells/μL), mild hyponatremia (sodium 133 mmol/L), hypokalemia (potassium 3.0 mmol/L), a creatinine level (0.8 mg/dL) within the reference range (0.6 mg/dL–1.2 mg/dL), a slightly increased level of blood urea nitrogen (25 μg/dL), and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (138 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (86 U/L). He was admitted because of the principal problems of dehydration, syncope, and possible tickborne illness. He was given an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus, then maintenance fluids, and doxycycline (200 mg IV every 12 h for the first 24 h, then 100 mg IV every 12 h). Despite doxycycline therapy, the patient continued to report malaise and anorexia, and periodic fevers (maximum temperature 38.8°C) developed. At day 8 postillness onset, the patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for further evaluation and management. Patient samples collected before transfer showed no serologic evidence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, or ehrlichiosis. At initial assessment at the tertiary care center, the patient was febrile (temperature 39.4°C) and had a nontender left axillary lymphadenopathy; a diffuse maculopapular rash on his chest, abdomen, and back; petechiae on his soft palate and lower extremities; and bibasilar crackles in the lung fields. Laboratory testing continued to show mild leukopenia (3,600 cells/μL) but also showed worsening thrombocytopenia (34,000 cells/μL). His renal function was normal, but his aspartate aminotransferase level had increased to 119 U/L. Doxycycline treatment (100 mg IV every 12 h) was continued, and the patient was evaluated further for a potential etiology of his illness. Hematologic results suggested that his persistent thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were secondary to acute bone marrow suppression. A chest, abdomen, and pelvis computed tomography scan with contrast showed trace pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and multiple prominent abdominal lymph nodes. At day 9 postillness onset, he remained lucid and interactive, but he continued to have episodic high fever (temperature >39°C) and progressive dyspnea developed, which resulted in a need for supplemental oxygen. A chest radiograph showed new findings of pulmonary venous congestion and interstitial edema, suggestive of progressive heart failure or fluid overload, and an echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis. Because of increasing supplemental oxygen needs and progressive lactic acidosis, he was transferred to the intensive care unit and given broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs on day 10 of his illness. His renal function began to deteriorate and his aminotransferase levels continued to increase. The patient was intubated because of acute respiratory distress syndrome and was given 3 vasopressor medications because of shock. The patient subsequently had sustained ventricular tachycardia with persistent hypotension and eventual pulseless electrical activity with refractory shock. After multiple resuscitations, the decision was made to withdraw further care, and he died shortly after being extubated, 11 days after first becoming ill. An autopsy was not performed. Results of comprehensive evaluations for tickborne diseases, including serologic testing for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, brucella, babesiosis, and Q fever; molecular testing for Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum; and blood thin smears for Babesia spp. were negative. Results of evaluations for fungal pathogens (Aspergillus spp. galactomannan, antibodies against Histoplasma spp., and Histoplasma spp. antigen in serum and urine) were negative. Evaluations for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and parvovirus showed past infection. Test results for hepatitis B and C viruses, West Nile virus, and HIV were also negative. Blood, sputum, and urine bacterial cultures were negative. A whole blood specimen collected 9 days after illness onset was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Fort Collins, CO, USA) for Heartland virus testing as part of an active institutional review board-approved protocol. \n \n Materials and Methods Clinical Specimen Handling and Evaluation At CDC, EDTA-treated blood, along with serum separated from that blood, were tested for Heartland viral RNA and neutralizing antibodies by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with 6-well plates with confluent Vero E6 monolayers, according to protocols described elsewhere (12,13). Standard virus isolation methods were also used. In brief, 200 μL of undiluted and 1:10 dilutions of blood or serum specimens were inoculated onto confluent Vero cells in T25 flasks. Inoculated flasks were then incubated at 37°C and reviewed for cytopathic effect daily. Viral Genome Sequencing, RT-PCR, and Phylogenetic Analyses Supernatants collected from standard virus isolation cell cultures were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods by using the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and methods as described (14). After novel viral sequences were identified by NGS, a real-time RT-PCR was designed to target the newly derived sequences and applied to blood and serum samples by using methods described (15). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on deduced amino acid sequences from multiple genomic segments of selected viruses of the same viral family by using MEGA 5.05 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/) as described (16). \n \n Results Isolation and Identification of Virus in Blood and Serum Figure 1 Blood and serum showed negative results for Heartland viral RNA and antibodies against this virus. However, heterologous viral (non–Heartland viral) plaques were noted in PRNT cell culture wells, which indicated the presence of another virus (Figure 1). Standard virus isolation methods showed a substantial cytopathic effect at day 3 postinoculation in cells that were inoculated with blood or serum specimens. These findings were confirmed by repeated isolation attempts. Figure 2 Negative stain and thin-section electron microscopy showed pleomorphic viral particles consistent with viruses in the family Orthomyxoviridae (Figure 2). NGS methods applied to cell culture supernatants from multiple isolations showed the presence of novel orthomyxoviral RNA. We observed ≈70% overall average nucleotide sequence percentage identity with Dhori virus in multiple genomic segments. Blood and serum samples were verified as the source of the novel virus by real-time RT-PCR–based detection of viral RNA in these samples. Phylogenetic Analyses Figure 3 Three phylogenies, each generated by a neighbor-joining method applied with 2,000 bootstrap replicates for grouping analysis, were chosen as representative of overall genetic relationships of selected viruses (Figure 3). The novel virus was found to group with strong support along with Dhori virus, and the closely related Batken virus, in all trees. \n \n Discussion Using traditional techniques (i.e., PRNT and culturing on animal cells) in combination with NGS, we isolated a novel virus from a blood sample collected 9 days after illness onset from a previously healthy man. It is likely that this novel Thogotovirus, which we are proposing to call Bourbon virus after the county of residence of the patient, was the cause of his illness. Although it is unclear what role the virus played in the death of the patient, the high level of viremia, as shown by multiple isolations from the blood of the patient 2 days before his death, suggests that this might have contributed to the death of the patient. The patient had a history of tick exposure, as well as symptoms and laboratory findings (i.e., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) consistent with a tickborne illness. Several tickborne pathogens, such as Ehrlichia chaffensis, Rickettsia, and Heartland virus, are present in eastern Kansas and adjacent areas (17–19). However, the patient did not respond to doxycycline therapy initiated 3 days after illness onset and had negative results for these and other tickborne pathogens. Of the 7 symptomatic human infections that have been associated with viruses in the genus Thogotovirus, most case-patients have had neurologic findings (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis) without any described abnormalities in blood counts (9,11). Although cerebrospinal fluid was not tested for the patient reported, his clinical signs and symptoms were not suggestive of neurologic infection. Furthermore, the patient did not have any respiratory symptoms that would be expected with other viruses that are known human pathogens in the large family of Orthomyxoviridae, such as influenza virus (1). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that Bourbon virus is most closely related to Dhori and Batken viruses. However, the branch lengths suggest a relatively distant evolutionary distinction of Bourbon virus from Dhori and Batken viruses, which have only been described in the Eastern Hemisphere. Dhori, Batken, and Thogoto viruses have been identified in various hard tick species (1). However, Batken virus also has been identified in mosquitoes (1). It is currently unknown how Bourbon virus is transmitted to humans. However, illness onset of the patient in late spring and a history of finding an embedded tick before becoming ill support the notion that Bourbon virus might be transmitted by ticks. Therefore, to potentially prevent Bourbon virus disease, as well as other tickborne diseases, persons should be advised to avoid tick bites by using an insect repellent registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency to be effective against ticks, wearing long sleeves and pants, avoiding bushy and wooded areas, and performing tick checks after spending time outdoors. The discovery of Bourbon virus, in addition to recent discoveries of tick-associated Heartland and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome viruses (19,20), suggests that the public health burden of these pathogens has been underestimated. As nonselective molecular methods of pathogen identification (i.e., NGS sequencing) become more widely used, ideally in combination with classical microbiologic techniques, it is anticipated that similar discoveries will be made in the future. It is currently not known how many human infections and disease cases might be attributable to this novel pathogen. On the basis of limited information for our case-patient, health care providers might consider Bourbon virus as a potential infectious etiology in patients in whom fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia develop without a more likely explanation and who have shown negative results for other tickborne diseases (e.g., ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, or Heartland virus disease) or have not responded to doxycycline therapy. Work is planned to identify additional human infections with this novel virus, as well as to explore its potential geographic distribution. Also, more comprehensive virologic characterizations and field work are ongoing to better understand the biology of, and to identify potential vectors and reservoirs for, Bourbon virus. These data will be critical to further characterize the epidemiology and illness caused by Bourbon virus and to implement potential prevention and control measures. \n \n Ms. Kosoy is a microbiologist at the Arboviral Diseases Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n Scientists are reporting on a new virus, never seen before anywhere, that apparently killed a Kansas man last year. \n \n They’re calling it Bourbon virus, after the county in Kansas where the previously healthy man lived. He’d been bitten by ticks before he got sick so doctors believe the virus is carried by ticks. \n \n “We were not looking for a new virus,” said Charles Hunt, Kansas state epidemiologist, who helped report on the new virus. \n \n “We are surprised. We really don’t know much about this virus. It’s important to find out more from a public health perspective. It is possible that other persons have been infected with this and not known it?” \n \n “It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus."" \n \n The research team is not giving details on the man other than that he was healthy, under the age of 50 and working outdoors on his property in eastern Kansas last spring when he came inside with tick bites and one fat tick still on his shoulder. \n \n A few days later, he developed nausea, diarrhea and felt weak. By the third day, he had fever, muscle aches and chills and went to the doctor, who prescribed an antibiotic called doxycycline which can treat several tick-borne infections, including one that causes Lyme disease. \n \n But by the fourth day, the patient was drifting in and out of consciousness and was taken by ambulance to the hospital. He just got sicker, and blood tests cleared him of the usual tickborne illnesses such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, or ehrlichiosis. \n \n His heart started to fail and then his kidneys, and he died 11 days after first becoming ill, the researchers report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n \n Doctors tested his blood for all sorts of infections, from tularemia and Q fever to fungal infections such as aspergillosis. The medical team finally decided to check for another new mystery virus called Heartland virus, another tickborne virus that had only turned up in 2011. \n \n Hunt passed the samples along to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s lab in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is looking for cases of Heartland virus. \n \n Technicians there ran all sorts of tests that came back negative, says the CDC’s Dr. Erin Staples. CDC microbiologist Olga Kosoy noticed a virus growing on the patient’s blood sample. Her colleague Amy Lambert sequenced the virus’s genome using advanced molecular detection. It wasn\'t anything that had been seen before. \n \n “It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus,” Staples told NBC news. \n \n “Thogotoviruses have been described throughout the world.” But they rarely cause human disease, and the closest relative to the virus ever seen in the U.S. was a sample found in a bird’s nest in Aransas Bay, off the coast of Texas. \n \n Staples thinks the new virus may have occasionally infected people, but they never knew what they had. Scientists only recently have possessed the tools and facilities needed to make this kind of identification. \n \n “I think it has probably been present for a while,” Staples said. \n \n When the weather warms up, scientists will visit the area looking for ticks, mosquitoes and perhaps animals that might be carrying the virus. They may also take a look at the blood of people with illnesses that were never definitively diagnosed to see if they have antibodies to Bourbon virus. \n \n “I think it has probably been present for a while."" \n \n In the meantime, people should not worry, but it does give people yet another reason to avoid ticks by wearing long sleeves and using insect repellant outside, Staples and Hunt both said. \n \n The best-known is tickborne disease is Lyme disease, which infected about 30,000 people in the U.S. in 2010. Other infections include anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, which affect about 1,000 people each a year, and babesiosis, which infects about 1,100 people a year. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever infects about 2,500 people a year. \n \n As of March 2014, eight cases of Heartland virus disease have been identified among residents of Missouri and Tennessee, CDC says. \n \n Heartland virus was first noticed in 2009 when two men in Missouri developed high fevers, diarrhea, fatigue and a severe drop in the number of their white blood cells, immune cells that fight infection. The symptoms are very similar to those caused by Bourbon virus in the Kansas man.']",2,"– The Bourbon virus—so named because it first emerged recently in Bourbon County, Kansas—has puzzled researchers. A man with the first known case of the disease died last year, and since then, experts have been working to learn more about it. A new study outlines findings, NBC News reports. ""It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus,"" which have been seen ""throughout the world,"" CDC researcher Erin Staples tells NBC. Just one example of the Thogotovirus has appeared in the US, the researchers write in a CDC publication: Aransas Bay virus, found in ticks in a seabird nest off Texas. Though the Kansas death is the first scientists have linked to the illness, Staples believes it has probably affected others; they just didn't know it. That doesn't mean we should panic, she notes; we should just continue to protect ourselves against ticks, which may be carriers. Mosquitoes and other animals may also be involved, and researchers are preparing to investigate."

(Associated Press) \n \n Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James, bottom, is helped off the floor by forward Jeff Green (32) during the first half of Game 1 of basketball\'s NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors in Oakland, Calif., Thursday, May 31, 2018. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Associated Press) \n \n OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — The Golden State Warriors somehow withstood LeBron James\' latest brilliance on the NBA Finals stage. \n \n A costly blunder by J.R. Smith and a disputed foul call involving James himself sure helped. \n \n Stephen Curry scored 29 points and the Warriors capitalized on Smith\'s mistake that sent the game into overtime, overcoming a 51-point performance by James to beat Cleveland 124-114 in Game 1 on Thursday night. \n \n The game nearly over, James jawed with both Curry and Klay Thompson, then Tristan Thompson and Draymond Green tangled moments later and made contact. After replay review, Tristan Thompson received a Flagrant 2 foul and ejection with 2.6 seconds left. \n \n James was in utter disbelief as regulation ended stunningly: George Hill made the first of two free throws with 4.7 seconds left after being fouled by Klay Thompson, but when Smith secured the rebound of the second, he dribbled back toward halfcourt instead of shooting, apparently thinking the Cavs had a lead. \n \n ""He thought it was over. He thought we were up one,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. \n \n Yet Smith insisted he knew the score. Green figured Smith was simply looking for James, saying, ""I would have looked for LeBron, too."" \n \n ""I just thought we were going to call a timeout. Because I got the rebound, I\'m pretty sure I couldn\'t shoot it over KD,"" Smith said of Kevin Durant. ""If I thought we were ahead, I would have just held on to the ball so they could foul me. Clearly that wasn\'t the case."" \n \n Instead, OT. \n \n And why not? Both these teams were pushed to their limits in seven-game conference finals they each had to win on the road. \n \n ""I can\'t talk about a situation that way because I do some dumb stuff on the court,"" Durant said of how the fourth quarter finished. ""I don\'t know what was going through J.R.\'s head. He made a great rebound and gave them an opportunity to win the basketball game."" \n \n Game 2 is Sunday night back at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors have won 18 of their last 19 postseason games. In 2015, when the Golden State beat the Cavs to capture the franchise\'s first title in 40 years, the first two games of the series went to OT — Golden State winning the opener and Cleveland Game 2. \n \n James shot 19 for 32 to go with eight assists and eight rebounds in the opener of his eighth straight NBA Finals and ninth overall, as well as Cavs-Warriors Take IV. James notched his eighth 40-point game during this playoff run to tie Hall of Famer Jerry West\'s feat in 1965 for most in a single postseason. \n \n ""We\'ve got to move on,"" James said. ""This game is over and done with. We had opportunities."" \n \n James drove past Curry for a three-point play with 50 seconds remaining in the fourth. But James was given a foul following a review with 36.4 seconds left and Durant converted a pair of free throws to tie it at 104. \n \n The call had initially been a charge on 2017 finals MVP Durant and James protested the change — while KD said afterward he thought it was the right decision because ""I knew he was late on the drive and I knew I had my man beat and he came over a little late."" \n \n James called it a ""huge play"" and said ""I knew I was outside the charge line."" \n \n ""I read that play as well as I\'ve read any play in my career, maybe in my life,"" James said. \n \n Rules allow officials to go to replay in the final 2 minutes of regulation or in overtime to determine if a defender attempting to draw a charge was in the restricted area. When doing so, they can view if the defender was in a legal guarding position. They decided James wasn\'t and changed their original call. \n \n Lue was disgusted to lose this way, saying of the overturned call: ""It\'s never been done, ever in the history of the game. And then tonight in the finals on the biggest stage, when our team played well, played our (butt) off, man, it ain\'t right."" \n \n Lue added that the way James played, ""to come up robbed, it\'s just not right."" \n \n Durant struggled to find his stroke but wound up with 26 points on 8-for-22 shooting and nine rebounds. \n \n Golden State got a serious scare when Thompson went down after Smith slid hard into the Splash Brother\'s left leg at the 6:17 mark of the first quarter. Thompson lay grimacing in pain then went to the locker room with what was called a bruised left leg that needed re-taping. He returned for the start of the second quarter to huge roars from the yellow-clad sellout crowd and scored 24 points. He and Curry each connected on five 3s. \n \n Curry drained one of those way-out-there 3-pointers that have been hard to come by this postseason to beat the halftime buzzer and Golden State shot 13 for 36 from deep. \n \n Kevin Love returned from a concussion to provide a big boost for Cleveland with 21 points and 13 rebounds. \n \n The Warriors missed the defensive presence of 2015 NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala, who was out for a fifth straight postseason game dealing with a bone bruise in his left knee. He is scheduled to be re-evaluated ahead of Game 2. \n \n Everybody expects another wild one with so much talent on both sides. \n \n ""It was a crazy game,"" Curry said. ""... The finals, man, anything is liable to happen."" \n \n TIP-INS \n \n Cavaliers: James has 109 career 30-point games in the playoffs, tying Michael Jordan for most ever. ... Cleveland held a 19-4 advantage on the offensive glass, getting seven offensive rebounds in the first half to the Warriors\' none. ... James\' first quarter: 4 for 4 with a 3-pointer, 12 points, three assists, a steal and turnover. \n \n Warriors: Curry\'s early three-point play gave him the free throw he needed for 379 to pass Rick Barry (378) for first place on the Warriors\' career list. ... With his 293rd career 3 in the playoffs, made in the second quarter, Thompson passed Kobe Bryant (292) for sixth place on the NBA\'s list for postseason 3s. ...

It\'s not a selfie, nor a normal photo (which all the cool kids call a ""youie""), but a hybrid of the two. It\'s a composite shot from both cameras on your phone, showing both you and whatever else is out there. It\'s a bothie. \n \n Crazy idea? Maybe. And yet, if history is any indication, you\'ll scoff at the bothie now and then while you\'re not looking they will take over the world. \n \n Now, allow me to introduce you to The Bothie Phone. Technically, it\'s called the Nokia 8. Either way it\'s the first flagship phone from HMD Global, the Finnish company that now owns the Nokia smartphone name. The Nokia 8, in addition to its Bothie-ness, offers most of the trappings of a good phone: 4 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of storage, brand-spankin\'-new processor, crisp 5.3-inch screen, pure Android. It\'s not waterproof and it doesn\'t have a tiny bezel, but it does have some of the standard Nokia design flair. It\'s a clean, slim, softly rounded device that comes in a bunch of cool colors, like blue and orange. It does all the things a good phone should. \n \n But its bothie-bilities set the 8 apart. At least, HMD Global hopes so. The company made the camera rig with the help of longtime Nokia partner Carl Zeiss, and made the phone for the YouTubers and Instagrammers of the world. The phone has three cameras: two 13-megapixel sensors on the back, one color and one monochrome, and another 13-megapixel shooter on the front. Even the audio has been tuned for 360-degree sound. You can fire up the camera, switch to dual-sight mode, and either capture or livestream both views from your device. Viewers will see a split-screen live feed on YouTube or Facebook, so make sure you don\'t absent-mindedly pick your nose or anything. \n \n Such camera-melding techniques are hardly new. The app Frontback offered a similar effect, albeit a more manual one. Samsung, for a while, let you snap a selfie and then drop it into the frame of a photo. You could also make the case that 360 photos are bothies and then some. (Everythingies?) In theory, the feature offers a way to be part of a scene without interrupting it. And since it\'s right next to the most important buttons in your camera app, HMD hopes you\'ll make it part of your social routine. \n \n The Nokia 8 won\'t be available in the US, which will surely disappoint at least a few creators. It\'ll be available in Europe and elsewhere for about 599 euros, which puts the 8 into nearly the top tier of smartphones everywhere. That\'s a lot of pressure to put on the 8\'s camera, its only truly unique feature. HMD\'s smart to emphasize the camera, which has become more and more important to all smartphone users in the Snapchat and Instagram era. But if people do like the feature, other manufacturers and developers can likely copy it quickly. Still, HMD had to make phones for someone, and it picked people who love selfies. That might be the biggest market of them all.']",2,"– With the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers meeting for their fourth straight NBA finals, senators from Ohio and California are keeping things interesting with a bet.

190,"['China Stringer Network / Reuters ID: 6604407 \n \n Supporters of Al Gore have begun a round of conversations among themselves and with the former vice president about his running for president in 2016, the latest sign that top Democrats have serious doubts that Hillary Clinton is a sure thing. \n \n \n \n Gore, 67, won the popular vote in the 2000 election and has been mentioned as a possible candidate in every contested Democratic primary since then. He instead spent much of the 2000s focused on environmental campaigning and business ventures. He has largely slipped out of public view in more recent years. \n \n But in recent days, “they’re getting the old gang together,” a senior Democrat told BuzzFeed News. \n \n “They’re figuring out if there’s a path financially and politically,” the Democrat said. “It feels more real than it has in the past months.” \n \n The senior Democrat and other sources cautioned not to overstate Gore’s interest. He has not made any formal or informal moves toward running, or even met with his political advisers about a potential run. \n \n A member of Gore’s inner circle asked to be quoted “pouring lukewarm water” — not, note, cold water — on the chatter. \n \n “This is people talking to people, some of whom may or may not have talked to him,” the Gore adviser said. \n \n Roy Neel, a former top adviser to Gore, said Thursday he hadn’t spoken to Gore about it and dismissed the idea of a bid. “It’s extremely unlikely,” he said. \n \n Gore himself didn’t immediately reply to an inquiry emailed to his personal account. \n \n Polling this week put Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders ahead of Clinton for the first time in New Hampshire. And she is contending with another round of stories about her use of personal email, and the security of the server on which it was hosted, during her time as secretary of state. \n \n In June, when asked who will be the next president, Gore joked that he would dodge the question, before saying that it was “actually too early” to say. Gore declined to endorse Clinton in 2008, choosing to stay out of the Democratic primary until after Obama secured the nomination. \n \n Gore has had other focuses in recent years. In particular, Gore and a business partner are suing Al Jazeera, which purchased Current TV from him, over $65 million dollars held in escrow during the deal; Gore and his associate contend the money belongs to him. The Qatar-based network acquired Current in early 2013 in a deal reportedly worth $500 million. \n \n \n \n The former vice president has taken a step back from the climate change advocacy groups he helped to found, focusing instead on his business ventures and being a public climate change expert, if not the active lobbyist he once was. Climate change is still a top issue for Gore, and he’s been happy to trash the Keystone XL pipeline, putting him to the left of both President Obama and Clinton on the issue. Both have publicly reserved judgment on the project until a State Department review is complete. \n \n In March, Vox editor Ezra Klein argued that Gore, with his ability to fund a campaign and to mount a serious challenge to Clinton, should run for president. \n \n \n \n Klein cited Gore’s support for single-payer health care, his advocacy on climate change, and his opposition to the Iraq War to make the case that “the rest of his positions are closer in line with Democratic Party activists than, say, Clinton’s.”', 'Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in New York, Wednesday, June 22, 2016. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Associated Press) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in New York, Wednesday, June 22, 2016. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump\'s fierce denunciation of Hillary Clinton on Wednesday was rife with distortion. \n \n He accused Clinton of announcing a withdrawal from Iraq that wasn\'t on her watch, pulled numbers out of nowhere on her plan for refugees and went beyond the established facts behind the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in stating starkly that she ""left him there to die."" In doing so, he assigned her far more influence in the world than she exercised as secretary of state. \n \n A look at some of his assertions and how they stack up with the facts: \n \n TRUMP: ""In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East."" He blamed her for an invasion of Libya that ""handed the country over to ISIS,"" for making Iran the dominant Islamic power in the region and for supporting regime change in Syria that led to a bloody civil war. He charged that her ""disastrous strategy"" of announcing a departure date from Iraq created another opening for ISIS there. \n \n THE FACTS: These statements make only passing acquaintance with reality. \n \n There was no U.S. invasion of Libya. Clinton initially opposed but then sought credit for the NATO-led air campaign to help rebels overthrow Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. (Trump spoke in support of U.S. intervention at the time.) While the violence destabilized Libya, Islamic State inroads there have been more recent and are largely limited to a small coastal area of the country. \n \n Arguments about Iranian domination of the Middle East predate Clinton\'s tenure, going back a decade to the George W. Bush administration\'s deposing of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq. \n \n While secretary of state, Clinton supported arming Syria\'s moderate rebels, but the Islamic State group only arrived later. It\'s unclear what effect such a policy would have had as President Barack Obama rejected the advice at the time. \n \n And she had nothing to do with the ""disastrous strategy"" of giving a departure date from Iraq. It was the George W. Bush administration that announced the planned withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2008. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and his staff ""made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security. They were desperate. They needed help. Hillary Clinton\'s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put them in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die."" \n \n THE FACTS: Trump greatly exaggerates the security requests, not all of which were denied, and gets the history of U.S.-Libyan relations wrong. The reference to security requests appears to reflect the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi\'s tally of ""requests/concerns"" related to the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi. For many of those, there\'s no record of denials. And some security upgrades did occur before the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed Stevens and three other Americans. \n \n Clinton did not start the war in Libya. She supported a NATO intervention well after large-scale violence had broken out between Gadhafi\'s forces and rebels. Nor did the conflict put Stevens or any U.S. diplomat in Libya. The U.S. had maintained a full-fledged embassy there since President George W. Bush re-established diplomatic relations with Gadhafi\'s government in 2006. \n \n Several congressional investigations have shown that Clinton had no role in military decisions related to Benghazi, and that it would have been impossible for U.S. armed forces to intervene in time to save Stevens. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration."" \n \n THE FACTS: For a businessman, Trump is shaky on his numbers. The entire U.S. budget for refugee resettlement is less than $1.2 billion a year — and that includes refugees from Cuba, Bhutan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Even including the value of all future public benefits they might receive — and excluding their contribution to the country through taxes — Trump\'s assertion about the cost of resettlement is still baffling. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""I started off in Brooklyn, New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business that today is worth well over $10 billion."" \n \n THE FACTS: Trump\'s $1 million loan from his father was just the beginning of his family subsidies, which included a far larger inheritance, loan guarantees and even occasional bailouts — one of which was found to be illegal by New Jersey casino regulators. As for the value of Trump\'s business, every independent appraisal has found his assets to be worth far less than he says; Forbes says Trump is worth less than half what he claims. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was secretary of state — plus millions more for her foundation. The sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law. \n \n THE FACTS: Clinton is not sporting Brunei bling. \n \n In September 2012, she accepted a $58,000 jewelry set with gold, sapphire and diamond earrings, a necklace and bracelet, given by the queen of Brunei when Clinton visited for meetings and to inaugurate an English-language training program, according to the Federal Register. The gift was not to her, but to the United States. \n \n Federal law prohibits officials from keeping such gifts unless they pay the estimated value to the U.S. government. According to the State Department\'s protocol office, Clinton chose not to buy the jewelry, and instead turned it over to the General Services Administration — the standard procedure for most gifts from foreign leaders. \n \n It\'s true that Brunei is an Islamic nation that observes Sharia law and has been widely criticized for its human rights record, particularly when it comes to gays and lesbians. \n \n But gift exchanges are standard practice. As with almost all gifts to all officials, the Federal Register notice says ""non-acceptance would cause embarrassment to donor and U.S. government."" \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""Our trade deficit with China soared 40 percent during Clinton\'s time as secretary of state."" \n \n THE FACTS: Trump\'s claim is more than double the actual increase. From late 2008 through 2012, a period coinciding with Clinton\'s tenure, the trade deficit with China rose 17.6 percent. Trump\'s campaign may be using data from the end of 2009 through 2013, when the deficit did rise 40 percent, but that does not match up with Clinton\'s time in office and leaves out a sharp, recession-induced drop in 2009. \n \n More broadly, the secretary of state is not typically held responsible for the trade deficit, which mostly reflects the health of the U.S. and global economies, the difference in how much the nation spends and saves, and trade policies implemented by the U.S. trade representative. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""We are the highest-taxed nation in the world."" \n \n THE FACTS: Closer to the opposite is true. \n \n The U.S. tax burden is actually one of the lowest among the 34 developed and large emerging-market economies that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \n \n Taxes made up 26 percent of the total U.S. economy in 2014, according to the OECD. That\'s far below Sweden\'s tax burden of 42.7 percent, Britain\'s 32.6 percent or Germany\'s 36.1 percent. Only three OECD members had a lower figure: Chile, South Korea and Mexico. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth, with no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from."" \n \n THE FACTS: Clinton has called for the United States to continue to accept refugees, including as many as 65,000 from Syria. But Trump is wrong about Clinton\'s stance on refugee screening. She\'s never said she would scale back the current refugee processing system. Under that system, a person\'s beliefs are not generally a disqualifier for entrance into the U.S. Refugees are checked to make sure they don\'t have criminal records or have been identified by intelligence agencies as having ties to terrorist organizations. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States."" \n \n THE FACTS: It\'s not true that Clinton\'s plan would create open borders. Her plan does call for a pathway to citizenship that would allow people currently in the country illegally to stay, but only after going through a series of steps to become a citizen. On enforcement, Clinton has called for focusing on ""detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety,"" but not ending enforcement outright. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""We will repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare. It is a total disaster."" \n \n THE FACTS: Job growth has been solid by historical standards since Obama\'s health care overhaul was signed into law in March 2010. Since then, employers have added nearly 14 million jobs and businesses have been on the longest hiring streak in the post-World War II era. And 2014 and 2015 were the two best years of private-sector hiring since the late 1990s. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, has fallen to 4.7 percent, an 8 ½ year low, from 9.9 percent when the law was passed. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""We\'ll pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs and lower taxes for everyone."" \n \n THE FACTS: Trump\'s proposed tax cuts are indeed massive, but most economists conclude they will create a huge amount of government debt. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that Trump\'s tax plan would slash government revenue by $9.5 trillion over the next decade. Trump hasn\'t specified any offsetting spending cuts or other sources of revenue to make up the difference. That means the tax cuts would balloon the deficit. All that additional government borrowing could push up interest rates, the center concludes, and offset much of the economic benefit of lower taxes. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Christopher S. Rugaber, Chad Day, Michael Biesecker, Eileen Sullivan, Alicia A. Caldwell, Jeff Horwitz, Nancy Benac, Matthew Lee, Jill Colvin and Cal Woodward contributed to this story.']",2,"– You have one of six possible variations of the APOE gene, having inherited one variant—e2, e3, or e4—from each parent. Reporting in the journal Neuron, University of Hawaii researchers found that the brain development of children as young as preschool age with two copies of e4 or one of e4 and one of e2 seem most adversely affected—an intriguing find in light of previous research that has linked the e4 variant to Alzheimer's. Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to ""diet or cognitive training"" early on could change someone's ""trajectory,"" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's. (Some research suggests that memories lost to Alzheimer's are actually retrievable.)"

Media outlets are calling Gaga ""unrecognizable"" in the trailer; the New York Times went with the headline, ""Yes, That Really Is Lady Gaga in the Trailer for A Star Is Born."" The film, out Oct. 5, is Gaga's feature film debut and Cooper's directorial debut, Consequence of Sound reports. The soundtrack features all original music written by Gaga alongside Cooper and other musicians including Lukas Nelson, Jason Isbell, and Mark Ronson."
192,"['Scientists have learned that upwards of 25 percent of all people who become infected with Ebola show none of the typical symptoms. The finding suggests the recent West African Ebola Epidemic was more widespread than previously thought, and that new methods need to be developed to diagnose and contain the dreaded virus during an outbreak. \n \n \n \n Typically, Ebola produces a panoply of symptoms, including fever, unexplained bleeding, headache, muscle pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing. As is well documented, this virus is particularly deadly, killing between 10 to 80 percent of people who exhibit these symptoms (the statistical spread reflects the divide between those who have access to intensive care and those who don’t). \n \n But as a new study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases shows, a significant portion of people who contract Ebola don’t show any of the typical signs, meaning they’re asymptomatic, or their symptoms are relatively mild and not wholly reflective of how the virus affects most people. In other words, they have “minimally symptomatic infections.” \n \n Prior to the new study, scientists suspected that Ebola, like many other viruses, might not always manifest in the same predictable way. The new study, led by Gene Richardson, a PhD candidate in anthropology at Stanford University and a former fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, now confirms this suspicion, while providing an actual estimate for the rate of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic infections in Ebola patients. \n \n Following the recent West African Ebola Epidemic, Richardson and his colleagues went back to the rural village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a major hotspot for the outbreak. The village, which is home to 900 residents, recorded 34 cases of Ebola during the epidemic, including 28 deaths. Working with a local physician, Richardson’s team tested 187 men, women, and children from Sukudu who had likely been exposed to Ebola, either because they lived in the same household or shared a public toilet with a person known to have had the disease. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Of these, 14 were found to carry an antibody to Ebola—a sure sign that they were infected at some point. A dozen of these villagers said they had no symptoms of the disease, while two recalled having a fever at the time of the outbreak. \n \n It’s now certainly possible that some of these villagers had full-blown symptoms but were fearful of admitting the truth to doctors. Consequently, more research with a larger sample pool will have to be performed. However, Richardson and his colleagues think they’re onto something, and that the villagers were probably telling the truth. \n \n Importantly, the researchers aren’t sure if an asymptomatic person with Ebola can transmit the virus. “They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea,” noted Richardson in a statement. “It’s unclear if they can pass it along it sexually.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n More research is needed to determine if Ebola can be spread by a person who shows no or very few symptoms, but it’s a very distinct possibility. A person with an infection still has Ebola particles in their body, which could find a way to “jump” to another person. But without the typical symptoms, it’s certainly much more difficult. As Richardson noted, the virus might be transmitted sexually, though that still needs to be proven in an asymptomatic individual. \n \n Richardson and his colleagues are now working in other villages in Sierra Leone to get a better handle on the true number of people affected during the crisis. But if the figure of 25 percent is correct—and if Ebola can spread via asymptomatic people (that’s still a big if)—that presents a massive headache for health officials. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Adding insult to injury, the Ebola virus mutated into a deadlier form during the last outbreak, showing an ability to quickly adapt to human biology and become even more virulent. Taken together, these new findings show that Ebola spreads more rapidly and more broadly through a population, highlighting the need for new detection and containment techniques for when the next outbreak hits. \n \n \n \n [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases]', 'By using ELISA to measure Zaire Ebola virus antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. The findings provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. These data also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection. \n \n We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, from October 2015 to January 2016. A blood sample was collected from 187 study participants, 132 negative controls (individuals with a low likelihood of previous exposure to Ebola virus), and 30 positive controls (Ebola virus disease survivors). IgG responses to Ebola glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were measured using Alpha Diagnostic International ELISA kits with plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader. A cutoff of 4.7 U/mL for the anti-GP ELISA yielded 96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity in distinguishing positive and negative controls. We identified 14 seropositive individuals not known to have had Ebola virus disease. Two of the 14 seropositive individuals reported only fever during quarantine while the remaining 12 denied any signs or symptoms during quarantine. \n \n Evidence for minimally symptomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is limited. During the 2013–16 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to published models or projections of intervention effects. In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in quarantined contacts of reported Ebola virus disease cases in a recognized ‘hotspot.’ \n \n With over 28,000 reported cases, the 2013–16 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic is the largest and longest on record. This study provides further evidence that Ebola, like other viruses, causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations that may include minimally symptomatic infection. The findings also suggest that many episodes of human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus in West Africa may have gone undetected in the recent outbreak. This has implications for the definition of Ebola virus disease survivorship, delineation of transmission chains, and future vaccine studies. \n \n In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a recognized Ebola ‘hotspot’ [ 11 ], which we defined as an area with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed EVD attack rate above 2% in a two-month period. \n \n Evidence for minimally symptomatic EBOV infection is limited. During the 2013–16 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to published models or projections of intervention effects [ 7 – 10 ]. Moreover, it is not known if clinical sequelae seen in survivors of EVD (e.g., uveitis) exist in individuals who had minimally symptomatic EBOV infection. \n \n Despite over 28,000 reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the 2013–16 pandemic as of March 27, 2016 [ 1 ], we are only beginning to trace the complex biosocial processes that have promoted spread of the virus [ 2 , 3 ]. Important questions remain, including how to best use tools such as new vaccines [ 4 ] and rapid diagnostic tests [ 5 ] to contain future outbreaks, the extent to which symptomatic individuals do not present for care, how to identify and manage clinical sequelae of EVD [ 6 ], and the incidence and transmission dynamics of minimally symptomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. \n \n In addition to the 16 confirmed EBOV infections with a fatal outcome, the 12 probable deaths from EVD, and 6 confirmed EBOV infections who survived (34 total cases), our serosurvey identified an additional 14 individuals who were anti-GP ELISA IgG-positive. Two of these individuals reported fever during the quarantine period, and 12 were classified as minimally symptomatic, contributing 25% (binomial exact 95% CI, 14% to 40%) to the total caseload. After including the 2 undocumented symptomatic cases with the 34 reported by the DERC, we calculated a 78% symptomatic case fatality ratio (binomial exact 95% CI, 61% to 90%). \n \n Data analyses. We considered participants to have had minimally symptomatic EBOV infection if they 1) had an anti-GP ELISA above the cut-off as determined in the validation sub-study and 2) denied symptoms consistent with EVD during the period of active transmission in the village. \n \n Laboratory analyses. Of the 187 exposed individuals tested, none of whom were previously known to have EVD, we identified 14 (7.5%) who tested positive by anti-GP ELISA ( Fig 3 ). Two (14.3%) of these 14 reported fever during quarantine while the remaining 12 denied any signs or symptoms during quarantine. \n \n Table 1 shows that 57.8% of participants were male, 35.8% were less than 15 years of age, 48.6% worked outside the home (mostly as farmers or miners), and 79.1% had completed primary school or less. Among exposed participants who were quarantined, 50.2% shared a public latrine with a confirmed case, and 49.8% slept in the house of a confirmed case. \n \n Survey. We collected the following data from study participants: age, gender, occupation, education level, whether or not they shared a room with a confirmed case of EVD, and whether they had signs or symptoms consistent with EVD that were severe enough to prompt seeking of care during the time of their village outbreak. Specifically, these included fever or unexplained bleeding or any three of the following: headache, myalgia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, hiccups, breathing problems, or difficulty swallowing [ 13 ]. Other household members verified signs and symptoms. \n \n Of 193 individuals from Sukudu who were quarantined for sharing a public latrine or living quarters with a confirmed case, only 4 declined to participate. Ten individuals were initially excluded because of fever at the time of initial contact; none of these met the case definition for EVD. On reassessment one week later, all but one had defervesced and were able to provide blood samples. Two participants had failed venipuncture attempts for blood draw. We thus sampled a total of 187 individuals for anti-GP in 24 of 25 previously quarantined houses as defined above (the members of 1 quarantined household could not be located). \n \n We recruited healthy children and adults age 4 and older who had been placed under quarantine during the period of active Ebola transmission in Sukudu. None of these individuals had participated in an Ebola vaccine trial. Each potential participant was screened for fever or symptoms consistent with EVD, and he/she was excluded if any were present. Medical referral to a nearby Partners In Health-supported clinic (which provides free medical care to those unable to pay) was provided. \n \n Study population. We conducted a serosurvey in Sukudu, a village of approximately 900 inhabitants (100 households) that was one of three major ‘hotspots’ in Kono District. We obtained a list of quarantined houses and EVD cases from the Kono DERC and verified it with the town chiefs and youth leaders. We also interviewed members of all of the affected households and discussed the identification of EVD cases with them to triangulate DERC records. We defined potential participants as having been exposed to EBOV if they stayed in a house that was quarantined based on sharing a public latrine with a confirmed case or based on a confirmed case living there. All homes were geolocated using a remotely sensed image ( Fig 2 ). \n \n Fig 1 provides ROC curves and AUCs for the individual and combined ELISA assays. AUCs for the anti-GP, anti-NP, and combined assays were 0.992 (SE = 0.005, 95% CI = 0.983–1.000), 0.975 (SE = 0.010, 95% CI = 0.956–0.995), and 0.997 (unable to determine CIs as the combined ROC was generated through logistic regression), respectively, suggesting that these three tests were statistically equivalent. The cutoff for the anti-GP ELISA that yielded optimal sensitivity (96.7%) and specificity (97.7%) was 4.7 U/mL. \n \n To determine overall accuracies for the two ELISAs in combination and individually, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared the areas under the curve (AUCs) for the individual and combined anti-GP and anti-NP tests [ 12 ]. The cutoff for a positive test was established by ROC analysis, defined as the point along the ROC curve that gave the highest sum of sensitivity (%) and specificity (%). \n \n We assessed anti-glycoprotein (anti-GP) and anti-nucleoprotein (anti-NP) responses to EBOV by means of commercial ELISA kits (AE 320620–1 and AE 320520–1, respectively) from Alpha Diagnostic International (ADI), San Antonio, TX, USA. These were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader (Awareness Technologies, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA). Values are reported in units per milliliter (U/mL) with the use of reference antibody provided by the manufacturer. \n \n We recruited 30 EVD survivors as positive controls by contacting the director of the Kono Survivors’ Group and requesting that she identify individuals interested in participating in a serosurvey. Using Kono DERC records, we verified that survivors had been admitted to an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) and had a documented RT-PCR positive result for EBOV. To identify a group of people whom we considered at very low risk of previous EBOV infection to serve as negative controls, we used Kono DERC records to locate three villages in Kono District in which no Ebola cases had been reported: In the villages of Tombodu, Wardu, and Njagbwema, we recruited 132 individuals who denied contact with Ebola cases both inside and outside of their communities. \n \n Kono is a diamond-rich district in eastern Sierra Leone which reported 301 cases of EVD (that is, RT-PCR confirmed individuals who presented for isolation or were identified by surveillance teams) between August 2014 and February 2015 (Kono District Ebola Response Centre (DERC), personal communication). Several of the authors worked closely with the Kono DERC, British military, and International Federation of the Red Cross on containment, isolation, and surveillance during the time of active transmission in the district. Parts I and II of this study were conducted from October 2015 to January 2016 by a team consisting of two physicians, a physician-anthropologist, a laboratory technician, and two community health workers. \n \n The study protocol was approved by the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee and the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (Protocol ID: 33882). We held meetings with Paramount, Sectional, and Town Chiefs to discuss the proposal and supply them with written information. We then held town meetings to describe the project and answer community questions. Individuals provided written informed consent or placed a thumbprint after hearing a consent script read in the Krio or Kono languages (both ethics committees approved the use of an oral script and thumbprint for those participants who could not read or write); parents signed for children under the age of 18, and children and adolescents provided verbal assent. Subjects received 50,000 Leones (~$10 US) for their participation in the study. \n \n Discussion \n \n One year after the peak of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we identified positive IgG responses to Zaire-EBOV in 14 individuals not known to have had EBOV infection from a village classified as a hotspot for Ebola transmission. Of these, the majority reported having had no symptoms consistent with EVD during the epidemic while two reported only fever. Thus, we provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. In addition, our data suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the epidemic. \n \n Although it was difficult to verify symptoms through our retrospective interviews (given the considerable denial of EVD during the outbreak due to stigma and the fear of being admitted to an ETU where those admitted were seldom discharged), our data indicate that 25% of EBOV infections may have been minimally symptomatic, which is similar to the data from empiric studies and to recent modeled estimates [14]. \n \n The phenomenon of previously undetected, minimally symptomatic EBOV infection was evident around the discovery of the virus in 1976. Using an immunofluorescence assay, the World Health Organization/International Study Team found that 19% of contacts of EVD cases—very few of whom gave any history of illness—had antibodies to the virus [15]. In 2000, Leroy and colleagues published a study (based on ELISA/Western blot) and found that of 24 asymptomatic close contacts of Gabonese patients with EVD, 11 developed both IgM and IgG responses to Ebola Zaire antigens, indicating viral infection [16]. Other investigators have found evidence of seropositive individuals in areas without large outbreaks using ELISA and postulate that there may have been active circulation of filovirus without apparent clinical manifestations [17,18]. Heffernan and colleagues also used ELISA in Gabon and found that 1% of individuals in an epidemic zone had IgG antibodies to Ebola Zaire virus, yet no history of exposure [19]. In another study in Gabon, Becquart and colleagues found a 15.3% Ebola Zaire IgG seroprevalence in 220 randomly selected villages and concluded that most of the seropositive persons identified “probably had mild or asymptomatic infection” [20]; however, they used uninfected individuals in France as negative controls. We found that unexposed expatriates (not included as negative controls) had a significantly lower mean log anti-GP (M = 5.25 U/mL, SD = 0.54, N = 12) than unexposed Sierra Leoneans (M = 6.40 U/mL, SD = 1.06, N = 132) using the two-sample t-test for unequal variances, t(20.05) = 6.40, P< = 0.001 (see Fig 3), potentially due to cross-reactivity of our assay with closely related pathogens circulating in the region. \n \n Our study has several possible limitations. First, if asymptomatic EBOV infection is a common occurrence, it is possible that some of the “true negatives” used for the validation of our ELISA assays could have been infected with EBOV. We did not use a microneutralization assay for comparison purposes, nor did our pool of EVD survivors represent all of the possible antibody titers in the regional population. Although the serologic assay conferred sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%, the assay protocol produced antibody titers that were considered qualitative in nature. Second, we relied on study participants and their household contacts’ memories of events that had taken place up to a year prior when we classified them as symptomatic or asymptomatic (potential recall bias); however, during the outbreak, most quarantined households were monitored daily by surveillance teams that conducted symptom screens and measured temperatures, and individuals were brought to treatment facilities for EBOV testing if they screened positive. Third, our IgG assays indicate previous infection but provide no information on when that infection took place. The 3 negative controls with positive tests either represent false positives due to cross-reactive antibodies or previously infected individuals. (We did not perform IgM ELISAs, as other investigators have demonstrated that Ebola IgM titers largely diminish within 60 to 90 days of symptom onset [21,22].) Fourth, we did not ascertain whether there were non-quarantined individuals who had minimally symptomatic infection. \n \n Our study focused on the quarantined population of one village. Extrapolation of our findings to other villages and generalizability to the epidemic should be approached with caution. Although many of the study participants were followed by surveillance teams during the time of active EBOV transmission in their village, the timing of the possible infection cannot be known from IgG data, and it is improbable that surveillance teams followed each individual throughout the duration of the outbreak in Sierra Leone. Thus, the concern that IgG positive persons indeed had but denied symptoms cannot be excluded. \n \n Despite these limitations, our serosurvey provides a deeper perspective on EBOV transmission, and more village-level serosurveys could enhance our understanding of undetected EBOV transmission at the epidemic level. Furthermore, our findings suggest there would be value in exploring the interaction of seropositive persons and EVD cases to improve our understanding of exposure risk. As a result, we may learn more about how efforts at containment can be improved. The data also have important implications for future vaccine studies that rely on detecting antibody to EBOV. Lastly, the findings support the World Health Organization’s interim guidance on clinical care for survivors of EVD, which defines a survivor as a person: \n \n With a confirmed positive result on RT-PCR testing for EBOV on any body fluid who subsequently recovered; \n \n And/or \n \n And/or Who is IgM and/or IgG positive on serological testing for EVD and has not been vaccinated against EBOV [23]. \n \n There is ongoing discussion in West Africa over the definition of survivorship, usually specified by having a positive EBOV RT-PCR result and discharge from an ETU. Plans are underway to develop national registries and provide ID cards to such survivors, so as to delineate individuals eligible for free social and medical support services. Should the notion of survivorship be extended to all those who are IgG positive, including those who had minimally symptomatic infection or who were sick but were never tested at the time of illness? How we define a community of suffering is always problematic and should be revisited given that this definition has implications for identity, stigma, and access to social and medical services. \n \n In conclusion, by using ELISA to measure Zaire-EBOV antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with minimally symptomatic EBOV infection.', 'Between 2013 and 2016, tens of thousands of people in West Africa contracted Ebola virus disease, making the epidemic the largest and longest on record. But the number of reported cases -- roughly 28,000 -- may be an underestimate of the total number of people infected, since it includes only people who showed symptoms of disease. Researchers reporting in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases have discovered individuals in Sierra Leone who showed no signs of the disease but have evidence of prior Ebola infection in their immune systems. \n \n An estimated 10-80 percent of people who show symptoms of Ebola virus disease (EVD) die, depending on their access to intensive care. However, researchers have also seen some evidence that a minority of people may catch the Ebola virus without developing symptoms. During the 2013-2016 outbreak, however, these so-called ""minimally symptomatic infections"" were not considered epidemiologically relevant to models, projections, or intervention efforts so were not studied or tracked in detail. \n \n From October 2015 through January 2016, a year after the peak of the Ebola epidemic, Eugene Richardson, of Partners In Health, and colleagues conducted a survey of people living in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, a village of 900 inhabitants which had been a major ""hotspot"" of Ebola. The team identified 193 adults and children over age 4 who had lived with or shared a latrine with a confirmed case of Ebola during the period of active transmission but were never identified as EVD cases. The researchers collected blood from 187 of these individuals. They then tested the blood samples -- as well as positive and negative controls from known Ebola cases and people not exposed to the virus -- for Ebola glycoprotein antibodies, the presence of which indicates a past Ebola infection. \n \n Of the 187 exposed individuals, none of whom were previously known to have Ebola virus disease, the researchers identified 14 who tested positive for Ebola antibodies. Two of these 14 admitted having a fever while being quarantined, while the other 12 denied any signs or symptoms. However, the study could not pinpoint the timing of any past infection, nor guarantee that any individuals were not prevaricating about a lack of symptoms. The results also can\'t be extrapolated to other villages affected by the outbreak without more data. \n \n ""The findings provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection,"" the researchers write. ""These data also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak."" \n \n ### \n \n Please contact plosntds@plos.org if you would like more information about our content and specific topics of interest. \n \n All works published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases are open access, which means that everything is immediately and freely available.

A new PLOS study finds that some people with the virus show mild or no symptoms at all—a potential concern for preventing its spread. Researchers who visited the village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a hot spot in the recent West African Ebola outbreak, found up to 25% of Ebola infections ""may have been minimally symptomatic,"" meaning ""a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected"" in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, NBC News reports. At least 28,000 people are known to have been infected during the epidemic, at least 11,000 of whom died. In Sukudu, there were 34 known Ebola cases, including 28 deaths among 900 residents, reports Gizmodo. A year after the worst of the outbreak was over, Stanford University researchers tested the blood of 187 people in Sukudu who'd lived with or shared a toilet with someone infected with Ebola, per a release. They found 14 had Ebola antibodies, suggesting they'd previously been infected, while 12 said they didn't recall feeling sick or having a fever. Believing them to be truthful as health workers kept an eye on villagers during the outbreak, researchers now plan to visit other villages ""so we can begin to answer the question of what was the true burden of disease,"" the study author says.

193,"['AKRON, Ohio -- After police officers killed people in Missouri, New York and Cleveland, Akron is distributing cards to middle and high school students to advise citizens on how to behave when stopped by police. \n \n The palm card, which reads ""You and the Law"", is the product of the Akron PeaceMakers, Mayor Don Plusquellic\'s anti-crime and violence group of Akron-area high school students. The card has 15 bullet points, some of which tell the reader to engage politely with officers, i.e. ""Don\'t bad mouth police."" Others which provide more direct advice, such as ""Answer all questions pertaining to your identity,"" and ""Stay in the driver\'s seat with both hands in sight on the steering wheel."" \n \n A quote at the top of the flier says ""The easiest way to avoid conflict with law enforcement officials is simply to stay out of trouble."" \n \n PeaceMakers President and STEM High School Junior Myia Culbreath helped present the cards to the media at Akron City Council chambers Wednesday. She said the group was sparked to create the cards after the death of Tamir Rice. Protestors in Cleveland and Akron took to the streets in November when a Cleveland police officer shot and killed 13-year-old Tamir while he was playing with an airsoft-type gun in a park. \n \n ""After the unfortunate incidents in Ferguson (Missouri), New York and Cleveland, we the Akron PeaceMakers were waiting for something positive to come out of it,"" said Akron STEM High School Junior Myia Culbreath, the group\'s president. ""Our thought was, we all have an obligation to educate one another in these matters."" \n \n Plusquellic stood in front of a group of PeaceMakers Wednesday to unveil the card, which will first be distributed to Akron Public School students. \n \n ""A lot of this is so common sensical, but some people don\'t think about \'Oh what happens when I reach in for my license,\'"" Plusquellic said. \n \n The Peacemakers conceived the cards two weeks ago, Plusquellic said, and were advised by Akron Assistant Police Chief Charles Brown and retired police Sergeant Willa Keith. \n \n The pamphlets have personal significance for Billy Soule, who directs the PeaceMakers assistant to the mayor for community relations. Soule\'s son was carrying a toy gun years ago when he was stopped by police at Rolling Acres Mall. \n \n ""I thought my message (to him) went through, but it didn\'t,"" Soule said. ""Officers surrounded the boys with guns drawn and told them to go down to the ground. My son is alive today because he listened."" \n \n The cards will first be distributed to schools, Soule said, but will also be distributed to churches, community houses, block watch groups and board meetings. \n \n ""We want to get these cards into the hands of as many people as possible,"" Soule said.', 'For Students In Ohio, A Crib Sheet For Interacting With Police \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption M.L. Schultze /WKSU M.L. Schultze /WKSU \n \n This week, every middle and high school student in Akron, Ohio, is getting a glossy, two-sided card giving them suggestions for dealing with police. \n \n It\'s a collaboration between an anti-violence youth group and the city\'s police department. \n \n The ""You and the Law"" cards begin with the big picture: Stay out of trouble. And then a rapid succession of 15 points — control your emotions, answer questions about your identity, put your hands on the steering wheel in plain sight. \n \n The back of the card advises students to report police misconduct and includes phone numbers to call. \n \n The youth group is known as Akron PeaceMakers. Member Devin Clark says it raised $1,500 to print 50,000 of the cards. \n \n ""When they get put in the situation, they\'re going to look back at that card and be like, \'Wow. You know, that helped when I actually read that.\' It\'ll put them in a better position,"" Clark says. \n \n The cards are getting lots of praise from adults, but they\'re now heading out to a tougher audience. \n \n At Firestone High School on the city\'s northwest side, the reaction is largely one of interest, with some debate over the responsibility of officers in encounters. \n \n Student Rachel Cooke says it\'s important that the cards recognize that police can be the transgressors. \n \n ""I\'m not saying that all cops are bad, but there are cops that are drunk on their power, I would say. So I think that it holds them responsible so they can stay in line,"" Cooke says. ""They have to obey the law just like we do."" \n \n In a quieter spot across from the cafeteria, Ryan Hall says he expects and welcomes the debate — better in a high school cafeteria than on the street. \n \n ""This is almost a preventative measure,"" Hall says. ""In many cases it was a small situation that has escalated to end up being a much larger situation."" \n \n The idea for the cards came from a meeting in December, soon after police in nearby Cleveland shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice on a playground. \n \n Billy Soule is Akron\'s liaison with the PeaceMakers. He says the kids wanted to see more than protests. \n \n ""We were hoping that someone within the community would say, \'We need a mechanism to tell our kids what to do,\' "" Soule says. \n \n So the kids did it themselves. \n \n Though some argue the cards go too far in supporting the police point of view, these kids disagree. They say it was crucial that the cards also include advice to document and report police misconduct. \n \n Ryan Hall says it\'s a matter of letting people know they have options.

So the Akron PeaceMakers, an anti-violence youth group, brainstormed with the local PD to come up with a double-sided crib sheet of tips for kids to follow when interacting with cops, NPR reports. The ""You and the Law"" cards, set to be doled out to all Akron middle school and high school students—and possibly to adults, and internationally, in the future—feature 15 bullet points outlining ""basic rights and responsibilities,"" as well as suggestions to ensure safety during an encounter. ""Do not 'bad-mouth' or walk away from the law-enforcement officials,"" ""control your emotions,"" and ""do not resist arrest for any reason"" are some of the tips. The top of each card mentions the ""easiest way to avoid conflict with law enforcement officials is simply to stay out of trouble."" The cards have sparked a debate over whether the police are escaping their own responsibility in confrontations, NPR notes. But the kids involved say the point is to de-escalate the situation, not let cops off the hook—and there are phone numbers on the back to report police misconduct.

Sign Up \n \n SANTA ROSA (CBS SF) — Hundreds of protesters gathered in Santa Rosa and in cities throughout the Bay Area and the state Saturday to protest the police killing of 13-year-old Andy Lopez in Sonoma County last month as well as what they say is an epidemic of police brutality. \n \n The protests in Santa Rosa, San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento Los Angeles and elsewhere were part of a “National Day of Action for Andy Lopez” organized by the Answer Coalition and the California Statewide Coalition Against Police Brutality. \n \n Andy was walking and holding a toy AK-47 rifle in rural Sonoma County the afternoon of Oct. 22 when county sheriff’s deputies on patrol in the area spotted him and yelled for him to drop the weapon, according to the sheriff’s office. \n \n When the boy turned toward the deputies, Deputy Erick Gelhaus, 48, shot him seven times, according to authorities. \n \n Andy’s family has filed a civil rights lawsuit against Gelhaus and the county. \n \n The killing has sparked outrage within the community, state and nationwide, with many decrying the incident as a tragic example of police brutality that protesters say often targets low-income black and Latino citizens. \n \n “We are heartbroken and outraged that Andy Lopez was murdered by Erick Gelhaus of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Department,” said Christina Arechiga, an organizer with the California Statewide Coalition Against Police Brutality. “We demand police terror on American citizens stop immediately. We demand Justice for Andy Lopez, his family and his community.” \n \n During Saturday’s protest in Santa Rosa, volunteers were in the process stories from attendees about their own experiences with police brutality, Arechiga said. \n \n “A lot of people are afraid to come forward, but in light of the Lopez family’s courage and these community gatherings, there’s a lot of stories being told,” said Arechiga, whose cousin Ernest Duenez, Jr. was shot and killed by a police officer in Manteca two years ago. \n \n In Oakland Saturday afternoon, more than 100 protesters took part in the national day of action, marching from the Fruitvale BART station to the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, said Answer Coalition organizer Michelle Schudel. \n \n Schudel said people came from throughout the East Bay to protest Andy’s killing and to stand in solidarity with his family and others who have lost loved ones to police fire. \n \n She said the killing is similar to what people “have to deal with in Oakland and in San Francisco, where police are brutalizing and targeting our families, our communities for being African American or Latino.” \n \n Organizers said more than 100 protesters gathered for about an hour Saturday afternoon at the 24th and Mission BART station in San Francisco to speak out against Andy’s death. \n \n (Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

(Conner Jay/The Press Democrat) X In announcing her decision, Ravitch released a 52-page summary of her findings that includes several new details about the shooting, including that Lopez was likely high on marijuana at the time he was killed. Blood samples taken from Lopez's body during the autopsy revealed significant levels of THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana, according to the report. The levels were consistent with Lopez smoking marijuana 60 to 75 minutes prior to his death, according to Dr. Reese Jones, a specialist hired by the District Attorney's Office to review the findings. Lopez also had a joint and a bottle of Visine on his body at the time he was killed, according to the report. The THC levels in Lopez's system likely affected his behavior that day, Jones said. “Cognitive and behavioral effects that typically follow marijuana use would likely have been present to a significant degree during the interval following,” Jones wrote, according to the report. A 13-year-old boy high on marijuana would likely have had suffered “impaired judgment, slowed decision making and increased mental processing time,” the report found, “particularly when having to deal with performance of a sudden, unanticipated tasks, including decisions that needed to be quickly responded to.” View as one page 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 2 of 7) The new information provides potentially important context for the day of the shooting and may help explain why Lopez did not initially drop the gun when ordered and instead turned toward officers. Gelhaus, a 24-year Sonoma County deputy and Iraq War veteran, told Santa Rosa police investigating the shooting that he thought Lopez was carrying a real assault rifle when he ordered the boy to drop the gun. Lopez did not drop the gun and instead began to turn, the barrel of the airsoft gun rising as he pivoted, according to police. The deputy fired eight rounds, striking him seven times. Investigators determined Gelhaus feared for his life and prosecutors concluded his response — including the number of shots he fired, in a span of several seconds — was reasonable, Ravitch said. She noted that Gelhaus's weapon holds 18 rounds and can fire eight rounds in two seconds. “The evidence establishes that while in the lawful performance of his duties, Deputy Gelhaus was faced with a highly unpredictable and rapidly evolving situation,” Ravitch said. “Given his training and experience, he believed honestly and reasonably that he was faced with a do-or-die dilemma.” His options were to wait for Lopez to fire what he believed to be a deadly weapon at him and his partner, or to fire at Lopez “when the threat was turned toward him,” Ravitch said. “Here the implementation of lethal force was a reasonable response under the circumstances according to all the evidence that we have reviewed,” she said. The announcement was met with outrage outside the 2 p.m. press conference at the county government administration complex, where protesters denounced Ravitch's decision and vowed to press for justice for Lopez. One carried a sign that read simply “Shame.” Jonathan Melrod, an attorney and one of the most vocal activists, said Ravitch's decision was based on “patent lies.” View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 3 of 7) He described Lopez as “a boy with a toy gun who did not pose a threat to anyone, to the deputy, to the neighborhood. He was a kid!” Melrod screamed into a scrum of television cameras. “That is an injustice that cannot be permitted!” He and others who have called for Gelhaus' prosecution said the shooting was a consequence of the wider militarization of the nation's police departments. “The police feel that we the community are their enemy,” Melrod said. “They police us as though they are still in Iraq or Afghanistan.” Melrod later said he had been unaware that Lopez had marijuana in his system until informed by a reporter. He said the focus on marijuana in the report was a “transparent attempt” to deflect blame away from “the sheriff's deputy who pulled the trigger and to place it on Andy Lopez.” “Let's assume there was THC. Does that justify executing Andy?” said Melrod, who questioned why Ravitch waited until now to raise the issue. Nicole Guerra, who said her son Antonio was one of Lopez's best friends, called the idea that Gelhaus didn't commit a crime “ridiculous.” “These kids now have to walk around in fear because they know these cops can get away with murder,” Guerra said. Activists gathered in Roseland Monday afternoon and evening for a march to the Moorland Avenue location where Lopez was killed. They planned a rally for 1 p.m. Tuesday in Old Courthouse Square. The decision comes eight months after the fatal encounter on the outskirts of southwest Santa Rosa. Word of the decision spread quickly after Ravitch's office sent out an email announcing the news conference Monday and mistakenly attached a press release detailing her decision. About 12 p.m., Arnoldo Casillas, the Lopez family's attorney, said he received a personal phone call from Ravitch informing him of her decision. “The family and my office are greatly disappointed with the decision,” Casillas said. “If there was ever a case where charges were warranted, it was this one.” View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 4 of 7) Casillas said the decision would allow the family's federal civil rights lawsuit against Gelhaus and the county to go forward. The suit accuses the deputy of acting recklessly and seeks unspecified damages. Sonoma County Sheriff Steve Freitas said that the district attorney's conclusion mirrored his office's internal investigation into the shooting. He said he is “absolutely confident that it was a thorough investigation, fair and impartial.” “In this case I think the evidence shows both deputies absolutely believed they were faced with a real AK-47,” Freitas said. The other deputy on patrol with Gelhaus, Michael Schemmel, an eight-year veteran with the Marin County Sheriff's Office who was hired by Sonoma County in September, did not fire his weapon. Gelhaus, a firearms instructor who returned to work Dec. 10, has been on duty in the department's armory and not on patrol in the community. Freitas said his commanders will talk with Gelhaus and make a decision about whether his assignment will change. Gelhaus' safety will be a factor in that decision, he said. Gelhaus' attorney Terry Leoni said she was notified at about 11 a.m. Monday that her client will not face criminal charges. She called Gelhaus, who is out of the area on a prescheduled vacation, and said he was “very relieved.” “This has been an extremely difficult time for Erick. He has certainly grieved for the Lopez family,” Leoni said. “It hasn't been easy for him in terms of the media and public scrutiny but also for the loss of this child.” Leoni said that she and her client had been “in the dark” throughout much of the investigation, although they cooperated by providing statements and information when needed. “You're always concerned whether the charging agency or District Attorney's Office is going to make the right choice, look at the law, apply the facts of the law,” Leoni said. “There's always a concern that they will be swayed by the political aspects or mob mentality. We are glad the District Attorney's Office took (its) time.” View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 5 of 7) Santa Rosa Police Chief Hank Schreeder said that his officers didn't recommend an outcome when they handed their investigation to the District Attorney's Office on Jan. 29. “The District Attorney has to decide on the points of law. We are just the fact finders,” Schreeder said. Ravitch, who has faced criticism over the length of her inquiry, called her review of the police investigation into the shooting “exhaustive and thorough,” resulting in reports that totaled more than 1,000 pages. District Attorney investigators responded to the scene Oct. 22 and worked alongside Santa Rosa police called in to investigate, with assistance from Petaluma police. Ravitch said she assigned an attorney and an investigator who both have significant homicide experience to conduct her office's review and ensure any additional investigative steps took place. She said she chose people who don't have longstanding ties to Sonoma County law enforcement to ensure neutrality. The bulk of their work began after receiving the Santa Rosa Police Department's report on the shooting. That report included interviews with about 200 witnesses, 200 hours of recorded interviews and 175 items of evidence, among other materials, Ravitch told reporters at the press conference Monday. The investigative team re-interviewed witnesses and spoke with a pathologist hired by the Lopez family who conducted an additional autopsy. They also consulted with numerous outside sources, including people with expertise in how people perform in high-stress encounters, and an weapons expert who estimated it would take two seconds to fire eight rounds with the type of gun Gelhaus used. The office even hired a company to do a 3D analysis of the trajectory of the eight shots Gelhaus fired. It concluded that the first shot likely missed Lopez, hitting a home behind him. The next one likely struck him in the upper left arm as he was “directly facing” the deputy, the report found. The remaining six shots probably hit him as he was turning, falling down or had hit the ground, the report found. A total of 19 seconds elapsed from the time of the initial call for backup to the time “shots fired” was first reported to dispatchers, Ravitch said. View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 6 of 7) Schemmel, a trainee who was at the wheel of the patrol car, was still getting into a defensive position when Gelhaus fired his weapon from behind an open passenger-side door, the report stated. Ravitch said she released a synopsis of the shooting inquiry to address public concerns about transparency. She described her investigation as a limited inquiry into criminal liability of the deputy. “Police tactics, training, and civil liability are not matters to be addressed by our office or this report,” she said. The Sonoma County Grand Jury will receive the district attorney's full report and all exhibits, as well as the Santa Rosa Police Department's investigative reports. A copy of the report will also be sent to U.S. Department of Justice representatives at the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office which are involved in a federal civil rights review. The state Attorney General's Office declined to review the report because it found no conflict or other cause that called for an independent review, Ravitch said. Ravitch said she is aware the decision will not alleviate the pain felt by the Lopez family and others in the community. “It is incumbent upon us to move forward to address the many layers of concern uncovered by this tragedy, and work together to rebuild trust and support for all members of this community,” she said in a statement. In a statement expressing sympathy for the Lopez family and friends and others involved in the incident, Freitas suggested one way the community could come together was to support legislation requiring imitation firearms such as the one Lopez was carrying be made of either brightly colored or translucent materials. California Senate Bill 199, co-authored by state Sen. Noreen Evans, D-Santa Rosa, would expand the federal law that requires imitation firearms be sold with an orange tip, a feature that had been removed from the gun Lopez was carrying when he was shot. View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 7 of 7) A section of the gun Lopez was carrying was made with translucent plastic, but the difference is difficult to notice at a distance. The new law would require enough translucent material to allow “unmistakable observation of the device's complete contents,” Freitas said. The sheriff said a review of deputy-involved shootings over the past 10 years — something he said he ordered in March 2013, before Lopez was shot — should be completed and made public by the end of the year. “Going forward, I am hopeful that through meaningful collaborative effort, we can assemble the building blocks of prevention, improved communication, and community trust and confidence in the Sheriff's Office and our staff,” he said. On Monday, local law enforcement agencies were alerted that Ravitch was planning to announce her decision and told to prepare for a potential public response. Freitas and Schreeder said that deputies and officers were prepared to make sure demonstrators are safe and peaceful. “We will defend people's right to assemble, and arrest anyone who commits acts of vandalism and violence,” Freitas said. Local political leaders, including Santa Rosa Mayor Scott Bartley, urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. Ravitch said the community would never again be the same. “The events of Oct. 22, 2013, are absolutely tragic,” Ravitch said. “A 13-year-old boy was killed by an experienced law enforcement officer. The loss of this young life under these circumstances is a loss for all of us. This community will be forever changed by what happened that afternoon.” View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 \n \n No criminal charges will be filed against a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy who shot and killed 13-year-old Andy Lopez last year as the boy walked down the street carrying an airsoft BB gun that resembled an AK-47 rifle, District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced Monday.

He has certainly grieved for the Lopez family,” Leoni said. “It hasn't been easy for him in terms of the media and public scrutiny but also for the loss of this child.” Leoni said that she and her client had been “in the dark” throughout much of the investigation, although they cooperated by providing statements and information when needed. “You're always concerned whether the charging agency or District Attorney's Office is going to make the right choice, look at the law, apply the facts of the law,” Leoni said. “There's always a concern that they will be swayed by the political aspects or mob mentality. We are glad the District Attorney's Office took (its) time.” Santa Rosa Police Chief Hank Schreeder said that his officers didn't recommend an outcome when they handed their investigation to the District Attorney's Office on Jan. 29. “The District Attorney has to decide on the points of law. We are just the fact finders,” Schreeder said. Ravitch, who has faced criticism over the length of her inquiry, called her review of the police investigation into the shooting “exhaustive and thorough,” resulting in reports that totaled more than 1,000 pages. District Attorney investigators responded to the scene Oct. 22 and worked alongside Santa Rosa police called in to investigate, with assistance from Petaluma police. Ravitch said she assigned an attorney and an investigator who both have significant homicide experience to conduct her office's review and ensure any additional investigative steps took place. She said she chose people who don't have longstanding ties to Sonoma County law enforcement to ensure neutrality. The bulk of their work began after receiving the Santa Rosa Police Department's report on the shooting. That report included interviews with about 200 witnesses, 200 hours of recorded interviews and 175 items of evidence, among other materials, Ravitch told reporters at the press conference Monday. The investigative team re-interviewed witnesses and spoke with a pathologist hired by the Lopez family who conducted an additional autopsy. They also consulted with numerous outside sources, including people with expertise in how people perform in high-stress encounters, and an weapons expert who estimated it would take two seconds to fire eight rounds with the type of gun Gelhaus used. The office even hired a company to do a 3D analysis of the trajectory of the eight shots Gelhaus fired. It concluded that the first shot likely missed Lopez, hitting a home behind him. The next one likely struck him in the upper left arm as he was “directly facing” the deputy, the report found. The remaining six shots probably hit him as he was turning, falling down or had hit the ground, the report found. A total of 19 seconds elapsed from the time of the initial call for backup to the time “shots fired” was first reported to dispatchers, Ravitch said. Schemmel, a trainee who was at the wheel of the patrol car, was still getting into a defensive position when Gelhaus fired his weapon from behind an open passenger-side door, the report stated. Ravitch said she released a synopsis of the shooting inquiry to address public concerns about transparency. She described her investigation as a limited inquiry into criminal liability of the deputy. “Police tactics, training, and civil liability are not matters to be addressed by our office or this report,” she said. The Sonoma County Grand Jury will receive the district attorney's full report and all exhibits, as well as the Santa Rosa Police Department's investigative reports. A copy of the report will also be sent to U.S. Department of Justice representatives at the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office which are involved in a federal civil rights review. The state Attorney General's Office declined to review the report because it found no conflict or other cause that called for an independent review, Ravitch said. Ravitch said she is aware the decision will not alleviate the pain felt by the Lopez family and others in the community. “It is incumbent upon us to move forward to address the many layers of concern uncovered by this tragedy, and work together to rebuild trust and support for all members of this community,” she said in a statement. In a statement expressing sympathy for the Lopez family and friends and others involved in the incident, Freitas suggested one way the community could come together was to support legislation requiring imitation firearms such as the one Lopez was carrying be made of either brightly colored or translucent materials. California Senate Bill 199, co-authored by state Sen. Noreen Evans, D-Santa Rosa, would expand the federal law that requires imitation firearms be sold with an orange tip, a feature that had been removed from the gun Lopez was carrying when he was shot. A section of the gun Lopez was carrying was made with translucent plastic, but the difference is difficult to notice at a distance. The new law would require enough translucent material to allow “unmistakable observation of the device's complete contents,” Freitas said. The sheriff said a review of deputy-involved shootings over the past 10 years — something he said he ordered in March 2013, before Lopez was shot — should be completed and made public by the end of the year. “Going forward, I am hopeful that through meaningful collaborative effort, we can assemble the building blocks of prevention, improved communication, and community trust and confidence in the Sheriff's Office and our staff,” he said. On Monday, local law enforcement agencies were alerted that Ravitch was planning to announce her decision and told to prepare for a potential public response. Freitas and Schreeder said that deputies and officers were prepared to make sure demonstrators are safe and peaceful. “We will defend people's right to assemble, and arrest anyone who commits acts of vandalism and violence,” Freitas said. Local political leaders, including Santa Rosa Mayor Scott Bartley, urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. Ravitch said the community would never again be the same. “The events of Oct. 22, 2013, are absolutely tragic,” Ravitch said. “A 13-year-old boy was killed by an experienced law enforcement officer. The loss of this young life under these circumstances is a loss for all of us. This community will be forever changed by what happened that afternoon.” 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 \n \n Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. \n \n Disqus""]",2,"– A sheriff's deputy who gunned down a 13-year-old carrying a BB gun in Northern California last year won't face criminal charges, but still has a civil suit coming down the pike, the Press Democrat reports. Deputy Erick Gelhaus ""fired his weapon in response to what he honestly and reasonably believed was an imminent threat of death,"" said Sonoma County DA Jill Ravitch of Andy Lopez's death. ""As such, he was lawfully acting in defense of himself or others."" The finding followed a five-month investigation and protests around California, including a ""National Day of Action for Andy Lopez"" organized by a statewide group opposing police brutality, CBS San Francisco reports. Andy was walking through rural Sonoma County last October, holding a BB gun resembling an AK-47, when deputies on patrol saw him and told him to drop the weapon. Ten seconds later, Gelhaus had put seven bullets in the boy. ""The family and my office are greatly disappointed with the decision,"" said the Lopez family's attorney. ""If there was ever a case where charges were warranted, it was this one."" But Ravitch said her office pored over more than 1,000 pages of reports and spoke to numerous experts to consider ""every interpretation of the facts."" Now the Lopez family's civil suit, held up by the criminal probe, will ""have to run through the legal process,"" an official said.

Kyle Navin is listed as the general manager of the family\'s refuse company. \n \n Sources said evidence found in the couple\'s abandoned pickup truck that has since been sent to the state forensic laboratory for analysis led investigators to ramp up the investigation, with as many as a half-dozen detectives working on it. \n \n The state police are poring through a ton of paperwork trying to backtrack where the Navins may have been before they disappeared. — Easton Police Chief Timothy Shaw \n \n The couple\'s truck was found Aug. 9 in a commuter parking lot off exit 42 of the Merritt Parkway, on the border of Weston and Westport. Until recently, the Navins lived in Weston. Their family-owned garbage company, J&J Refuse, operates in Westport. \n \n Jeffrey Navin, 56, was last seen at work Aug. 4. Police have not said when anyone last had contact with Jeanette Navin, 55. \n \n ""The state police are poring through a ton of paperwork trying to backtrack where the Navins may have been before they disappeared,"" Easton Police Chief Timothy Shaw said. \n \n Sources said investigators are reviewing bank records, credit card purchases and cellphone records, as well as talking to the couple\'s friends and coworkers. It is unclear if their cellphones have been found. \n \n ""We are looking at everything, nothing is being ruled out,"" Shaw said this week. Investigators from Easton are assisting the state police. \n \n Police initially suspected the Navins, who liked to take spur-of-the-moment vacations, had gone away without telling anyone. But as time passed, police said they began to suspect the two either willingly disappeared or were victims of foul play. \n \n A review of public records shows the Navins had spent part of the past few months downsizing and paying off old debts. \n \n On May 28, Jeanette Navin sold the family\'s longtime home on Osborn Farm Road in Weston for $900,000, records show. The couple moved to a rental home in Easton, where they were living at the time of their disappearance. Police have searched the home for evidence. \n \n The Navins had owned the Weston property since 1994 when Jeanette Navin purchased it for $135,000. Over the years they had made several improvements to the home, including spending more than $25,000 to install an in-ground swimming pool, according to Weston town records. \n \n In June, three old mortgages and home equity loans that Jeanette Navin had taken out on the Osborn Farm Road home were released. More than $780,000 in mortgages held by People\'s Bank and JPMorgan Chase bank were released between June 9 and June 26, records show. \n \n Jeffrey Navin is not listed on any of the legal documents for the Weston home. \n \n Jeffrey Navin was involved in a legal battle over a $1.4 million home that he owns in Guilford that was originally built by Colleen McCullough, the author of the best-selling book ""The Thorn Birds,"" as a retreat. Court records show that Navin has been involved in a long-running foreclosure battle over a Guilford house at 7 Hart Landing Road. \n \n HSBC Bank USA filed a foreclosure against Navin in 2007, alleging that he had failed to pay any of a $1.3 million mortgage on 7 Hart Landing Road. Navin has appealed the judgment against him twice but lost both times. \n \n The case is still pending in New Haven court eight years after it was filed. A judge denied Navin\'s latest attempt to reopen the case in late July, court records show. The debt that Navin owes has grown to $2.2 million as of the end of 2014, according to court records. \n \n Connecticut Light & Power, now called Eversource, also took Navin to court last year, claiming he owed about $130,600 for electrical service for the Hart Landing Road house. In November, Navin was ordered to pay $138,137.79 in $35 weekly payments, plus interest. Navin, who disputed the amount owed, appealed. \n \n The Guilford house was listed for sale at a price of $1.4 million by the Settlers & Traders Real Estate Co. in Westport. But the listing agent, Michael Calise, said Wednesday that the house is no longer on the market. He said a third party recently told him to take it off the market. He declined to comment further. \n \n Jeffrey Navin has operated J&J Refuse Inc. in Westport since the mid-1980s. The company\'s website was taken off-line in the days after it became public that the couple was missing, but has recently gone back online, and the couple\'s son, Kyle Navin, is listed as the operations manager. \n \n Jeanette Navin has worked in the Weston school district since 1996. She is a paraprofessional assigned to the Weston Intermediate School library. School officials said that since word of her disappearance became public, concerned parents have been calling. \n \n ""Jeanette is a beloved member of our school community,"" Weston Superintendent Colleen Palmer said in a statement. \n \n ""Our entire district is extremely concerned that she and her husband have not yet been located, and we continue to offer our support in any way that would further the efforts of law enforcement to find them and bring them home safely.""']",2,"– When it comes to rules about posts on Facebook, there's a fair bit of subtlety.

(Photo: WXIA-TV, Atlanta) \n \n JONESBORO, Ga. — It was just past midnight Saturday when Clayton County Police Sgt. Joanne Southerland pulled back a piece of wood from the back of a linen closet and uncovered a hidden space between the garage and the attic. Inside, 13-year-old Gregory Jean Jr. huddled. \n \n ""We told him who we were, we told him we were there to help him,"" Southerland said. ""When we finally got him calmed down he said, \'Thank you. Thank you.\' "" \n \n Clayton County Police held a news conference Monday to answer questions about the case that\'s drawn intense national attention. \n \n Police Chief Gregory Porter left many of the specifics unanswered, repeatedly saying he didn\'t want to damage the case against Gregory Jean Sr. and Samantha Joy Davis. Three teenagers, children of Davis, also were arrested early Saturday morning. \n \n They face charges of false imprisonment, cruelty to children and obstruction of an officer, Porter said. \n \n ""The investigation is ongoing,"" said Porter. \n \n “We weren\'t going to leave until we found him.” Sgt. Joanne Southerland, Clayton County (Ga.) Police Department \n \n Police had received information that the child did not want to be there and had been physically abused. \n \n Porter, Southerland and Officer Daniel Day focused on how they found Gregory. The boy\'s birth mother called 911 and told them her son was being held at the home against his will. When police went to investigate, his father and stepmother said they didn\'t know the child, and didn\'t know why police were coming to their home. They granted police access to search the home. Police found nothing. \n \n Gregory was able to reach his mother again through a MagicJack app. She, again, called 911. When Southerland, who worked several years in the Crimes Against Children Unit, heard the specifics of that 911 call, she insisted they return to the house. \n \n ""We weren\'t going to leave until we found him,"" she said. \n \n After police left following the first visit, the incident report says the boy ""was thrown down the stairs and punched several times ... (causing) bleeding and lacerations around his mouth."" The report says the boy was assaulted by a juvenile in the house at the direction of the boy\'s father, apparently in retribution for contacting his mother. \n \n Thirty minutes later, using more specific information the boy was able to pass to his mother, they finally found the hidden compartment. The space included just wooden beams and insulation. \n \n ""A space where no person should be living,"" Porter said. He wouldn\'t go into specifics about how long and how often the boy was kept there, but there was a bedroom he shared at the home with the other children. \n \n Porter wouldn\'t answer specific questions about why the mother had not contacted police earlier, calling it a ""unique case."" He did confirm Gregory was not officially listed as missing with any police agency. \n \n On Sunday, a judge denied bond for Jean, 37, and Davis, 42. Davis is on probation for child cruelty. She\'s also accused of striking the boy with a stick across the back of his legs, back and buttocks. \n \n ""It concerns me as a police officer and a father,"" Porter said. \n \n Court records show in 2004, Davis heated a pair of scissors on the stove and used them to burn her 6-year-old son on his neck and hand, before cutting off a piece of his tongue. She was ordered in 2006 to 10 years probation and anger management classes. \n \n Police won\'t say whether the child at the center of that case was one of the three teenagers arrested at the house, but officers say they are all Davis\' children. \n \n Police say the 13-year-old found had been abused that night by both Davis and one of her children and he told police he had been physically punished in the past for trying to leave. \n \n The missing boy\'s mother, Lisa Smith, says she did not know exactly where her son was located, and neither did the court in Allen County, Ind. The couple are defendants in a small claims case seeking $4,417 in unpaid rent.

She told police her son was being abused at a home in Jonesboro and was being hidden in a garage. Porter said the boy\'s mother told police he had been missing for four years, and she had been trying to reunite with him during that time. \n \n Those details and others in the case emerged during a press conference at Clayton County Police headquarters. Police declined to say whose phone the boy used, how he knew to contact his mother or which parent had legal custody of the boy. Porter said he didn\'t want to compromise the investigation. \n \n Two officers who responded initially couldn\'t find the boy after searching and shouting out for him inside the garage. They left, but were told to go back by a supervisor, Porter said. \n \n As police resumed their search shortly after midnight, the boy used an app to send his mother text messages, including a photo of the home\'s garage according to the initial police report. She then passed those updates to police, who continued questioning the other residents of the house and searching. \n \n The boy\'s stepmother eventually directed officers to a closet on the home\'s third floor, according to the report, where Sgt.

Southerland said she helped him out of the concealed compartment and calmed him down. She said the space where the boy had been hidden was bounded by the home\'s exterior siding, and he was enclosed within the wooden frame of the house and garage. \n \n The boy then thanked officers for helping him, and later posed for photos with police while smiling widely. \n \n The boy\'s 37-year-old birth father and 42-year-old stepmother face charges of false imprisonment, cruelty to children and obstruction.

Porter said police have not found the boy was enrolled in public schools. It was not clear whether the mother had previously reported her son missing. Porter said he did not appear to be listed on any registries of missing children. \n \n Julie Pizarro, who lives nearby, said the boy seemed quiet but she never thought anything was wrong.

Koester said she’s met with her sister, but she declined to provide details about her condition. \n \n The sheriff said police are looking for two Hispanic women driving a dark-colored SUV in connection with the abduction, based on Papini’s description. Authorities have no other information about the captors, including other details of their appearance or clothing. \n \n On Friday, Koester expressed gratitude to investigators, search teams and media outlets for keeping Papini’s story alive. Koester said she’s hopeful her sister’s abductors will be found. \n \n She also thanked the motorist, who hasn’t yet been identified by detectives, who stopped for Papini on the side of the road. \n \n “We appreciate that person stopping and helping her,” she said. \n \n One woman posted on social media after Papini was found to say she saw her on the side of the road and called 911, but didn’t stop. \n \n “I couldn’t stop in time to help you this morning but I did pull over and report to police that I saw you by the road and was certain you needed help,” said Alison Sutton, who posted on a Facebook page dedicated to finding Papini. “I am thankful that someone else was able to pull over safely to help you and that you are safe. God bless you and your family.” \n \n “Thank you very much for alerting the police,” replied Rod Rodriguez III, who says he’s Sherri’s father-in-law. “We greatly appreciate your assistance.” \n \n “I don’t know that my call helped her,” she wrote in a follow-up post. “I am very thankful she is safe and back with her family. This is truly a Thanksgiving to remember.” \n \n Rodriguez didn’t returned a phone message left Friday at his home near Redding. Sutton couldn’t be reached for comment. \n \n The Sacramento Bee on Friday morning requested 911 tapes and dispatch logs from the California Highway Patrol and the Yolo County Sheriff’s Office, but the agencies haven’t provided them. \n \n Bosenko, meanwhile, appeared Friday on “Good Morning America,” but he didn’t offer new details about the case. Like Koester, he said Papini was overjoyed to be reunited with her family. “Of course, she was very emotional to be released and hear her husband’s voice and then a few hours later to be reunited with him,” he told the news program. \n \n With little new information being released Friday, various online sleuths have been trying to find out what might have motivated two women to abduct Papini and then let her go. \n \n Before Papini reappeared, investigators said they had spoken with her friends and acquaintances, as well as “people Sherri has had past relationships with” to try to find her. Investigators said they had gone out of state tracking down leads. \n \n Detectives have authored close to 20 search warrants – some of which are sealed – and they said they’re examining cellphone records, bank accounts, email and social media profiles. Investigators have declined to discuss what prompted them to file the search warrants or why detectives have traveled out of state. Bosenko said Friday he had no new information to release.']",4,"– ""Thank you. Thank you."" Those were the first words Gregory Jean Jr. spoke to police on Saturday when they peeled back a wood panel in an upstairs closet and found him crammed in the space between the garage and attic, WXIA reports. But the officers had help from Gregory himself, because it was the texts and photos he sent to his mom that helped police track down where the missing 13-year-old was hidden in his father and stepmother's house, the AP reports. And although Gregory Jean Sr., 37, and Samantha Joy Davis, 42, didn't bar police from searching the home, ""there was a lot of deception,"" Clayton County Police Sgt. Joanne Southerland told reporters, as per CNN. In fact, the first officers on the scene—sent after a 911 call from the boy's mother—came up empty-handed and left after Jean and Davis said they knew nothing. After the police left, young Gregory contacted his mom again through the magicJack app and she redialed 911; when Southerland, who had worked in a Crimes Against Children unit for several years, heard that call, she made police go back and search again. ""We weren't going to leave until we found him,"" she tells WXIA. The space Gregory was crammed into had nothing but wooden beams and insulation—""a space where no person should be living,"" the local police chief told reporters. The next court appearance for Jean and Davis, who have been charged with false imprisonment, child cruelty, and obstruction of justice, is scheduled for Dec. 9, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. (A girl missing for 12 years was recently found in Mexico.)"

(Associated Press) \n \n Mourdock, who\'s been locked in one of the country\'s most watched Senate races, was asked during the final minutes of a debate with Democratic challenger Rep. Joe Donnelly whether abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest. \n \n ""I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God. And, I think, even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,"" Mourdock said. \n \n Mourdock became the second GOP Senate candidate to find himself on the defensive over comments about rape and pregnancy. Missouri Senate candidate Rep. Todd Akin said during a television interview in August that women\'s bodies have ways of preventing pregnancy in cases of what he called ""legitimate rape."" Since his comment, Akin has repeatedly apologized but has refused to leave his race despite calls to do so by leaders of his own party, from GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney on down. \n \n It was not immediately clear what effect Mourdock\'s comments might have during the final two weeks before the Nov. 6 election. But they could prove problematic. Romney distanced himself from Mourdock on Tuesday night _ a day after a television ad featuring the former Massachusetts governor supporting the GOP Senate candidate began airing in Indiana. \n \n ""Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock\'s comments, and they do not reflect his views,"" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in an email to The Associated Press. Romney aides would not say whether the ad would be pulled and if the Republican presidential nominee would continue to support Mourdock\'s Senate bid. \n \n Other Republicans did not immediately weigh in. Indiana Republican Party spokesman Pete Seat referred comment to the Mourdock campaign. A spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a spokeswoman for Romney did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday night. \n \n National Democrats quickly picked up on Mourdock\'s statement and used it as an opportunity to paint him as an extreme candidate, calling him a tea party ""zealot."" DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz described Mourdock\'s comments as ""outrageous and demeaning to woman"" and called on Romney to take his pro-Mourdock ad off the air. \n \n Later Tuesday after the debate, Mourdock further explained he did not believe God intended the rape, but that God is the only one who can create life. \n \n ""Are you trying to suggest somehow that God preordained rape, no I don\'t think that,"" said Mourdock. ""Anyone who would suggest that is just sick and twisted. No, that\'s not even close to what I said."" \n \n In response, Donnelly said after the debate in southern Indiana that he doesn\'t believe ""my God, or any God, would intend that to happen."" \n \n Along with Romney\'s ad, top Republicans have been flocking to Indiana as part of an effort to break open the high-stakes race for the Senate seat, currently held by veteran GOP Sen. Richard Lugar who was defeated by Mourdock in the May primary. Republicans need to gain three seats, or four if President Barack Obama wins re-election, and seats that were predicted to remain or turn Republican have grown uncertain. \n \n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell came to Indianapolis for a fundraiser Monday, and Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham campaigned for Mourdock last week. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte is due in the state Wednesday. \n \n Romney\'s coattails carry special significance in deeply conservative Indiana, where Mourdock has underperformed Romney by 12 points in most public polls. Karl Rove\'s Crossroads GPS also has bought another $1 million of airtime in Indiana, making his group the biggest player in Indiana\'s Senate race. A message left for Crossroads GPS spokesman Nate Hodson was not immediately returned.', 'In a Tuesday night debate with his Democratic rival and a Libertarian candidate for one of Indiana\'s U.S. Senate seats, Republican candidate Richard Mourdock suggested that pregnancies resulting from rape are ""something that God intended to happen,"" despite the ""horrible situation"" from which they derived. \n \n Mourdock, a Tea Party-backed candidate who beat longtime moderate Senator Richard Lugar in the state\'s Republican nominating contest earlier this year, expressed his view that ""life begins at conception"" and that he would only allow abortions in circumstances in which the mother\'s life was in danger. \n \n ""I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is that gift from God,"" Mourdock said. ""And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."" \n \n Democrats immediately pounced on his comments, and Donnelly -- who is also pro-life but who supports exceptions for rape and incest -- released a statement questioning the notion that God would ""intend for rape to happen."" \n \n ""The God I believe in and the God I know most Hoosiers believe in, does not intend for rape to happen -- ever,"" Donnelly said. ""What Mr. Mourdock said is shocking, and it is stunning that he would be so disrespectful to survivors of rape."" \n \n Mourdock, seeking to clarify his comments in a press conference following the debate, said he had intended to say that ""God creates life,"" and that any interpretation of his comments to mean God ""pre-ordained rape"" were ""sick"" and ""twisted."" \n \n ""What I said was, in answering the question form my position of faith, I said I believe that God creates life. I believe that as wholly and as fully as I can believe it. That God creates life,"" Mourdock said. ""Are you trying to suggest that somehow I think that God pre-ordained rape? No, I don\'t think that. That\'s sick. Twisted. That\'s not even close to what I said. What I said is that God creates life."" \n \n While to the right on Lugar with regard to issues relating both to reproductive rights and others, Mourdock\'s stance on abortion is hardly an anomaly in the Republican party. His comments echo similar remarks made by former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a staunch pro-life social conservative, while he was still in the midst of a bid for the White House. \n \n ""I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created -- in the sense of rape -- but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you,"" Santorum told CNN\'s Piers Morgan in January. ""We have to make the best of a bad situation."" \n \n At the GOP convention in Tampa this year, the party approved a platform with language calling for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. The language, which is the same as in the party\'s 2004 and 2008 platform, did not provide exceptions for victims of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother. \n \n Mourdock isn\'t the first Republican Senate candidate this cycle to inspire headlines about comments relating to rape and abortion. Todd Akin, Missouri\'s embattled Republican Senate candidate, was rebuked even by his own party when he suggested that pregnancies resulting from what he called ""legitimate rape"" were ""really rare."" \n \n Akin\'s comments were roundly decried by Democrats and Republicans alike, and a spokesperson for the Romney campaign said that Romney and Ryan ""disagree"" with Akin\'s statement. \n \n Romney, who has endorsed Mourdock, recently appeared in a campaign video on behalf of Mourdock, and campaigned with him in Evansville, Indiana, on Aug. 4. Paul Ryan, who, like Mourdock, opposes all abortions except to save the life of the mother, appeared at an open press funder with him on Sept. 17. Romney opposes abortion with exceptions for the victims of rape and incest and if the life of the mother is at risk. \n \n In a statement released Tuesday night, Romney spokesperson Andrea Saul said Mourdock\'s remarks were not in line with Romney\'s views. \n \n ""Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock\'s comments, and they do not reflect his views,"" Saul said.']",2,"– The GOP is on damage control duty after controversial comments on rape from another one of its candidates.

199,"['Investigators checked a trash can at Boston Common following the stabbing of two park rangers. \n \n A homeless man with a “violent criminal past” allegedly stabbed two Boston park rangers who approached him on Boston Common Tuesday, lunging at them in an unprovoked and wild attack that left one ranger in critical condition at Massachusetts General Hospital, police officials said. \n \n Boston police chased Bodio Hutchinson, 34, into the Public Garden, where they arrested him and fished a knife out of a nearby pond, officials said. Before officers tackled him to the pavement, witnesses said, Hutchinson told the officers to shoot him. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “Our prayers are with both of the rangers,” said Boston Police Commissioner William Evans at a press conference Tuesday night. “We have good witnesses and good video, and we’re confident in the suspect we have that’s responsible for this.” \n \n Authorities did not name the two men wounded but said the ranger who was critically hurt and taken to Mass. General is a 46-year-old sergeant who has been on the job for 20 years. He was stabbed in the abdomen and was in surgery on Tuesday night. The other ranger, authorities said, is 23 and had just joined the force. He suffered several wounds and was taken to Tufts Medical Center. \n \n Hutchinson was sitting on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument statue in the Common when the rangers, who were not armed, approached him, said Evans. \n \n Hutchinson “has a very violent, assaultive past history,” Evans said. “The officers confronted him up by the monument and without provocation he lunged at both officers,” \n \n Witnesses who rushed to the Common after hearing a commotion described a horrifying scene: two wounded rangers, one lying on a bench with his hands over his stomach to stanch the bleeding, the other walking nearby and holding his arm. \n \n Bill Mitchell for The Boston Globe Boston Police chased Bodio Hutchinson, 34, into the Public Garden, where they arrested him and fished a knife out of a nearby pond, officials said. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “We run up here, we see cops, just like, bleeding,” said Jackson Marchant, who was walking nearby when the stabbing occurred. “A lot of people were helping the cops. But he was stabbed right in the central stomach, and it was bloody, it was bleeding, his whole torso was covered in red. He was holding himself, praying.” \n \n The wounded ranger continued praying as he was loaded into an emergency vehicle, Marchant said. \n \n Officials said that as Hutchinson allegedly fled, some bystanders followed him, and videotaped him on their cellphones. \n \n Witnesses described a brief chase, with officers running after Hutchinson out of the Common and into the Public Garden, telling him to stop. Hutchinson was not moving very fast, witnesses said. \n \n “He stopped, and he told them to shoot him,” said Nicholas Rusk, 19. “They just tackled him to the ground.” \n \n One witness snapped a series of pictures of the arrest: In one, a heavyset man dressed in a Red Sox jacket and a pompom hat with “Boston” written on it is lying prone on the ground under two officers, his mouth slightly open. In another, the man stands in bright red shorts over black pants, surrounded by officers whom he appears to be addressing. Police declined to confirm that the pictures showed Hutchinson. \n \n Witnesses pointed police to the pond in the Public Garden, and officers waded in. Evans said they retrieved a knife. \n \n “I can’t say enough about the public,” said Evans. “Great work on the part of the public and on the part of the officers.” \n \n According to police, Hutchinson has an open warrant for his arrest on a charge of assault and battery on a police officer. He was arrested in February of last year and charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery, according to officials. \n \n Evans said it was not clear whether the rangers who approached Hutchinson knew of the outstanding warrant. \n \n Mayor Martin J. Walsh said that at any given time, two to four officers are patroling Boston Common and the Public Garden. \n \n “Certainly we’ve, on the Boston Common, had issues in the past with homelessness, but our officers work very hard in there,” said Walsh. “Generally they work without incident and are able to defuse any situation. In this incident clearly they were not able to defuse it when the gentleman attacked them.” \n \n Walsh said the parks commissioner will talk with rangers and police to see if they need more equipment or more manpower to keep the parks safe. \n \n On Tuesday evening, the monument was roped off with crime scene tape. The heavy police presence had drawn onlookers, many of whom expressed shock that rangers could be so brazenly attacked. Helicopters whirred overhead, and investigators canvassed the scene by flashlight, marking several spots as evidence. \n \n Evans said Hutchinson will probably face at least two counts of attempted murder, in addition to the outstanding charges of assaulting a police officer, and drug charges. \n \n “He’s not a newcomer to the criminal justice system,” said Evans.', 'A week after the Newtown massacre, The Journal News published an interactive Google Map with the names and addresses of gun permit owners in select New York cities. The bold move has escalated into a transparency arms race, after a Connecticut lawyer posted the phone number and addresses of the Journal‘s staff, including a Google Maps satellite Image of the Publisher’s home. “I don’t know whether the Journal’s publisher Janet Hasson is a permit holder herself, but here’s how to find her to ask,” read Christopher Fountain’s blog post. The double irony here is that open data was heralded as a tool of enlightened civic dialog, and has been co-opted for fierce partisanship, bordering on public endangerment. \n \n The Journal‘s original publication of the map sparked nationwide outrage and thousands of angry comments. Gun permit holding is public information in New York, and can be acquired through a mere request via the Freedom of Information Act. But, coming on the heels of the Newtown shooting, the publication had a clear provocative intent. “New York residents have the right to own guns with a permit and they also have a right to access public information,” said a defiant Hasson. \n \n Given that the Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle used in the school shooting was reportedly legally registered with the killer’s mother, the Google Map sparked a debate about whether gun owners should be labeled like other potential menaces to society, “The implications are mind-boggling,” said Marine Scott F. Williams to The Journal News, “It’s as if gun owners are sex offenders (and) to own a handgun risks exposure as if one is a sex offender. It’s, in my mind, crazy.” \n \n Blogger Christopher Fountain took the debate into his own hands, publishing the personal information of The Journals‘ staff. “Hundreds of thousands of readers; Janet, you have a great Christmas Eve,” he wrote, after a popular political outlet, Instapundit, linked to his post. \n \n Ironically, the promise of open data was supposed to lead to open-minded discussion. “If the broad light of day could be let in upon men’s actions, it would purify them as the sun disinfects,” reads the often-cited quote from Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who stands a champion to modern-day nonprofits fighting for greater access to health, legislative, and administrative government data. \n \n Open data advocates have struggled to get media attention for their utopian vision of automated government services. This latest use of open data via Google Maps, both to publish gun permit ownership and journalists’ geolocation data, seems to have hit the media sweet spot, as it plays into our debased partisan interests. It appears that transparency lends itself equally to being both a tool of democracy or a partisan weapon.']",2,"– Another bodybuilder has suffered an untimely death, just days after Dallas McCarver apparently choked to death at 26.

200,"['It focuses on a notorious act of white police brutality against mostly Black citizens, in a July 1967, siege at the Motor City’s Algiers Motel, where racism met frustration and blood was wantonly shed. Three young Black men were left dead and many questions were left unanswered. The mostly white Detroit Police Department emerged officially exonerated but not blameless. \n \n The incident is set against the larger story of the Detroit riots of the same year, which left 43 people dead, nearly 1,200 injured and 7,200 arrested, as the National Guard along with city and state police combined to enforce law and order in a city literally burning from racial tensions. \n \n No one would accuse the cops in Detroit of being “too nice,” although Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal — who previously teamed for Zero Dark Thirty and Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker — are careful not to demonize every authority figure. Many of the police and soldiers in the film are appalled by the acts of racism and violence they’re witnessing, among them the commanding officer of trigger-happy young patrol officer Philip Krauss, who is played by cherry-cheeked Will Poulter (The Revenant). \n \n Despite civil-rights advances and eight years of an African-American U.S. president, the colour of a person’s skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police — who were recently encouraged by President Donald Trump to “please don’t be too nice” when dealing with crime suspects, wink, wink. \n \n The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on, making Detroit urgent viewing regardless of its character-development flaws. \n \n Being appalled, however, isn’t the same as taking full ownership. The commander severely reprimands Krauss for fatally shooting a fleeing looter. He then allows the unrepentant patrolman to return to the streets. \n \n Krauss later becomes the central antagonist of the Algiers Motel siege, which is sparked by a teen’s reckless firing of a starter’s pistol at a passing group of National Guardsmen. As cops and soldiers converge on the seedy establishment, seeking the sniper they believe hides inside, fate has also drawn in multiple unlucky bystanders, who thought they’d escaped the riots. \n \n Among them are rising R&B singer Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend Fred Simple (Jacob Latimore); private security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega); a Vietnam vet named Greene (Anthony Mackie); and two white visitors from Ohio (Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever), who picked a bad time and place to party. \n \n That’s a lot of characters, and there are more, and here you have the central deficiency of Boal’s script: it tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people. The film is less a character study and more of a situational one; a post-script notes that the Algiers Motel incident has never been fully explained. \n \n Detroit opens with a roughly animated history lesson about how poor southern Blacks moved to white-dominated northern cities while affluent whites fled to the suburbs, taking the best jobs with them. The resulting powder keg of inequities exploded not just in Detroit, but across America. \n \n And it led to situations like the motel standoff, which Bigelow and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd powerfully depict cinéma vérité style as a cascading series of bad choices, evil intentions and escalating violence. \n \n Krauss and his fellow racist cops torture the rounded-up motel guests by beating them and threatening to shoot them one by one until the identity of the alleged sniper is disclosed. \n \n Watching it unfold over the bulk of the film’s 143-minute running time makes for a grim sit, made all the more so by James Newton Howard’s minimalist score, which at times disappears altogether. Bigelow deserves credit for not trivializing the drama with a soundtrack packed with driving Motown tunes, although a version of Martha and the Vandellas’ “Nowhere To Run” is briefly heard in the film at one point. \n \n You don’t need a big backbeat to drive images like these home; Detroit’s deep fury and essential message sears the eye and brain.', 'There is no nice or pretty way to tell a story about the systemic oppression and mistreatment of black people in the United States. It\'s fitting then that Kathryn Bigelow\'s "" Detroit ,"" an account of the murders of three unarmed black men that took place in the Algiers Motel in late July 1967, is neither — it is an all-out assault on your senses and soul. \n \n It\'s hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is. ""Detroit"" is a well-made and evocative film that is also numbingly brutal with little to no reprieve. And while it might be the only true way to tell this story, it\'s also one that is not going to be for everyone. The stomach-churning horror begins immediately and does not let up for 2 hours and 23 minutes. \n \n To set the stage for the Algiers Motel, Bigelow begins by speeding through the history of black people in United States with animated acrylics and pounding music — emancipation, the great migration, white flight and the racist zoning practices that led to the overcrowding of black residents in urban pockets. Tensions have already reached a tipping point, and then in the summer of 1967, Detroit police bust an after-hours club in what would become the inciting incident for the riots. \n \n Three days after the riots begin, a local singing group called The Dramatics are about to go on stage at a big, crowded theater hoping to get their big break, but are interrupted and sent home due to the events outside. The men exit the theater in their sparkly suits into what looks like a war zone. As they run through the streets they assure every cop who isn\'t already beating someone with a night stick that they\'re just on their way home. Bigelow shows all of this with handheld, ground level docudrama realism. There is no orienting yourself to the bigger picture, only what is right in front of you. \n \n The charismatic lead singer Larry (Algee Smith) and his buddy Fred (Jacob Latimore) decide to peel off and get an $11 room at the Algiers and wait out the night. There they meet two white party girls, a veteran, Greene (a terrific Anthony Mackie), and a provocateur, Carl (Jason Mitchell), who plays around with a starter pistol that eventually catches the attention of the police in the area. The officers, who we\'ve already learned are rotten, storm the motel on the hunt for the sniper they presume is there. \n \n The local police, led by a maniacal, hotheaded racist, Krauss (played by the English actor Will Poulter), kills Carl immediately and then continue to terrorize the guests relentlessly with inhuman torture tactics in what seems like an endless sequence of horror upon horror until two more end up dead and they call it a night. \n \n Bigelow collaborated again with screenwriter Mark Boal on ""Detroit,"" which is perfectly evocative of this specific time and place, but lacking the perspective and illumination that one might hope a 50-year-old event would warrant. Perhaps they wanted to leave conclusions and interpreting to the audience, and as the film notes at the end, no one knows for certain what happened in the Algiers Motel and some of the scenes were pieced together and imagined by the filmmakers. \n \n There is some nuance — in the National Guard officer who is horrified by the situation and the local security officer (John Boyega) who only wanted to ease tensions — but not nearly as much as Bigelow and Boal have previously achieved in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker."" \n \n Also very little insight is given to the victims\' lives outside of this event. Maybe that\'s not the point, though. Maybe anger is all you\'re supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with ""Detroit"" is the point. \n \n This was America, you think. This is still America. And the movies can\'t offer a resolution that history hasn\'t. \n \n ""Detroit,"" an Annapurna Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""strong violence and pervasive language.""

Inspired in part by the 1992 Los Angeles riots — which were sparked by the acquittal of the LAPD officers who\'d beaten Rodney King near to death — the movie\'s plot involved the murder of black hip-hop artist ""Jeriko One"" by a pair of white Los Angeles cops. \n \n As ambitious as it was unwieldy, Strange Days flopped so hard that Bigelow\'s career took years to recover. But she landed on her feet, becoming the first and so far only woman to win the Academy Award for best director, for the Iraq war movie The Hurt Locker, which also won best picture. Her follow-up, Zero Dark Thirty, got a Best Picture nod, too. And that\'s how a sexagenarian woman in Hollywood earns the juice to make a movie like the incendiary new Detroit — Bigelow\'s vivid, inevitably divisive reenactment of a real 1967 incident wherein three Motor City police officers were charged in the killings of three adolescent black men while the city was under martial law following riots. \n \n Seemingly in a position to make any movie she wanted, she chose a lightly fictionalized historical drama that bares a striking resemblance to her little-seen Angela Bassett-starring sci-fi flick from 1995. (Strange Days even climaxes in a riot touched off by white police using excessive force on a black suspect, which is where Detroit begins.) \n \n Until now, the highest-profile accounting of what happened that night was John Hersey\'s 1968 book The Algiers Motel Incident. (Hersey\'s estate declined to sell Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal the rights, The New York Times reported.) Detroit isn\'t as dispassionate as that. Just as the movie Hidden Figures buffed and polished the story told in the eponymous nonfiction book for maximum uplift, Detroit heats and sharpens the facts that formed it for maximum outrage. \n \n Not that those facts weren\'t outrageous already: In the case Detroit revisits, the cops were acquitted after the confessions they gave and then recanted were ruled inadmissible in court. That\'s a cruel irony, because it was in their attempt to coerce confessions from the young men they\'d confined in Detroit\'s Algiers Motel — a $6-a-night flophouse that the law considered a den of sin —that those out-of-control cops resorted to intimidation, torture, and finally murder. (The presence of two white girls from Ohio among all those black men appeared to inflame the cops\' further — they accused the women of prostitution, stripping and beating them.) The police claimed a sniper had fired upon them from inside the motel, but they never recovered a rifle from the scene. Detroit subscribes to accounts from several witnesses that the shots that summoned the police came from a starter pistol fired first as a stupid prank, then as an impotent and costly gesture of defiance. Carl Cooper, the 17-year-old who\'d allegedly fired it, was the first to die that night. \n \n One of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution, and who said he was assaulted by the accused policemen himself at the Algiers, was a musician. Singer Larry Reed quit his vocal group The Dramatics after that hellish night in 1967; the group broke out a few years later and had a long career without him. (They\'re still touring.) Reed was one of the incident\'s key figures that frequent Bigelow collaborator Boal interviewed while working on the movie. And though Boal\'s research team included Pulitzer Prize-winning Detroit Free Press reporter David Zeman, he has used his artistic license to plug some gaps in the legal record. (Other limits on the film\'s authenticity were merely budgetary, like the fact that tax incentives resulted in most of Detroit being filmed on location in... Boston.) \n \n Boal\'s script commingles real and fictional people: Real-life witnesses Melvin Dismukes, Julie Hysell, and Larry Reed (played onscreen by John Boyega, Hannah Murray, and Algee Smith, respectively), are represented, but the brutal cops in the movie have different names than the officers who were eventually acquitted of the Algiers Motel killings. Their ringleader is played by Will Poulter, a redheaded, freckled 24-year-old English actor whose permanently right-angled eyebrows make him look like the satanic cousin of MAD magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman. ""We\'ve failed these people,"" he says early in the film, sounding like a peace-loving Hubert Humphrey voter moments before he fatally shoots one of ""these people"" in the back on suspicion of stealing groceries. A detective tells him he\'s recommending that the District Attorney file murder charges against him, but Poulter\'s character is sent right back out to active duty in the meantime. Did this really happen? Well, there was a riot on. \n \n Other credulity-straining aspects of Detroit appear to be factual: For one thing, Dismukes, a private security guard called in to protect a store near the Algiers from looters, was allowed to enter the Algiers with a weird coalition of Detroit cops and National Guardsmen and remain at a crime scene for hours while trying, ineffectually, to prevent the cops from brutalizing their suspects. (Boyega radiates Denzel-like calm in the face of the storm, proving that the way he livened the The Force Awakens was no fluke — he\'s a bonafide movie star. And to see him in a role where he\'s essentially helpless is unusual, and compelling.) In real life, Dismukes was charged with the felonious assault of two of the suspects and tried before any of the three cops accused of more serious offenses were; an all-white jury acquitted him. To the extent Detroit addresses this, it implies an unsuccessful attempt by the police to frame Dismukes for their own wrongdoing. \n \n I\'m also curious to know whether another one of its plot points is historical or invented: When Michigan State Police arrive at the Algiers, the ranking officer among them decides he wants no part of the ""civil rights mix-up"" the Detroit P.D. has already created, so the state troopers just drive away. What\'s the expression? Huge if true. \n \n Bigelow and Boal\'s recreation of a 50-year-old police brutality case seems bound to be as controversial as their last project, 2012\'s Zero Dark Thirty. Accused in some quarters of defending the C.I.A.\'s use of torture in its decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden, Zero Dark Thirty was really more of a high-tone Rorshach blot for each viewer\'s opinion of the endless War on Terror. Bigelow has always gone for immersion before reflection or judgment. \n \n ""I don\'t think it\'s up to the filmmaker to judge,"" the director told Washington Post chief film critic Ann Hornaday in a profile published last week. And it\'s not as though she\'s only just become interested in identity politics or policing: Long before her metamorphosis into an Oscar-winning maker of Important Films, she made 1990\'s Blue Steel, a sordid thriller that starred Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie patrol officer who comes under suspicion after she kills a robbery suspect whose weapon can\'t be found. It\'s not a particularly good movie, nor one that would remotely satisfy any 2017 test of its wokeness, but it is at least more evidence that Bigelow was thinking about the problems of policing even when she was just making pulp films. \n \n Bigelow\'s quasi-journalistic style has long alienated some viewers; now it\'s infuriating them, too. Chicago critic Angelica Jade Bastien slammed Detroit as ""soulless,"" claiming it isn\'t harsh enough in its condemnation of the misconduct it depicts so mercilessly. Some of her specific complaints about Boal\'s screenplay — that it makes Melvin Dismukes ""too passive a character,"" or that ""there are also brief, disconcerting moments that present some white cops in a great light"" — come from the moments where Boal hews closest to the firsthand accounts Dismukes and Reed shared with him. Dismukes says he did all he could to prevent the bloodshed, which wasn\'t much, and Reed says that after he fled the Algiers he was picked up and taken to the hospital by a cop—one who wasn\'t involved in the nightmare at the hotel. Molding facts into the emotional construct we refer to when use the word story is messy work, even when it\'s done in good faith. \n \n I\'ve seen Detroit only once, but I\'m of the option that Bigelow and Boal have done that good but messy work, resulting in a movie that is maddeningly imperfect but still honorable. The movie opens with a semi-animated sequence that fashions Jacob Lawrence\'s ""Migration Series"" of paintings into a primer on the mass movement of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west after World War I, and the subsequent white flight to the suburbs. That meant that by the 1960s, Detroit was a majority-black city with a majority-white police force. \n \n It\'s to Bigelow\'s credit that she doesn\'t survey the worlds in which she sets her movies in schematic screenwriting terms: Detroit\'s early scenes, wherein a police raid on an unlicensed nightclub that\'s hosting a party for returning veterans sparks a riot, includes a few left turns — one of the black party guests who mouths off to the ""pigs"" turns out to be a narc, for example. This detail serves no narrative purpose; it only serves to underscore the absence of trust between the police and the citizens they\'re sworn to protect and serve. Editor Billy Goldenberg splices in documentary footage with the newly-shot material in this section of the movie, creating a panorama of the climate of mortal fear and volcanic anger between the citizens and the police. \n \n We begin to get our bearings when Reed (Algee Smith) and The Dramatics prepare to perform on a revue at the Fox Theatre where they know a Motown A&R; scout will be in the audience. When the police order the performance stopped and the Fox evacuated, and then their bus home is set upon by rioters, Reed and his friend Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) make the ill-fated decision to wait out the curfew poolside at the Algiers. \n \n The police occupation of the Algiers forms the film\'s harrowing, quite long centerpiece. Bigelow uses all her gifts as a communicator of visceral sensation to summon the horror of spending a night under these vicious cops\' bootheels. It\'s nauseating. By the time Anthony Mackie — playing an out-of-work Vietnam vet who gets thanked for his service by being beaten and spat on by cops — agrees never to speak of what he\'s witnessed, Bigelow and Boal have said all they have to say. \n \n But Detroit continues on to depict the trial of the three officers, leaking tension as it does. If the intent of this section of the film is to illustrate that these cops are not bad apples but rather the functioning-as-designed armature of an inherently racist justice system, it\'s only partially successful. The tactics their lawyer (John Krasinski, weirdly) uses to discredit the prosecution\'s witnesses are as familiar as the Algiers scenes are revolting, and our rage circuits have already blown. \n \n Maybe it\'s just impossible for even a scene-setter as skilled as Bigelow to do anything new in a courtroom. The coda she chooses, showing Larry Reed\'s resolution to continue his musical career in a far more modest fashion than before, has nothing to do with consoling the audience after 135 minutes of trauma. It\'s about Reed becoming a militant for peace. It\'s about him making a choice to survive. If nothing else, Detroit gets you thinking about how those might be the same thing.', 'The intersection of Wheatsheaf and Frankford Ave. on May 13, 2015. ( ALEJANDRO A. ALVAREZ / Staff Photographer ) \n \n Right before the fatal derailment of Amtrak Train 188 a conductor said she believes she heard the engineer say that a window on the train had been ""struck by something,"" National Transporation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said Friday. In the agency\'s final briefing in Philadelphia on Tuesday night\'s horrific accident, Sumwalt said the FBI now was involved in the investigation of the crash that killed eight people and injured 200. The FBI confirmed that it is investigating damage to the windshield of the train but said no separate federal criminal investigation is yet under way. He said that NTSB officials interviewed engineer Brandon Bostian on Friday, and that he ""cooperated fully."" Bostian was accompanied by his attorney, who has said his client suffered a concussion in the crash. \n \n Sumwalt said Bostian told investigators that the last thing he remembers is ringing a train bell as required as he went through the North Philadelphia station. He did not remember the crash. \n \n Sumwalt said Bostian ""did not feel fatigued nor did he report any illness."" He said Bostian, 32, ""demonstrated very good working knowledge of the territory, speed limits and things like that."" Bostian drove the daily New York to Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. and back train run, Monday to Friday. \n \n Sumwalt said that officials also had spoken with a conductor who ""believes she heard her engineer say something about his train being struck by something,"" Sumwalt said. \n \n ""We have seen damage to the left-hand lower portion of the Amtrak windshield that we have asked the FBI to come in and look at for us,"" he added. He said the damage appeared in a ""circular pattern that emanates out quite a bit."" \n \n Right before the crash Tuesday night at Frankford Junction, a SEPTA commuter train and another Amtrak train in the same area were hit by projectiles, one of which crashed through the SEPTA engineer\'s window. \n \n The unnamed conductor told the NTSB she heard the engineer of her Amtrak train talking to the engineer of a SEPTA train about three to four minutes after leaving Philadelphia, Sumwalt said. The woman, a 39-year-old Amtrak worker, was in the fourth car - the cafe car - when she heard the radio conversation. \n \n ""She heard him talking to a SEPTA engineer who reported to a train dispatcher that he had either been hit by a rock or shot at,"" Sumwalt said, ""and that the SEPTA engineer said he had a broken windshield and put the train into an emergency stop."" \n \n Sumwalt said the particular damage that NTSB wants the FBI to examine is the circular pattern of damage on the lower left windshield, as seen from inside the engineer\'s station. \n \n He said the right-hand side of the windshield was shattered by the crash impact. \n \n It was not known when NTSB agency would release a final report on the crash of Train 188. \n \n Bill Shuster (R., Pa.), chairman of the house transportation committee, said Friday he planned to covene hearings on the accident. \n \n In a statement, Amtrak president Joseph Boardman said, ""Amtrak takes full responsibility, and deeply apologizes for our role in this tragic event."" \n \n Meanwhile, work to reopen the stretch of tracks where Amtrak Train 188 derailed, killing eight passengers, moved into high gear Friday, and service along one of the nation\'s most heavily traveled sections of rail was expected to resume Tuesday. \n \n The Northeast Corridor is Amtrak\'s busiest, carrying millions of people annually, and the closure at Frankford Junction has halted Amtrak service between New York and Philadelphia and, by extension, New York and Washington. \n \n It also has forced 12,000 daily riders who use SEPTA\'s Trenton Line to find alternate routes to work and has prevented NJ Transit\'s Atlantic City line trains from getting to and from 30th Street Station. \n \n Officials say Train 188 had accelerated right before the crash and was speeding when it hit the sharp curve at the junction, jumping the tracks after the engineer activated the brakes. \n \n Work is underway to replace 22 track panels along two of the four tracks at the site. Each panel is 60 feet long, Amtrak spokesman Craig Schulz said. \n \n Crews also are installing four new catenary poles - the H-shaped steel structures that hold the overhead wires along the tracks. \n \n ""These guys have literally been working around the clock,"" Schulz said. \n \n He did not have a cost estimate for the work, which also includes testing the signal and power systems. \n \n He said crews will continue working around the clock until repairs are complete. \n \n Against the backdrop of the work to reopen the junction and an ongoing investigation into the derailment, two dozen fire officials, police commanders and first responders gathered at City Hall to speak to about the massive city response to the crash. \n \n The officials said it was an opportunity for the public to hear about the Herculean efforts that were undertaken to rescue wreck victims. The event began with a moment of silence for the dead and injured. \n \n A dispatch supervisor spoke first, saying multiple calls came in from passengers on the wrecked train - who didn\'t know where they were. Officials used technology to identify the location of the cellphone calls. \n \n ""The people were frantic but they were also calm,"" said supervisor Ken Carey. ""They were able to say, \'I\'ve been in an accident, but I don\'t know where I am.\'"" \n \n Repeated themes at the briefing were the horrifying scope of the disaster and the way the many responding agencies cooperated. \n \n Back at the crash scene, a steady beeping of machinery and buzzing of cement trucks could be heard along Frankford Avenue on Friday morning. \n \n Though the scene has been released back to Amtrak, it remained behind police barricades as repair work continued. \n \n White Amtrak pickup trucks came and went from a dusty lot between two warehouses. Beyond the lot, dozens of workers in hard hats and orange vests labored along the tracks. Some later paused to paused to eat a lunch of chicken off paper plates in a parking lot along the tracks Friday afternoon. \n \n Portable spotlights were in place for continuing work through the night. \n \n Earlier Friday, bulldozers cleared the site where the front two cars - which were most damaged in the derailment - had crashed. Larger trucks also arrived on the site, where tents and portable toilets were set up in a staging area. \n \n Six people injured in the derailment remained in critical condition - five at Temple University Hospital (down from six Thursday) and one at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. \n \n Officials have said more than 200 people were injured in the crash, about 150 of whom ended up in hospitals. \n \n At a brief news conference outside Temple University Hospital, U.S. Sen. Robert Casey said he had toured the hospital to get a sense of the challenges facilities faced as victims of the Amtrak crash poured in. \n \n He said he was ""inspired by the really miraculous work that was done here under the most horrific of circumstances."" \n \n Inquirer staff writers Stacey Burling, Paul Nussbaum, and Mari A. Schaefer contributed to this article.']",4,"– Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit tells the story of a black singer who takes refuge in a dingy motel to escape the 1967 Motor City riots.

It's ""daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing."" And ""in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental."" ""It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,"" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit ""a well-made and evocative film"" jam-packed with ""stomach-churning horror."" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But ""maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point."" Chris Klimek says Detroit is ""maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,"" citing ""lightly fictionalized"" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up ""for maximum outrage."" This is ""messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,"" he writes at NPR. He applauds John Boyega, previously of The Force Awakens. Radiating a ""Denzel-like calm,"" he shows ""he's a bonafide movie star,"" Klimek writes. Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film ""tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people."" But Detroit still makes for ""urgent viewing,"" he writes at the Toronto Star. Why? ""The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on,"" when ""a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police."""

202,"['Photo \n \n The parent of the in-flight shopping magazine SkyMall said on Friday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection, citing in-flight Wi-Fi access as one of the factors luring shoppers away from its quirky catalog of travel products, pet toys and garden gnomes. \n \n The company, Xhibit, said that it would sell off its online retail business and other assets. \n \n “Historically, the SkyMall catalog was the sole in-flight option for potential purchasers of products to review while traveling. With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, fewer people browsed the SkyMall in-flight catalog,” Xhibit said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. \n \n Founded in 1990 to cater to airplane passengers with time and money to spare, SkyMall catalog’s often featured wacky product offerings and provided comic relief for travelers riffling through the seat pockets for light reading. \n \n Its 2014 holiday catalog offered a Santa Claus Sculptural Glass-Topped Holiday Table for $129; and $1,000 Serenity Pods for cats and dogs, fitted with a wireless sound system and LED lights, which promised to gently rock them to sleep. More sensible offerings included travel-related items like passport wallets or wrinkle-free resort wear. \n \n Photo \n \n SkyMall’s eclectic lineup contributed to its downfall, its bankruptcy filing suggested. \n \n “Because SkyMall historically did not narrowly tailor its product offerings, SkyMall faced well-established competitors in every market vertical, as well as competition from significant, broad-based e-commerce providers, such as Amazon.com and eBay.com,” the filing said. \n \n Many of SkyMall’s competitors have greater, or vastly greater, resources, longer histories, more customers and higher brand recognition.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The costs of carrying printed SkyMall catalogs also made them increasingly unattractive to airlines, the company said. Delta’s contract with SkyMall ended Nov. 30, and Southwest Airlines told Xhibit in December that it would not carry the catalog beyond April of this year, according to the filing. By the end of December, SkyMall faced “a severe liquidity crisis,” it said. \n \n Sales from Southwest travelers alone made up about 7 percent of its overall merchandise sales and the negative impact on its bottom line could be even greater, the company had warned in an earlier statement. \n \n Still, Paul Swinand, an analyst for Morningstar who covers the retail industry, called the bankruptcy filing surprising. \n \n Photo \n \n “That would seem like it’s a monopoly business,” he said. “Nobody competes with them. Where the SkyMall fell flat was with mobile. If people are on their phones, they’re not browsing the SkyMall catalog.” \n \n Scott Wiley, Xhibit’s acting chief executive, said in a statement that he was “extremely disappointed in this result.” Mr. Wiley replaced the former Xhibit chief, Kevin Weiss, who resigned from the company last year as its woes mounted. \n \n He said Xhibit was “hopeful that SkyMall and the iconic ‘SkyMall’ brand find a home to continue to operate as SkyMall has for the last 25 years.” \n \n In its filing, Xhibit listed assets of $1 million to $10 million, and liabilities of $10 million to $50 million. Delta, American and US Airways were listed among its creditors. \n \n The SkyMall business generated revenue of about $33.7 million in 2013 and $15.8 million for the nine months ended Sept. 28, according to the filing. Debtors estimate that total creditor claims are approximately $12 million, according to the filing', ""SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch)—There’s still time to get that special tortilla baby blanket from SkyMall, of course, but the in-flight catalog’s bankruptcy filing is just the latest black eye for an industry that has lost ground for more than a decade. \n \n The mail-order industry generated $71.4 billion in revenues last year, down 6% from five years ago, according to estimates from analysts at IBISWorld.

Black pastors demand apology from Donald Trump \n \n Instead of endorsements, many black pastors issued Donald Trump demands for an apology for his treatment of racial minorities at a closed-door meeting at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. \n \n The demands, part of an hours-long meeting with dozens of black faith leaders that has been mired in controversy since it was announced on Wednesday, come after many leaders came under fire for meeting with Trump and after his campaign canceled the public portion of the event. But Trump, rarely one to avoid news cameras, held an impromptu press conference anyways and described the meeting as full of “love.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n “It went longer only because of the love. It didn\'t go longer for other reasons,” Trump said of the two-and-a-half hour session. “There were unbelievable solutions, I think, to problems that we will solve that other people won’t be able to solve.” \n \n But there were also disagreements. During the meeting, pastors demanded Trump apologize not only to the black community, but also to Mexicans for his inflammatory rhetoric, according to Bishop Orrin Pullings, a Richmond, Virginia-based pastor. \n \n “Our community really wants him to be sensitive with the way he handles people and they feel he’s insensitive,” said Pullings. “We told him that you are insensitive in appearance to our community and that’s not a good position. He listened to us and you know, I think Donald Trump is a very good listener.” \n \n But others advised Trump against backing down, according to Pullings. “Another crowd said, ‘No you should never apologize. You’re ahead in the polls now because of your big mouth … You start apologizing, you’ve got to keep apologizing.’” \n \n Pullings said Trump remained noncommittal, which he took as a sign that the mogul will not be issuing an apology any time soon. “It’s probably out of the question.” \n \n In Trump’s account of the meeting, pastors did not ask him to tone down his rhetoric. “The tone has taken me to first position in every single poll,” he told reporters afterward. “The beautiful thing about the meeting is they didn’t ask me to change the tone.” \n \n The back-and-forth echoes a similar debate that emerged among evangelical leaders at a similar meeting at Trump Tower in September. At that meeting, which included evangelical leaders of all races, several attendees challenged Trump on his habit of personally attacking critics and rivals and asked him to tone down his rhetoric while others defended Trump’s bombast. The September meeting concluded with those gathered laying hands on Trump and praying over him. \n \n Monday’s meeting was held under more contentious circumstances, and while it opened and closed with prayer, there was no laying on of hands. \n \n Trump has come under fire in the past week for condoning the rough treatment of a Black Lives Matter protester by his white supporters at a campaign rally in Alabama and for tweeting a chart with made-up statistics overstating the percentage of white murder victims killed by blacks. \n \n On Wednesday, Trump’s campaign initially announced the meeting with 100 black pastors and a press conference at which the pastors were to endorse the mogul. But backlash built quickly as other black faith leaders condemned Trump — including in an open letter published by Ebony Magazine. \n \n And on Sunday, Trump’s campaign canceled the open-press portion of the event, writing instead that it expected some pastors to issue endorsements after Monday’s closed-door meeting. \n \n Trump said Monday morning on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that he believed the Black Lives Matter movement had pressured black clergy to withhold their endorsements of him. ""It gets publicity — unfortunately, as everything I do gets publicity — and probably some of the Black Lives Matter folks called them up and said: \'You shouldn\'t be meeting with Trump because he believes that all lives matter,\'"" he said. \n \n According to Pullings, when Trump began to defend the treatment of the Black Lives Matter protester by explaining that there were 10,000 people at the rally and he did not know the race of the man, he was interrupted by Maryland-based Bishop Michael Freeman, who told him, “I have 10,00 members. If someone yells out in my crowd I don’t have them thrown out.” \n \n Pastors also criticized Trump’s mocking impression of a New York Times reporter’s physical handicap. Though Trump and the reporter have met on several occasion and he prefaced his impression by saying, “You ought to see this guy,” Trump maintains he does not know what the reporter looks like.', 'NEW YORK (AP) — Dozens of black pastors pressed Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Monday to address what some called his use of racially charged rhetoric, with several describing a meeting that became tense at times as attendees raised concerns about his blunt language. \n \n Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, center, talks with reporters while surrounded by a group of African-American religious leaders in New York, Monday, Nov. 30, 2015.

""I think they really want to see victory, because ultimately it is about, we want to win and we want to win together."" \n \n At a rally later Monday in Macon, Georgia, Trump told a nearly all-white audience of about 5,000 that the meeting was ""inspiring"" and ""unbelievable."" \n \n ""It was a really terrific day,"" he said. \n \n But several pastors who met in New York with the billionaire real estate mogul, who has held a consistent lead in preference polls of GOP voters for several months due in large part to his aggressive style of campaigning, said the session was a bit more complicated. \n \n Bishop George Bloomer, who traveled to the gathering from North Carolina, said he arrived in New York with concerns about ""the racial comments that have been made and the insensitive comments that have been made,"" including an incident earlier this month in which a black protester was roughed up by Trump supporters at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama. \n \n Trump said after the incident, ""Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing."" \n \n ""I asked him: \'Are you a racist? People are saying that about you,\'"" Bloomer said. ""If you are seeking the African-American community to support you, at the least, you\'re not helping with these kind of things that are going on."" \n \n Bloomer said he told Trump that ""if he wants to have our ear as a community, to at least tone down the rhetoric some kind of way, tone it down. And he said that he would."" \n \n Pastor Al Morgan of Launch Ministries in Raleigh, North Carolina, said part of the group\'s discussion focused on whether Trump should lighten up a bit. \n \n ""What he said was that he would take that into consideration,"" Morgan said. ""So the thing was trying to be who he is, so you have to remain true to yourself. And, in his defense, that\'s gotten him where he is. So the thing is, how do you convey a person\'s heart with their personality? That\'s the dilemma."" \n \n Trump is seeking to replace President Barack Obama, who won two terms in the White House by bringing together a coalition of young people, single women and black and Hispanic voters. \n \n Democrats maintain an enormous edge with African-American voters, with Republican presidential candidates faring poorly among minorities in the past two elections. In 2012, according to exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks, 93 percent of black voters backed Obama. In 2008, the number was 95 percent. \n \n But Trump has been courting the support of evangelical black clergy members and other African-American leaders as he works to broaden his appeal in a crowded Republican field. \n \n In Georgia, radio host and failed 2012 presidential hopeful Herman Cain was among those who introduced Trump. Cain was the lone major black Republican candidate four years ago. Trump also interrupted his own 75-minute speech to bring another black Georgia Republican to the microphone. Bruce LeVell, who has served as party chairman in suburban Atlanta\'s Gwinett County, announced his endorsement, drawing roars from Trump\'s backers. \n \n Monday\'s meeting with the pastors was originally promoted by the campaign as an endorsement event, in which he would receive the backing of 100 black evangelical and religious leaders. \n \n But many of those invited to the meet-and-greet objected to that description, saying they accepted the invitation only because they wanted to challenge Trump about what he\'s said as a candidate. \n \n Trump kicked off his campaign with a speech in which he said some Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals, and recently drew criticism for retweeting an image of inaccurate statistics that vastly overrepresented the number of whites killed by blacks, among other errors. \n \n In a letter published by Ebony magazine, more than 100 black religious leaders wrote that ""Trump\'s racially inaccurate, insensitive and incendiary rhetoric should give those charged with the care of the spirits and souls of black people great pause."" \n \n They also expressed concern that Monday\'s gathering would ""give Trump the appearance of legitimacy among those who follow your leadership and respect your position as clergy."" \n \n Pastor Victor Couzens, from Cincinnati, Ohio, said he nonetheless felt an obligation to attend the meeting to hear what Trump had to say. \n \n ""It\'s very unfortunate the way he has talked to not just the African-American community, but things he\'s said about women and Mexicans and Muslims,"" Couzens said. ""But what\'s more discouraging than the things that he has said is the fact that in the face of him saying all of these things, he continues to surge in the polls."" \n \n And some attendees emerged expressing full-throated support for Trump. \n \n ""What we were able to do today was allow people to see his heart for themselves and to make up their own minds about him,"" said Darrell Scott, the senior pastor of New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, who helped to organize the meeting. ""They find out that he\'s not the person that the media has depicted him to be."" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporter Bill Barrow contributed from Macon, Georgia. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Jill Colvin on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/colvinj', 'It seemed like a powerful counterpoint to the perception of Donald Trump as intolerant: A hundred black ministers and religious leaders would endorse him at his offices in Manhattan, vouching for his sensitivity and broad-mindedness. \n \n But within hours of the announcement a few days ago, furious backtracking, denials and finger-pointing were underway. \n \n By Monday afternoon, the supposed declaration of support from a cross-section of African-Americans seemed to crumble as several pastors insisted they had never agreed to attend or back Mr. Trump. In the end, his political debut with black leaders was refashioned into a private meeting with a smaller group that played down talk of endorsements. \n \n A few of those who showed up sounded uncomfortable. “It appears as if he’s a possible racist based upon some of the things he said about black America,” said Brehon Hall, a preacher from Toledo, Ohio, as he headed into the meeting at Trump Tower.']",3,"– Donald Trump says a meeting with dozens of black pastors at Trump Tower on Monday was ""amazing,"" ""inspiring,"" and ""unbelievable""—but he has no intention of changing his campaign's tone. His campaign initially said the summit would be followed by public endorsements from more than 100 clergy members, though it later canceled the public part of the meeting and pastors say there were plenty of disagreements during the talk, Politico reports. ""I asked him: 'Are you a racist?'"" Bishop George Bloomer tells the AP. ""People are saying that about you,"" Bloomer says he told Trump. ""If you are seeking the African-American community to support you, at the least, you're not helping with these kind of things that are going on."" Clergy members say the roughing up of a Black Lives Matter protester at a Trump rally was discussed, as was Trump's rhetoric on immigration. Afterward, Trump said, ""The beautiful thing about the meeting is they didn't ask me to change the tone,"" per Politico. Some attendees say he did agree to soften his tone somewhat, though the AP reports that at a Monday evening rally in Macon, Ga., where he was introduced by Herman Cain, Trump repeated the positions on immigration that the pastors had been concerned about. But he has adopted a ""newly conciliatory tone on racial matters,"" according to the New York Times: Trump and the clergy members who met with him were strongly criticized by the Rev. Al Sharpton on Monday, and Trump's only response in a Times interview was, ""Deep down inside, Al likes me a lot."""

It beat notable events such as the World Cup, the Ebola outbreak, the March disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the Ice Bucket Challenge, an Internet video craze to raise awareness and money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\'s Disease. \n \n Other topics of worldwide intrigue on Google included the addictive smartphone game ""Flappy Bird,"" bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst, the Middle East extremist group ISIS, the hit Disney movie ""Frozen,"" and the Winter Olympics in Russia. \n \n Williams, Ebola, the World Cup and the Ice Bucket also ranked among the most-discussed subjects this year on Facebook, which released its list last week. Google released its list Tuesday. \n \n Williams\' death drove many people to reminisce about his career highlights. In the first few days after his suicide, there was a six-fold increase in the number of Google searches for ""carpe diem"" — a Latin phrase for ""seize the day"" that Williams popularized in the film ""Dead Poets Society.""

207,"['The U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday that 16 million children living in America received food stamps in 2014, or about one out of every five kids. \n \n Census said that number is up dramatically from 2007, before the Great Recession, when 9 million kids were receiving food stamps, or about one in eight. The data comes from Census’ 2014 survey on families. \n \n “The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007,” Census said. \n \n The findings are likely to bolster claims from some Republicans that the Obama administration seems to have a goal of putting more people under government aid programs. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 called President Barack Obama the “food stamp president,” which led some to say his comment was racist. \n \n The debate over food stamps has led to a sort of chicken-and-egg argument between Republicans and Democrats. The GOP has said the end of the recession should allow Congress to reduce spending on food stamps. \n \n While Democrats have tried to give President Barack Obama credit for a rebounding economy, they also note that millions of additional people are using food stamps, and that the program should not be cut yet. The total number of people using food stamps has almost doubled since the start of the Great Recession, to nearly 48 million in 2013. \n \n The number finally dipped from that peak in 2014, but just a little, to about 46 million people. \n \n Republicans have tried since 2013 to cut food stamp spending, as part of their overall plan to slow spending and get control of the budget deficit. In 2013, the House voted to cut $39 billion from food stamps over a decade, and almost a year ago, President Barack Obama signed a final deal that will cut just $8.7 billion from the program over ten years. \n \n That cut was estimated to reduce food stamp benefits by about $90 per month for the hundreds of thousands of homes that use them.', 'WASHINGTON The number of children in the United States relying on food stamps for a meal spiked to 16 million last year, according federal data, signaling a lopsided economic recovery in which lower income families are still lagging behind. \n \n The roughly one in five children who received food stamps in 2014 surpassed pre-recession levels, when one in eight or 9 million children were on food stamps, according to the U.S. Census survey of American families released on Wednesday \n \n Republicans in Congress have sought to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or food stamp program as part of a larger plan to balance the budget. \n \n Early last year lawmakers proposed $40 billion in cuts from the program over 10 years. The final farm bill signed into law trimmed $8.6 billion from the program, eliminating benefits for about 850,000 people, according to estimates by anti-hunger advocates. \n \n Other findings of the survey show a rapidly changing America in which more children are being raised in single-parent homes and more young people are delaying marriage. \n \n Of the 73.7 million children under 18 in the United States, 27 percent were living in single parent homes last year, tripling the 9 percent in 1960. \n \n The number of marriages also dwindled last year with less than half of households in America made up of married couples, compared to three-quarters in 1940, the survey found. \n \n The median age for people first getting married in 2014 was 29 for men and 27 for women up from 24 and 21 respectively in 1947. \n \n (Reporting by Elvina Nawaguna; Editing by Sandra Maler)', 'The number of children receiving food stamps remains higher than it was before the start of the Great Recession in 2007, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual Families and Living Arrangements table package released today. \n \n \n \n The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007. In 2014, an estimated 16 million children, or about one in five, received food stamp assistance compared with the roughly 9 million children, or one in eight, that received this form of assistance prior to the recession. \n \n \n \n These statistics come from the 2014 Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement, which has collected statistics on families and living arrangements for more than 60 years. Today’s table package delves into the characteristics of households, including the marital status of the householders and their relationship to the children residing in the household. The historical data on America’s families and living arrangements can be found on census.gov.']",3,"– There are roughly 73.7 million kids running around America, and about 16 million, or nearly one in five, of them are doing so fueled by food stamps, according to US Census data out yesterday. That number is particularly alarming when compared to pre-recession levels: In 2007, some 9 million, or one in eight, kids were on food stamps. There are currently about 46 million Americans total on food stamps, down from the 2013 peak of 48 million. The jump signals what Reuters says is a ""lop-sided"" economic recovery that has left low-income people behind, but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs. As the Blaze notes, Republicans want to scale back the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—arguing that the end of the recession should indicate less need—and trimmed $8.6 billion and 850,000 people from its rolls with last year's farm bill.

208,"['Study Highlights: \n \n A commonly used heartburn medication caused blood vessel cells to age faster in laboratory testing. \n \n These findings could help explain recent reports linking long-term use of heartburn medication to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia. \n \n Clinical studies still are necessary to determine if the drugs damage blood vessel cells within the body. \n \n Embargoed until 3 p.m. CT / 4 p.m. ET Tuesday, May 10, 2016 \n \n DALLAS, May 10, 2016 — A popular over-the-counter medication for heartburn, caused laboratory blood vessel cells to age quicker, according to new research in Circulation Research, an American Heart Association journal. \n \n Reflux, often called heartburn, occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing irritation and damage. Mild reflux is fairly common, but frequent, severe occurrences, known as GERD for gastroesophageal reflux disease, can cause significant discomfort and may require treatment. Many people find relief by using over-the-counter medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce acid produced by the stomach. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates that 1 in 14 Americans have used PPIs. \n \n After recent evidence linking long-term PPI use to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia, researcher sought to identify how PPIs increase risk by studying their effects on blood vessel cells. \n \n Now, researchers at Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI) say they have discovered that long term exposure to PPIs “accelerated biological aging in human endothelial cells which line the inside of blood vessels. When healthy, human endothelial cells create a Teflon-like coating that prevents blood from sticking. When older and diseased, the endothelium becomes more like Velcro, with blood elements sticking to the vessel to form blockages.” \n \n They also found that long-term PPI exposure impairs acid production by the lysosomes in the cells lining the blood vessel walls. They noted that the lysosome — the part of the cell that typically clears waste products — did not produce enough acid to clear waste. In turn, the buildup of waste caused the cell to age rapidly. Notably, another type of antacid known as an H2 antagonist, did not have this adverse effect. \n \n “Lysosomes are like the garbage disposal of cells,” said John P. Cooke, M.D., Ph.D., study lead author and professor and chair of the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences at the HMRI and director of the Houston Methodist Research Institute Center for Cardiovascular Regeneration in Texas. “They need to generate acid to get rid of cellular rubbish, and when cellular rubbish accumulates the cells age faster.” \n \n Although PPIs can be effective for short-term use, they are not meant for extended treatment, researchers said. PPIs do not require a prescription or doctor’s supervision, which can lead to overuse. \n \n “With the knowledge that PPIs are being used by millions of people for indications and durations that were never tested or approved, it may be time for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies to re-visit the specificity and the safety of these agents,” Cooke said. “Unless otherwise indicated, physicians should consider PPIs only for short-term use for relief of symptoms of GERD, since we now have a ‘smoking gun’ that helps explain the consistent observational evidence of increased risk.” \n \n Cooke added that there are other approaches to long-term treatment that might be considered for GERD including H2 antagonists, lifestyle modifications, and in severe cases, surgical approaches. \n \n The current one has several limitations. Although two different PPIs were tested, only one of these esomeprazole (brand name Nexium) is commercially available. In addition, it did not show how PPIs actually impair the lysosome’s ability to produce enough acid to clear waste. Finally, since this study was in a laboratory setting, it could not show whether PPIs act in the same way within the human body, and long-term clinical trials are necessary. \n \n Co-authors are Gautham Yepuri, Ph.D.; Roman Sukhovershin, Ph.D.; Timo Z.

If you\'re pregnant, you should avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium trisilicate.

In fact, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are used to treat acid reflux and heartburn, are among the most prescribed drugs in the country, with millions taking them, and they're becoming more widely available over-the-counter, reports CNN. But a preliminary report just released by the American Heart Association is concerned that the drug—already associated with a higher risk of heart attack and other vascular problems, as the AHA reported earlier this year—may also increase one's risk of ischemic stroke, the most common type caused when a clot cuts off blood flow to the brain. ""At one time, PPIs were thought to be safe, without major side effects,"" the study's lead author says. “This study further questions the cardiovascular safety of these drugs."" Researchers followed nearly a quarter-million patients in Denmark who were suffering from stomach pain and indigestion and had an endoscopy. Their average age was 57, and six years later those taking one of four PPIs (Prilosec, Protonix, Prevacid, or Nexium) had a 21% higher risk of stroke than those not taking one. Lowest-dose PPIs didn't increase the risk much if at all, while highest-dose increased it, from 30% for Prevacid to 94% for Protonix. Another type of acid-lowering meds called H2 blockers (think Pepcid and Zantac) showed no elevated risk. ""As a culture, we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems, when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals, drinking less alcohol, or not smoking,"" one doc told CNN in 2010.

That\'s because her first was born on Aug, 8, 2008, her second on Sept. 9, 2009 and her most recent on Oct. 10, 2010. Yes, that\'s 8-8-08, 9-9-09 and 10-10-10. The Rockford, Mich., mom and husband Chad weren\'t thinking about dates when their children were born. Their doctor had to give drugs to start labor for the couple\'s first daughter, Chloe Corrin Soper, who was born full term on Aug. 8 at Spectrum Health\'s Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich. Their son was a surprise all around. ""He wasn\'t a planned baby at all, he was a miracle,"" says Barbara Soper. He was due on Sept. 20, 2009, but because sister Chloe\'s birth had caused some hemorrhaging, their doctor, Andrew Van Slooten, suggested he come out a little early so he\'d be smaller. Soper was started on drugs to induce labor on Sept. 8, but it took 24 hours before Cameron Dane Soper made his way into the world, arriving on 9-9-09. Soper says she and her husband had thought it would be ""neat"" if their third child was born on 10-10-10 but because her due date wasn\'t until Nov. 4, it seemed unlikely. But it ended up being ""kind of a mandatory eviction,"" says Soper. She developed blood clots in her legs and three weeks before her due date doctors told her the baby needed to be delivered. The induction was begun on 10-9-10, but it wasn\'t until 6:53 on Sunday night, 10-10-10, that Cearra Nicole Soper arrived. Despite being three weeks early, ""she\'s feeding well,"" says mom. ""She\'s a trooper."" While the dates might seem ""incredibly rare,"" they\'re really not. Such a lineup can only happen in the first 12 years of the century and at least 10 months apart, says Shannon McWeeney, a professor of biostatistics at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. ""Given that the first birth occurred in that window, the probability is not as astronomical as you might be compelled to think,"" she says.In fact, it\'s not that high a number at all, says Philip Stark, a professor of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. ""The \'chance\' you get depends on the assumptions you make,"" he says. One set of assumptions gives a chance of about 1 in 50 million. More realistic assumptions — including allowing at least 11 months between births — increases it to about 1 in 2,500. Since thousands of women in the United States had kids in 2008, 2009 and 2010, this suddenly seems a little less extraordinary. But humans ""like to look for patterns, to make sense of things"" he says.For the Sopers, three is simply their lucky number — ""we don\'t have any more planned,"" says Barbara.

That\'s because it was the third baby for the Soper family born on a numerical anomaly. \n \n Baby number one came on 8-8-08. Baby number two came on 9-9-09, and, yes, Sunday was 10-10-10. \n \n It\'s an almost impossibly cool coincidence -- especially when you consider her third baby wasn\'t due until November of this year but came early, and she didn\'t schedule C-sections with any of the kids. \n \n But let\'s do a little math of our own here, shall we? \n \n Barbara Soper has been either pregnant or recovering from giving birth since late 2007. It is now late 2010. \n \n Can we send her some condolence cards along with those congratulatory bouquets? \n \n Many women who have had their kids in quick succession tout the advantages to getting their childbearing over in one fell swoop: having little to no break in between the kids means they\'re closer in age and can play with each other on almost the same level; once you potty train one you can start the next one and escape the diaper stage faster; and of course you don\'t have the ""lost baby weight, now I\'m pregnant again"" conundrum. \n \n But there\'s a reason doctors discourage the practice. \n \n Pregnancy and childbirth both do a number on the body -- especially the uterus, your baby\'s house for the next nine months. It takes a minimum of six weeks after delivery to return to its normal size, but it still needs time to recover to again be a hospitable home for a fetus. \n \n New studies have likewise found women really DO need to lose that baby weight before embarking on a new pregnancy. As counter-intuitive as it sounds, there\'s less strain on the body (and less risk to the fetus) if your body has gone back down to a healthy weight before the next pregnancy begins. \n \n Add to that, if you\'re planning to nurse your kids for longer than nine months, it\'s possible to do it -- but it\'s needlessly complicated when babies are born one on top of another. \n \n Barbara and Chad Soper say she never planned for this to happen. Her son was a surprise pregnancy, and her second and third children were born earlier than their due dates -- she was due on September 20, 2009 with Cameron, who was born September 9, and little Cearra born this month was actually due November 4. \n \n Congrats to the family on their mathematical surprises! \n \n Does anyone have tips for them on three kids under 3? \n \n Image via Spectrum Health']",2,"– Barbara Soper managed a feat that seems like it should be impossible: She had her three children on 8/8/08, 9/9/09, and 10/10/10.

Of course, along come the statisticians to make the story a lot less magical: “The probability is not as astronomical as you might be compelled to think,” says one. Another says the chance of such a series of births is about 1 in 2,500—not all that “extraordinary,” he says, since thousands of women in the US gave birth during those years.

Eleven years later, Boulder\'s top prosecutor exonerated the Ramseys — but a new independent analysis of DNA evidence in the case calls that into question. ( Patrick Davison / Rocky Mountain News via AP ) \n \n The DNA evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case doesn\'t support a pivotal and controversial development in Colorado\'s most vexing unsolved murder — a former Boulder prosecutor\'s decision to clear the girl\'s family from all suspicion in her death, a joint Daily Camera/9NEWS investigation has found. \n \n Forensic experts who examined the results of DNA tests obtained exclusively by the two news organizations disputed former District Attorney Mary Lacy\'s conclusion that a DNA profile found in one place on JonBenet\'s underpants and two locations on her long johns was necessarily the killer\'s — which Lacy had asserted in clearing JonBenet\'s family of suspicion. \n \n In fact, those experts said the evidence showed that the DNA samples recovered from the long johns came from at least two people in addition to JonBenet — something Lacy\'s office was told, according to documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS, but that she made no mention of in clearing the Ramseys. \n \n The presence of a third person\'s genetic markers has never before been publicly revealed. \n \n Additionally, the independent experts raised the possibility that the original DNA sample recovered from JonBenet\'s underwear — long used to identify or exclude potential suspects — could be a composite and not that of a single individual. \n \n About this story Charlie Brennan of the Daily Camera and Kevin Vaughan of 9NEWS exclusively obtained laboratory test results and reports from the JonBenet Ramsey case on which then-Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy based her decision to exonerate members of the Ramsey family. The reporters sought a review of that evidence by independent experts. This is the result of their investigation. \n \n More from 9NEWS See additional coverage of the DNA evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case at 9 and 10 p.m. Thursday and Friday on KUSA-Channel 9, or watch the full report at 9NEWS.com. \n \n ""It\'s a rather obvious point, but I mean, if you\'re looking for someone that doesn\'t exist, because actually it\'s several people, it\'s a problem,"" said Troy Eid, a former U.S. Attorney for Colorado. \n \n The documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS included results from the actual DNA testing process on the long johns and summary reports sent to Lacy\'s office in the months leading up her July 9, 2008, letter exonerating the Ramseys. \n \n The experts who examined the laboratory results at the request of the Camera and 9NEWS reached similar conclusions on multiple points: \n \n • Two of the three samples that led Lacy to declare publicly that no one in the Ramsey family could be responsible for the murder actually appear to include genetic material from at least three people: JonBenet, the person whose DNA profile originally was located in JonBenet\'s underwear during testing in the late 1990s and early 2000s, plus at least one additional as-yet-unidentified person or persons. Consequently, its meaning is far from clear. \n \n • The DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1 — first identified during testing on the panties — may not be the DNA of a single person at all, but, rather, a composite of genetic material from multiple individuals. As a result, it may be worthless as evidence. \n \n • The presence of that DNA on JonBenet\'s underwear and long johns, be it from one or multiple people, may very well be innocent; the profiles were developed from minute samples that could have been the result of inconsequential contact with other people, or transferred from another piece of clothing. If true, it would contradict the assertions that DNA will be key to finding JonBenet\'s killer. \n \n A Boulder police officer sits in her cruiser on Jan. 3, 1997, outside the 15th Street home in which 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found dead on Dec. 26, 1996. The murder remains unsolved nearly 20 years later. (David Zalubowski / Associated Press) \n \n This represents the first time independent experts have reviewed the DNA evidence on which Lacy based her widely questioned exoneration of the family. \n \n And the findings could cut both ways. \n \n ""It\'s certainly possible that an intruder was responsible for the murder, but I don\'t think that the DNA evidence proves it,"" said William C. Thompson, a professor in the Department of Criminology, Law and Society at the University of California-Irvine and an internationally respected authority on DNA evidence and its applications in the criminal justice system. \n \n Similarly, the findings don\'t implicate or exonerate anyone in the family. \n \n Ramsey lawyer Lin Wood, who has not reviewed the documents or the work of the experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS, said, however, ""I have absolute and total confidence in the integrity of former District Attorney Mary Lacy, and I am also aware of internet comments by former Boulder police Chief Mark Beckner where he, within the last several months, affirmed that the Ramsey case was a DNA case. \n \n ""So I know what Chief Beckner has said publicly in recent months, I know what ... former District Attorney Mary Lacy has said, and until someone impugns her integrity, or contradicts former Chief Beckner\'s statement, I continue to believe, as I have said before, that this is a DNA case and that the best chance for solving the case will be a hit and match on the DNA in the future. I hope that day comes."" \n \n \'The silver bullet misfired\' \n \n Lacy was long known as a believer in the Ramseys\' innocence, something others noticed as early as June 1998, when Boulder police detectives put on a detailed two-day presentation of the evidence and sought either charges against John and Patsy Ramsey or a grand jury investigation. \n \n ""My impression of her response to that was that she was among the very, very skeptical,"" said former Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant, who attended the police presentation in his role as adviser to then-Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter. \n \n The experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS suggested that Lacy may have been guilty of ""confirmation bias,"" a phenomenon in which investigators become so blinded by their own theories that they give extra credence to evidence that supports them, and ignore evidence that does not. \n \n The lab that performed the DNA testing, for example, told Lacy in March 2008 that it was ""likely"" the two samples found on JonBenet\'s long johns came from ""more than two people"" and ""should not be considered a single-source profile,"" according to the documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS. \n \n But in exonerating the Ramseys with a three-page letter made public July 9, 2008, Lacy failed to disclose any of that, writing that ""the previously identified profile from the crotch of the underwear worn by JonBenet at the time of the murder matched the DNA recovered from the long johns."" \n \n The word ""match"" actually never appears in the reports from Bode Technology, which conducted the testing in March through June of 2008. \n \n Similarly, the Camera and 9NEWS have learned that investigators in Lacy\'s office suggested no additional testing was needed once they learned male DNA had been located on the long johns that she later labeled as a ""match"" to the DNA found in JonBenet\'s panties. \n \n Correspondence from an investigator on Lacy\'s staff indicated that ""my bosses"" were ""very excited"" and ""pleased"" about the purported match, ""and don\'t see the need for additional testing (unless you strongly recommend otherwise)."" \n \n The twin realities pointed to by the experts — that the genetic profile may not be from a single individual and that DNA on the girl\'s clothing may have landed there innocently — turn on its head Lacy\'s assertion that investigators had identified the killer\'s genetic fingerprint and that it was the key critical to solving the case. \n \n Thompson, the UC-Irvine professor, noted that many people have come to see DNA evidence as a foolproof ""silver bullet"" to solving many crimes. \n \n ""Here, the silver bullet misfired,"" said Thompson, one of the experts who reviewed the evidence at the news organizations\' request. \n \n \'Something I can\'t explain\' \n \n Former Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who called for a review of the Ramsey case in October 1999 to determine whether it merited the attention of a statewide grand jury — his panel of advisers told him it did not — said Lacy\'s exoneration made no sense to him at the time and is even more troubling now. \n \n ""This is an important development. This is new information,"" Owens said. \n \n ""She knew, based on your investigation, that this DNA wasn\'t necessarily from one person and that it, in fact, was potentially accumulated DNA,"" Owens said. ""She knew it at the time, and why she used this evidence to clear the Ramsey family ... is something I can\'t explain. And she should explain."" \n \n Lacy did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story, sent to her by email, U.S. mail and left at her home. \n \n Donald R. Von Hagen, a spokesman for Virginia-based Bode Cellmark Forensics, as the lab is now known, said in an email that the company\'s report ""stands on its own"" and that he would not have further comment. \n \n The murder of JonBenet exploded into the national consciousness within days of the discovery of her body on Dec. 26, 1996, in the sprawling home she shared with her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and older brother, Burke, on 15th Street in Boulder. The 6-year-old\'s skull was fractured by a blow to the head, and her killer cinched a garrote around her neck, placed duct tape over her mouth and bound her wrists. \n \n Everyone from seasoned investigators to amateur sleuths to talk show hosts quickly settled on one of two theories: That JonBenet was slain by someone in her family, either accidentally or in a fit of rage, and that the killer then tried to make it look like a botched kidnapping; or, that she was the victim of a cunning intruder who intended to spirit the child out of the house, but ended up committing murder instead. \n \n John Ramsey, the girl\'s father, declined a request for an interview. \n \n ""I think we have said all that can be said and I need to get back to my job!"" Ramsey wrote in an email. \n \n \'We don\'t actually have to live with it\' \n \n The implications of the conclusions reached by the experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS could, if considered by investigators still working the state\'s most famous cold case, dramatically impact the future direction of their work. At the time the Bode results were returned, Lacy\'s office had control of the Ramsey investigation, and Boulder police did not reclaim responsibility for the probe until Lacy left office the following year. \n \n On one hand, it could lead detectives to consider anew the possibility that someone in JonBenet\'s family was responsible for her death. And it could also lead them to take a new look at dozens of potential suspects who were ruled out because their DNA didn\'t match the profile known as Unknown Male 1. \n \n Eid, who served as Owens\' chief counsel and was on the governor\'s statewide panel that reviewed the case in 1999, said in a recent interview he had suspected in 2008 that Lacy\'s exoneration was, at the very least, misleading. \n \n ""But now, it really looks wrong in the scheme of things,"" Eid said. ""And it\'s not one of these instances where you think, in hindsight, she made a tough call, but we\'ve got to live with it. No, we actually don\'t have to live with it anymore. Right?"" \n \n Lacy\'s successor as Boulder\'s district attorney, Stan Garnett, remembers exactly where he was when he learned of Lacy\'s decision to exonerate the Ramseys: sitting at LaGuardia Airport in New York waiting for a flight home when news of Lacy\'s letter crawled across a television screen. Although he called Lacy ""an honorable person"" and an ""honest district attorney,"" he also said he was — and is — puzzled by her decision. \n \n The job of a district attorney is to file charges in cases where the evidence warrants it, Garnett said. \n \n ""Our role is not to issue random exonerations of people in cases, and it\'s very confusing when that happens,"" Garnett added. \n \n Although Garnett said he is not bound by Lacy\'s decision, it has lasting ramifications for countless people beyond John Ramsey and Burke Ramsey, now 29. Patsy Ramsey succumbed to ovarian cancer in June 2006. \n \n Boulder police investigators continue to use the problematic DNA profile known as Unknown Male 1 to clear others who might potentially have been involved in the killing. A case investigator said dozens of suspects have been cleared that way. \n \n Boulder police Chief Greg Testa declined this week to comment on the DNA evidence. But in a video statement released to all media on Sept. 1, Testa said detectives in the department had submitted more than 200 DNA samples in the case for analysis. \n \n \'This could easily be a composite profile\' \n \n At the crux of the evidence is the DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1. \n \n That profile was first developed in late 1998 and early 1999 from tests on JonBenet\'s panties — but analysts couldn\'t at that time identify sufficient genetic markers. Sending it to the FBI\'s Combined DNA Index System — the national genetic database commonly known as CODIS — requires at least 10 markers. \n \n Further lab work in 2003 yielded an additional marker, and the profile, featuring the required minimum of 10 genetic markers, was entered into CODIS that December. \n \n ""People believed back in those days almost all mixtures are two-person mixtures — that was like gospel truth,"" said Phillip Danielson, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Denver and science adviser to the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center. \n \n In the ensuing years, as the ""kits"" used to detect DNA became ever more sensitive, scientists came to realize that many mixtures contained genetic markers from more than two people. \n \n ""You know,"" Danielson said, ""looking at the profiles in this case, it seems pretty clear that their idea of this \'unknown male\' — this could easily be a composite profile. Meaning that we have multiple contributors. But because of the low sensitivity of the kit, they interpreted those multiple contributors as being just one extra person."" \n \n However, Lacy — and others — concluded that profile must belong to JonBenet\'s killer. \n \n Against that backdrop, an investigator in Lacy\'s office submitted JonBenet\'s panties, long johns, nightgown and other items for further testing at Bode\'s lab in Lorton, Va., in late 2007 and early 2008. \n \n The Bode scientists could not replicate the profile found in JonBenet\'s panties, which bothered Danielson as he examined the materials obtained by the two news organizations. \n \n ""Reproducibility and repeatability is a hallmark of science,"" Danielson said. ""To me, as a scientist, that does raise concern. If there was this unknown male DNA on the underwear, you would expect that Bode would have been able to reproduce that. Now, are there any possible explanations why they would not be? Sure."" \n \n The sample could have been degraded, though Danielson said that\'s not likely given the way evidence is handled and stored. Another possibility is that the original tests consumed all of the foreign genetic material in the panties. It\'s also possible that variations in the way the original tests were done could account for the failure to find the same profile in the panties during the 2008 tests. \n \n \'Should not be considered a single source profile\' \n \n When analysts at Bode tested the long johns, they focused on four distinct areas: the inside and outside of both the upper left and upper right sides of the garment. The tests on the two spots on the inside of the long johns yielded too little DNA to be useful. \n \n But on the outside of the long johns, Bode analysts found much more DNA. \n \n According to a March 24, 2008, report from Bode, a copy of which was obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS, the sample from the right side, labeled as 2S07-101-05A, included DNA containing ""a mixture of at least two individuals including the victim and at least one male contributor."" They got the same results on the left side, which was labeled 2S07-101-05B. \n \n But in notes included with the report, it\'s clear the Bode analysts concluded that those two samples contained genetic material from at least three people. After assuming that JonBenet was one of those people, the analysts were left with the ""remaining DNA contribution."" \n \n ""Based on the results,"" according to the report, ""it is likely more than two people contributed to the mixtures observed in 2S07-101-05A and 2S07-101-05B therefore, the remaining DNA contribution should not be considered a single source profile."" \n \n Christopher McKee, a former public defender in both Atlanta and Washington, D.C., and now director of the Schaden Experiential Learning & Public Service Programs at the University of Colorado Law School, concurred. \n \n ""My own personal review of the material and looking at the allele information at the various loci is that it looks and appears to me to be at least three individuals,"" McKee said. McKee also teaches an advanced course on Forensic Science in the Courts at the CU Law School, teaches on the subject around the country and has been recognized by courts and nationally as an expert on the topic. \n \n Danielson also said, ""There are too many alleles to be accounted for by only JonBenet and this alleged Unknown Male No. 1 profile."" \n \n An allele is a specific genetic marker. \n \n Lacy\'s investigator asked Bode\'s analysts to compare the DNA from the two spots on the outside of the long johns with the Unknown Male 1 profile. \n \n Bode\'s analysts concluded that Unknown Male 1 ""could not be excluded as a possible contributor to the mixture DNA profile"" obtained from the outside of the long johns on the right side, according to a June 20, 2008, report obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS. On the left side, the Unknown Male 1 profile ""cannot be included or excluded from the mixture DNA profile."" \n \n In other words, the link between the two spots on the long johns and the DNA in the underwear is tenuous at best, according to analysts at the lab Lacy used for the testing. \n \n \'There is no innocent explanation\' \n \n But a little more than two weeks later, Lacy wrote the letter clearing members of the Ramsey family of suspicion. However, she included none of the caveats spelled out in the Bode reports and used language suggesting the lab work was ironclad. \n \n ""The Bode Technology laboratory was able to develop a profile from DNA recovered from the two sides of the long johns,"" Lacy wrote. ""The previously identified profile from the crotch of the underwear worn by JonBenet at the time of the murder matched the DNA recovered from the long johns at Bode. \n \n ""Despite substantial efforts over the years to identify the source of this DNA, there is no innocent explanation for its incriminating presence at three sites on those two different items of clothing that JonBenet was wearing at the time of her murder."" \n \n The experts consulted by the news organizations disagreed, to varying degrees, on both assertions — that the Unknown Male 1 profile ""matched"" the DNA found on the outside of the long johns, and that there was ""no innocent explanation"" for the presence of that DNA on JonBenet\'s clothing. \n \n ""You have to understand a match is an analyst\'s judgment that the two samples fall into the \'included\' category,"" Thompson said. ""A match doesn\'t mean that the material examined is necessarily identical — just that there\'s a sufficient consistency to think that it might have come from the same source."" \n \n Thompson said his analysis found ""a strong level of consistency"" between the two long johns samples and the Unknown Male 1 profile. \n \n ""But,"" he said, ""there are also some genetic characteristics that could not be accounted for by either JonBenet Ramsey or Unknown Male 1, thus suggesting there could be DNA from other people."" \n \n Danielson and another expert consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS offered similar opinions. \n \n ""To simply state that there\'s no innocent way that this DNA could have arrived at separate sites on JonBenet\'s underwear ... there\'s simply no scientific justification to make such a statement,"" Danielson said. ""It\'s just simply not true."" \n \n Danielson offered a hypothetical: Say JonBenet had physical contact with other kids she was recently playing with, or had contact at a party on Christmas night, or say she touched anything bearing others\' DNA; she could have then transferred that genetic material to her own clothes simply while getting dressed. \n \n McKee, based on his review of the evidence, called Lacy\'s actions based on the lab reports ""a cautionary tale."" \n \n ""I don\'t think her letter at all reflects an appreciation or understanding for what that said in the report,"" McKee said. ""You know, as I read the (Lacy) letter, it seems to suggest that there\'s just one single profile that was found here."" \n \n \'False logic of declaring this as exonerating\' \n \n Michael Kane, who served as lead counsel to the Ramsey grand jury, is now senior legal counsel to the Judiciary Committee in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He expressed little surprise that Lacy\'s decision had been thrown into serious doubt. \n \n ""Until you ID who that (unknown sample) is, you can\'t make that kind of statement (that Lacy made),"" Kane said in an email. ""There may be circumstances where male DNA is discovered on or in the body of a victim of a sexual assault where you can say with a degree of certainty that had to have been from the perpetrator and from that, draw the conclusion that someone who doesn\'t meet that profile is excluded. \n \n ""But in a case like this, where the DNA is not from sperm, is only on the clothing and not her body, until you know whose it is, you can\'t say how it got there. And until you can say how it got there, you can\'t connect it to the crime and conclude it excludes anyone else as the perpetrator. And that\'s the false logic of declaring this as exonerating. It seems to me to be pretty self-evident."" \n \n As for potentially innocent explanations to the presence of DNA on the clothes JonBenet was wearing when she died, all three experts said they are numerous. \n \n ""There have been some very intriguing studies where they had people hold hands for a very short period of time and then touch a knife handle,"" Danielson said. \n \n In some cases, subsequent tests found DNA from both people on the knife. In others, DNA from only the person who actually touched the knife. And in still others, no DNA was found from the person who actually touched the knife, yet DNA from the other person was found. \n \n Thompson recently testified in a case involving sex toys. Analysts located DNA on the sex toys, Thompson said, in ""quantities comparable"" to that found on JonBenet\'s long johns — but it turned out to have no link to the crime. \n \n ""The DNA came from a person who had carried the wrapped items from the crime scene to a truck to take to the crime lab,"" Thompson said. ""So somebody who had never touched the items, but had touched the exterior of the wrappers of the items, that person\'s DNA was apparently transferred onto the wrappers. Then when the wrapped items got back to the crime lab and were unwrapped, the analyst apparently touched the wrappers and then touched the items, transferring it onto the items — in a way that made it indistinguishable from DNA that would have been deposited there during that crime. \n \n ""So if that can happen in this sexual assault case that I worked on, it\'s easy to imagine similar scenarios that could have gotten the DNA found on JonBenet Ramsey\'s clothing to where it was found. And I think the fact that DNA can be transferred so easily in small quantities is a weakness of the technology at this time."" \n \n \'Can\'t get my arms around that one\' \n \n Lacy established herself as a supporter of the intruder theory in the Ramsey case when she was still Mary Keenan, a chief deputy specializing in sexual assault cases under the man she would soon succeed, then-District Attorney Alex Hunter. \n \n In June 1998, JonBenet\'s parents were questioned at length for the second time — Patsy Ramsey by Denver district attorney\'s investigator Tom Haney and Boulder prosecutor Trip DeMuth, and John Ramsey by retired El Paso County homicide detective Lou Smit and Kane, the attorney who directed the grand jury investigation. \n \n Lacy wasn\'t directly involved in the interrogations. But Haney recalls that after she saw videotape of the interview with Patsy Ramsey, Lacy chided him for being hard on JonBenet\'s mother. \n \n Haney said Lacy volunteering such an opinion seemed odd to him at the time. And, he said in a recent interview, ""It still does."" \n \n Lacy took other steps that left many to believe she ruled out the Ramseys as suspects long before she issued her letter in 2008. \n \n Lacy succeeded Hunter as Boulder County\'s elected district attorney in 2001. It was in that role that, in 2003, she made her first public proclamation on her belief in the Ramseys\' innocence. \n \n A federal judge in Atlanta — in dismissing a libel case filed against the Ramseys by a journalist they named as a potential suspect in their 2000 book ""The Death of Innocence"" — ruled that exhibits in the case led her to believe an intruder was more likely to have killed JonBenet than Patsy Ramsey. \n \n Although Lacy had not been a party to that suit, she nevertheless volunteered a public statement in support of the federal judge\'s ruling, saying, ""I agree with the conclusion that the weight of the evidence is more consistent with the theory that an intruder murdered JonBenet than it is with a theory that Mrs. Ramsey did so."" \n \n After Patsy Ramsey succumbed to ovarian cancer in 2006 following a 13-year battle, she was buried alongside JonBenet in St. James Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta, Ga. Lacy attended her funeral. \n \n Former Boulder police detective Steve Thomas, who had investigated the case in its first years, said that stunned him. \n \n ""I know of no other case in which a sitting district attorney or prosecutor attended the funeral of a person whom she knew a grand jury had voted to criminally indict, and traveled across the country to do so, as Mary Lacy did in the case of Patsy Ramsey,"" he wrote in an email. \n \n ""I can\'t get my arms around that one. I can assure you that many in law enforcement were also distressed by it."" \n \n Thomas quit the investigation in August 1998 over multiple frustrations, including Hunter\'s reluctance at that time to take the case to a grand jury. He later wrote a book about the case and was sued by the Ramseys. That suit resulted in an undisclosed settlement. \n \n \'Culmination of what she wanted\' \n \n Lacy also presided over what is widely seen as one of the greatest debacles in a case marred by numerous missteps: the high-profile 2006 arrest of John Mark Karr, a suspect unearthed by University of Colorado journalism professor Michael Tracey, followed almost immediately by an about-face. \n \n Karr was arrested in Thailand and brought back to Boulder with a sea of photographers recording virtually every moment of his transport — only to be abruptly cut loose a few days after arriving in Colorado when his DNA was found not to match the Unknown Male 1 sample. \n \n Numerous experts have cautioned about the importance of maintaining objectivity, both that of the scientists examining forensic samples, and those who are evaluating the results. They also underscored the importance of severely limiting what is termed contextual information, which is supplied to a laboratory along with items to be tested. \n \n In the case of testing done by Bode Technology for Lacy\'s office, the Bode staff was provided not only a PowerPoint presentation on the case, but a six-page Nov. 7, 2007, letter providing background so extensive that it even made mention that John Ramsey was president of Access Graphics, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary that had just cleared $1 billion in sales at the time of JonBenet\'s murder. \n \n ""Just as they need to make sure that evidence is not physically contaminated, you want to make sure that they\'re not cognitively contaminated, so that they\'re not aware and influenced by irrelevant contextual information that biases how they perceive and interpret the information, the judgments they make,"" said Itiel Dror, senior cognitive neuroscience researcher at University College London. He has presented training at the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Justice and elsewhere on objectivity in forensic examination. \n \n ""The investigators, the lawyers and everybody else need to stay emotionally disconnected from the case as much as humanly possible, so they keep as objective as possible and not fall into a lot of cognitive problems, wishful thinking, self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Dror said. \n \n Grant, the former Adams County district attorney, was skeptical about the Karr arrest at the time as he watched it unfold from a distance. \n \n ""Just listening to him, and seeing the televised interviews, it just struck me as improbable that he had anything to do with it,"" Grant said. \n \n Lacy, he said, ""was one of the folks that was more skeptical of the someone-in-the-house theory from the beginning. When she agreed — I thought, hastily — to bring Mr. Karr back on the flimsiest of non-evidence, it kind of cemented for me that she was looking for some way to bolster the intruder theory."" \n \n And alluding to the exoneration letter of July 2008, Grant said, ""That was the culmination of what she wanted to do all along."" \n \n Not a DNA case \'pure and simple\' \n \n The ramifications for the case in the wake of Lacy\'s letter were considerable, and continue to reverberate to this day. \n \n The day Lacy issued the letter, John Ramsey hailed the news in an exclusive interview with 9NEWS. \n \n ""The most significant thing to me was the fact that we now have pretty irrefutable DNA evidence, according to the DA\'s office,"" Ramsey said. ""And that\'s the most significant thing to me. And certainly we are grateful that they acknowledged that we, you know based on that, certainly could not have been involved. But the most important thing was we now have very, very solid evidence."" \n \n It was first reported by the Camera in January 2013 that the grand jury that heard the Ramsey case from September 1998 to October 1999 had signed indictments against both John and Patsy Ramsey, charging both with child abuse resulting in death. \n \n Hunter declined to file those indictments with the court and prosecute the case at trial. While the standard for filing of charges is that of probable cause, the hurdle for conviction is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and Hunter didn\'t believe the evidence was strong enough for him to do so. \n \n A lawsuit filed against Garnett in September 2013 led to the unsealing the following month of the 1999 indictments, confirming the child abuse charges as well as charges against both parents for accessory to first-degree murder. \n \n But still, the subsequent Lacy exoneration held sway for many, coming, as it did, nearly 10 years later, from the very same office that had secured those indictments. \n \n As recently as September, Wood, the lawyer for the Ramsey family, cited the DNA-based exoneration in a tweet in the wake of national television broadcasts that had raised anew the question of whether someone in JonBenet\'s family was involved in her murder. \n \n ""In 2008, Boulder DA publicly exonerated them and apologized. DNA evidence conclusive. End of story,"" Wood tweeted. \n \n And the same day, Wood tweeted, "" This is a DNA case plain and simple."" \n \n That contention is flatly refuted by the independent experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS. \n \n ""No, it is not,"" Danielson said. ""It\'s clearly not. We have a questioned profile that is very low level in terms of the amount of DNA. The quantity of DNA is very small, the profile is extremely complex. The one thing this case is not, it is not a \'DNA case pure and simple.\'"" \n \n McKee, at the University of Colorado, agreed. \n \n ""I don\'t think any case is just a DNA case. And laboratories across the country operate, and their analysts are trained, not to talk in terms like that,"" said McKee, emphasizing that genetic evidence should be considered an investigative thread that is part of a larger fabric to be considered in its entirety. \n \n ""I think it would be a big mistake to say that, you know, DNA is the only thing that you\'re going to look at,"" McKee said. ""And certainly, in this case, I don\'t think it is the only thing to look at."" \n \n They were echoed by Thompson, the UC-Irvine professor. \n \n ""I would say that the DNA evidence is not conclusive,"" Thompson said. ""I would say that the DNA evidence is indeterminate, leaving us uncertain as to what really happened in this case, and who really killed this little girl."" \n \n Thompson added, ""I mean, wasn\'t there other evidence in this case as well? I heard something about a ransom note, and handwriting analysis, and so on."" \n \n Wood, in an interview, said his tweets were based on Lacy\'s official statements, and on comments by former Boulder police Chief Beckner, made in a Reddit conversation on Feb. 24, 2015. \n \n ""My statements are 100 percent supported by the public statements of the Boulder district attorney and the former Boulder police chief,"" Wood said. ""They\'re almost verbatim."" \n \n But those waiting for nearly 13 years for a match in the CODIS database to the Unknown Male 1 profile could wait forever for something that is never going to happen, Danielson said. \n \n Although the unknown male sample had been entered into CODIS, it has never been matched to any of the other DNA profiles in the system. According to the FBI, as of August that included 12,517,059 offender profiles, 2,462,335 arrestee profiles and 726,709 forensic profiles of unknown individuals, such as the one submitted from the Ramsey case. \n \n One possible answer to the question of why a match has never occurred is that the profile is a composite containing genetic material from multiple people. \n \n ""As I looked at this case, the more I looked, I was just like, \'Oh, OK, that would explain why no database hits,\'"" Danielson said. \n \n A call for new testing \n \n The JonBenet Ramsey investigation remains under the control of the Boulder Police Department, which has been in command of the case since Garnett passed it back to the department\'s detectives when he became DA in 2009. \n \n Revelations about the questioned value of the DNA evidence as it now stands is stirring calls for renewed action on the case. \n \n Owens hesitated to be telling others what should happen now, but said he was unsurprised to have his longtime suspicions that the DNA cited by Lacy could, in fact, be innocently explained — and may even be insignificant to the investigation — confirmed. \n \n ""And it would be very good to hear from Mary Lacy or from others involved, in terms of what this new evidence should show them in terms of where we should go,"" Owens said. \n \n Eid, his former chief counsel who was part of the governor\'s October 1999 case review, hopes it will prod new action in the investigation, possibly employing the latest in DNA technology, which has evolved by quantum leaps since Lacy\'s letter was issued. \n \n No new DNA testing in the Ramsey case has been conducted since 2008. \n \n ""And there ought to be a process to reevaluate this in light of what you have brought forward. That\'s my view,"" Eid said. ""And you shouldn\'t feel locked in because some person who is no longer an elected official made a decision and said something. How many people have said things about this case that turned out to not be very relevant, or very accurate?"" \n \n One important step in the evolution of DNA testing, which was available in 2008 but has matured considerably since then, is known as Y-STR testing, which looks exclusively at male-inherited Y chromosome DNA. \n \n Testing in this manner on key pieces of evidence, such as JonBenet\'s underwear, long johns and perhaps the cord on the garotte used to strangle her or other items associated with the crime scene, would not pick up any of JonBenet\'s genetic markers. That would enable analysts to focus with greater accuracy on only male contributors to the mixed samples. \n \n ""If you are able to ignore, completely, the female contribution, and can focus just on the male, you are able to then get much more robust results,"" McKee said. ""I don\'t really see a reason why it hasn\'t been done, or why you couldn\'t do it."" \n \n Danielson agreed, saying, ""With the Y-STR testing, you eliminate all of the female DNA. So you can amplify male DNA, even if the male DNA is a fraction of 1 percent of the DNA of the females\' on the samples. So that\'s, if I were going to do any additional testing, that\'s the additional testing that I would do. It would help to at least answer some of the questions."" \n \n Grant, the former Adams County district attorney and one-time adviser to Boulder prosecutors, also pointed out that if Lacy truly had faith in the profile on which she based her exoneration, she could have done far more than simply write a letter. \n \n ""A prosecutor can file a John Doe warrant identifying the suspect by that DNA profile,"" Grant said. ""If then-District Attorney Lacy was convinced that that suspect, that DNA profile, was the killer, and she was going to exonerate somebody else, then that\'s what she should have done. \n \n ""The fact that she didn\'t do that tells me something — tells me something about how strong she thinks the DNA evidence may or may not be."" \n \n Garnett expressed faith in the work of the Boulder Police Department, and also said his own office remains committed to doing whatever can be done to solve a case that he sees as still severely compromised by mistakes made in the past. \n \n ""I\'m not going to talk publicly about what we\'re doing or what we would do,"" Garnett said. ""But what I can tell you is that DNA evidence and the theory behind DNA work is changing almost daily, and I have excellent people on staff who review those issues and handle that, and we will make sure that any appropriate testing that can be done to update the theories of the evidence is done."" \n \n Garnett said Lacy\'s 2008 decision was ""legally insignificant"" and ""has no meaning,"" largely due to the fact that the evidence she cited in her letter was never subjected to the rigorous scrutiny and cross-examination that all evidence in any case goes through in a courtroom. \n \n ""None of that happened with the bits and pieces of evidence that was the basis of the exoneration,"" Garnett said. ""And so it\'s just not significant."" \n \n Eid observed that ""it\'s incredible the number of cases that get solved later. And also as DNA testing gets better, it sometimes removes doubt and sometimes adds doubt."" \n \n Eid remains convinced that, ""It\'s not too late for justice."" \n \n Charlie Brennan: 303-473-1327, brennanc@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/chasbrennan \n \n Kevin Vaughan: 303-871-1862, kevin.vaughan@9news.com or twitter.com/writerkev', 'Mary Lacy was one of a team of four who walked through the home of JonBenet Ramsey just days after the 6-year-old beauty contestant was discovered dead in the house\'s basement in Boulder, Colorado, on Dec. 26, 1996. \n \n Interested in Jon Benet Ramsey? Add Jon Benet Ramsey as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Jon Benet Ramsey news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n Just around the corner from JonBenet\'s room on the second floor, an indentation in the carpet was spotted and chills ran down her spine, she told ABC News. ""It was a butt print. We all saw it. The entire area was undisturbed except for that place in the rug,"" Lacy, who was then the chief deputy district attorney heading up the Sexual Assault Unit under Boulder County DA Alex Hunter, said. ""Whoever did this sat outside of her room and waited until everyone was asleep to kill her."" \n \n The apparent presence of that indentation went on to help form a theory that Lacy believes to this day. \n \n The morning after Christmas in 1996, JonBenet was reported missing by her parents after they said a ransom note was found in their home. Her body bound and her mouth covered with duct tape, JonBenet was later discovered in the basement. An autopsy concluded that the cause of death was asphyxiation due to strangulation. The coroner\'s report stated that a blunt object had hit her so hard, there was an 8-inch fracture to her tiny skull. The report also showed some damage to JonBenet\'s hymen, indicating possible sexual assault. \n \n John and Patsy Ramsey, as well as JonBenet\'s brother, Burke Ramsey, were the only other people known to be in the house at the time of the slaying, and for years after her death, they were each trailed by a cloud of suspicion. John and Patsy Ramsey were at one point considered persons of interest in the case by authorities. \n \n But in 2008, Lacy -- who by then had been named Boulder County DA and taken over the investigation -- surprised even some of the most seasoned of her fellow prosecutors by exonerating the family. \n \n Now, for the first time in eight years, the former prosecutor is speaking out to ABC News about her decision to clear the Ramsey family as her exoneration letter has now come under scrutiny following a joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and Denver\'s KUSA-TV/9News. \n \n Helen Davis/AP Photo \n \n \'Trying to Prevent a Horrible Travesty of Justice\' \n \n Former Adams County DA Bob Grant, one of a number of consultants on the case brought in early on by the Boulder County DA at the time, Hunter, told ABC News he was confounded by Lacy\'s 2008 decision. ""This is craziness,"" he said. ""This is not what prosecutors do. If prosecutors are going to exonerate someone they do it by charging someone else."" \n \n But Lacy didn\'t charge anyone else in the murder. Instead, armed with newly discovered DNA evidence found on JonBenet\'s long johns that Lacy said she believes belongs to JonBenet\'s unknown murderer, she sent the Ramseys a letter of apology. It read, in part, ""to the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry."" The letter made international news. \n \n The DNA evidence was discovered after Lacy sent the long johns to Bode Cellmark Forensics to be tested for touch DNA. She had attended a seminar in the summer of 2007 that explained the relatively new process. She felt it could advance the seemingly stalled case, she said. \n \n Some Boulder Police Department detectives who had long worked on the investigation and still considered the Ramseys persons of interests were furious. \n \n ""Here’s what I was doing with the exoneration letter,"" Lacy explained. ""I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice. I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track."" \n \n In the 2008 letter, Lacy hung her hat on newly discovered touch DNA found on JonBenet\'s long johns, which she said was found to belong to an unknown male. Lacy argued that this unknown male DNA matched DNA found in two spots of blood in the crotch of JonBenet\'s panties. The unknown male DNA, reasoned Lacy, was the smoking gun that pointed to JonBenet\'s killer and that killer was not anyone in her family. Family members and 200 other potential suspects were excluded from the unknown male DNA found on the panties and long johns, she said. \n \n Lacy\'s theory? When the Ramseys left to have Christmas night dinner with friends, they left the front door unlocked, and a male intruder simply walked inside and waited for hours for the family to come home. During that time, Lacy believes, he wrote the rambling two-and-a-half page ransom note. \n \n That note referenced several lines from movies. ""The Boulder police should have checked all of the video stores to see who was renting those movies and they never did,"" said Lacy. \n \n However, the Boulder Daily Camera\'s investigation published Thursday found the DNA results in the Bode report are not necessarily as clear cut as Lacy concluded they were. According to the Daily Camera, they showed the Bode report to independent experts who say that the DNA samples from both the underwear and long johns may be composite samples from multiple people: JonBenet, an unknown male and, in one sample, a third unidentified person. To the extent composites were used in the search to identify the killer, the investigation states that the DNA profile ""may be worthless as evidence."" According to the paper, the possible presence of a third individual\'s DNA on the long johns has never been publicly revealed. \n \n The experts also stated that the presence of the DNA on JonBenet\'s undergarments could have an innocent explanation because the ""profiles were developed from minute samples that could have been the result of inconsequential contact with other people or transferred from another piece of clothing."" \n \n According to the paper, these opinions ""cut both ways"" on the competing theories of the case. They neither disprove the intruder theory nor ""implicate or exonerate anyone in the family."" \n \n When asked about the impending Daily Camera report ahead of its publication Thursday, Lacy said she has taken criticism for her decision to write the exoneration letter in the past. ""I\'ve withstood worse than this,"" she said. ""And it\'s nothing compared to what the Ramsey family has gone through targeted as suspects in their own daughter\'s murder."" Lacy has not responded to ABC News\' request for comment since the Daily Camera report was published. \n \n Is JonBenet\'s Murder a DNA Case or Not? \n \n There have been conflicting views over whether the mystery of JonBenet\'s murder can be solved by DNA alone. \n \n Former Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner, who headed up the department from 1998 to 2014, said in an ""Ask Me Anything"" session on Reddit last year that the investigation considered the DNA important, but that there was other crucial evidence in the case that couldn\'t be ignored. \n \n ""Mary Lacy, the DA who said the DNA exonerated them, made up her mind years before that a mother could not do that to a child, thus the family was innocent,"" Beckner wrote. \n \n Stan Garnett, the current Boulder County DA, told ABC News that no case is ever solely reliant on DNA. ""DNA is a part of the case,"" he said. ""But you have to account for everything else. There were problems with crime scene, you have the ransom note ... you have debates about the cause of death -- to solve this case we have to account for all of that."" \n \n But forensic pathologist Lawrence Kobilinsky with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who has not worked on the case but who reviewed a summary of the Bode report put together by Boulder County investigator Andy Horita prior to the publication of the Daily Camera report, told ABC News that ignoring the unknown male DNA would be a huge mistake. ""This is definitely a DNA case,"" he said. Kobilinsky said the markers found on the long johns are not enough of a profile to ""match"" those found in the panties, as Lacy wrote in her letter exonerating the Ramseys, but he would describe the markers from both the long johns and the panties as being ""consistent"" and noted that the DNA does belong to an unknown male. ""Lacy did the right thing [in clearing the Ramsey family],"" he said. \n \n When questioned about hanging her hat on the DNA in her exoneration letter, Lacy said that she only did that because the DNA was ""something tangible people could understand."" The truth is, she said, she cleared the Ramseys not just based on the DNA, but also from looking at the totality of the evidence. \n \n ""There was no motive [for the parents], and no psychopathy,"" Lacy said. She added that she is one of only two people who have read the entire transcripts of Patsy Ramsey\'s psychiatric interviews, in which Lacy said she saw no indication of jealousy toward JonBenet or any violent tendencies. In 2006 when Patsy Ramsey was dying of cancer and even on her deathbed, Lacy said the distraught mother was trying to solve the death of her daughter. \n \n Lacy, who was the Boulder County DA from 2001 until 2009, said the Boulder police investigation had ignored important evidence that pointed away from the Ramseys and instead focused on them while ""trying to get the death penalty."" \n \n ""They were running around the country looking for something negative on that family,"" Lacy said. But the Ramseys, she said, were clean. \n \n The case is currently cold, but Boulder police say they are continuing to investigate any lead that comes in. It\'s recently attracted new attention this fall as the 20th anniversary of JonBenet\'s death approaches, and police have received hundreds of new tips. \n \n Ed Andrieski-Pool/Getty Images \n \n A Lacy \'Apology Tour\' \n \n People who worked with Lacy remember her bringing John Ramsey into the Boulder County prosecutor\'s office around the time she exonerated the family. ""She wanted us all to shake hands with him. We didn\'t know what to say ... it was like an apology tour,"" said one of Lacy\'s former DA investigators, Gordon Coombes. \n \n Coombes, who worked in the Boulder prosecutor\'s office from 2008 to 2011, said he feels Lacy got too close to the family and lost her objectivity. ""It was understood that if you didn\'t fall in line with the intruder theory, you were out,"" he said. \n \n Another investigator who worked under Lacy, Ruth Aten-Shearwood, who is now a social worker in England, said that apart from a tight network of advisers, Lacy did not allow other investigators to work on the Ramsey case. Aten-Shearwood said she found out about the exoneration letter from watching the news. Said Aten-Shearwood, ""I had to pick my jaw up off the floor."" \n \n Garnett, the current Boulder County DA, is running unopposed for his third term. Of Lacy\'s exoneration letter, he said, ""This letter is not legally binding. It\'s a good-faith opinion and has no legal importance but the opinion of the person who had the job before I did, whom I respect."" \n \n When asked about the Ramseys, he said, ""They, like everyone else, are presumed innocent. There\'s not enough admissible evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to charge anyone with this crime."" \n \n The Ramseys have always maintained their innocence. Burke Ramsey, now 29, recently filed a $150 million defamation suit against a forensic pathologist who claimed he was involved in the murder on CBS’ ""The Case of: JonBenet Ramsey."" Burke\'s attorney, Lin Wood, told ABC News that Burke was falsely accused of being responsible for the death of his sister. \n \n Wood told ABC News he has tremendous respect for Lacy and the work she did during her time as DA. ""This was a one-side, unfounded and brutal attack on Lacy who served well the citizens of Boulder for eight years,"" he said of the Daily Camera report. \n \n Later, he added that he is encouraged that the DNA is being called into question because ""now maybe all of those other suspects who were excluded will have to be reinvestigated."" \n \n Lacy told ABC News she stands by her decision to exonerate the Ramseys, insisting that ""if the evidence had been there [to prosecute them], I\'d have gone for it.""']",2,"– After just short of 20 years, the murder of JonBenet Ramsey is as much of a mystery as ever—especially in light of a new examination of DNA evidence. A joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9News calls into question former District Attorney Mary Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramsey family. At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from ""Unknown Male 1"" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus ""worthless as evidence,"" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of ""inconsequential contact with other people,"" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, ""I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,"" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.) ""I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track."" Comparison to the DNA profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects. (JonBenet's older brother is suing a pathologist who accused him of the killing.)"

Mr Stumpf has so far ignored calls for him to step down. \n \n \'Deeply sorry\' \n \n During the hearing by a panel of US senators on 20 September, Mr Stumpf said he was ""deeply sorry"" for that and failing to act quickly. \n \n ""There is no question with some of our customers we violated trust,"" he said. ""We never directed nor wanted our team members to provide products and services to our customers that they didn\'t want. \n \n ""That said, I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices,"" he added. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n During the questioning, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has long been a critic of the US banking industry, was unmoved by his apology. \n \n ""You squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers,\'\' she said. \n \n ""You should resign. You should give back the money you took while the scam was going on,"" she added. \n \n Record fine \n \n Wells Fargo said it would be contacting every deposit customer across the country to see if their accounts were properly authorised. \n \n It will also contact hundreds of thousands of customers with open credit cards to see if they want or need those cards. \n \n In the future, confirmation emails will be sent to customers within one hour of the opening of a new deposit account. \n \n The fine imposed on the bank by the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was the largest ever imposed by the regulator.', 'Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf will forfeit much of his 2016 salary -- including his bonus and $41 million in stock awards -- as the bank launches a probe into its phony accounts scandal. \n \n The fallout from the controversy has also resulted in its first major executive departure. Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the division that created the fake accounts, has left the company ahead of her scheduled retirement at year end. \n \n Wells Fargo, under pressure from lawmakers and shareholders to take action, said Tolstedt will not receive a bonus or severance, and that she\'ll forfeit all of her $19 million worth of unvested stock awards. Wells Fargo also said Tolstedt has agreed not to exercise some $34 million in stock options, the bank\'s independent directors announced Tuesday. \n \n However, Tolstedt could still be walking away with a fortune despite running the retail bank during the entire time the unauthorized accounts were opened. \n \n Tolstedt owns roughly $43.3 million in stock outright that she accumulated during her career with the bank, according to a letter Wells Fargo sent to Senator Elizabeth Warren. That means if she is allowed to keep her stock options, Tolstedt could leave Wells Fargo with stocks and options valued today at roughly $77 million. \n \n Related: Wells Fargo fake accounts head could still walk with $77 million \n \n Wells Fargo\'s board of directors also said Tuesday that it\'s launching an independent investigation into the company\'s sales practice. The new probe comes as employees told CNNMoney that the practice of opening fake accounts began years earlier than Wells Fargo has previously acknowledged. \n \n During the company\'s investigation, Stumpf will work for free. \n \n Stephen Sanger, the board\'s lead independent director, said the executives could face further penalties, depending on the results of the investigation. \n \n He said in a statement that the board may claw back additional compensation or take ""other employment-related actions."" It\'s not clear if that could include forcing out Stumpf, who Warren and others have demanded should resign. \n \n If they\'re cleared of wrongdoing, both Stumpf and Tolstedt may end up taking home some of their hefty pay packages. \n \n The decision to ""claw back"" Stumpf\'s and Tolstedt\'s compensation comes just before Thursday\'s big Wells Farg (WFC)hearing in front of the House Financial Services Committee and amid a string of embarrassing headlines about the opening of unauthorized accounts. \n \n Wells Fargo paid Stumpf $19.3 million in total compensation for 2015, in part as a reward for the bank\'s growing number of accounts. Millions of those accounts, as it\'s been since revealed, were fake. An intense focus from top management on adding new accounts, former employees say, led to a pressure-cooker atmosphere at Wells Fargo. \n \n Related: Fired Wells Fargo workers fight back with lawsuit \n \n Last year, Stumpf was awarded with $4 million for various factors that included growing ""primary consumer, small business and banking checking customers."" Wells Fargo also rewarded Stumpf last year for his success in ""reinforcing a culture of risk management and accountability across the company."" \n \n That bonus led Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an authority on corporate governance at Yale University, to say that ""without a doubt"" some of Stumpf\'s pay should be clawed back. ""He should be docked,"" Sonnenfeld said. \n \n A CNNMoney analysis, conducted prior to the clawbacks, showed that if he were to leave, Stumpf could leave Wells Fargo with about $200 million of cash, Wells Fargo stock and options. \n \n Last week, Warren slammed Stumpf for ""gutless"" leadership, in part for his refusal to cut compensation for Tolstedt, who led Wells Fargo\'s community banking division during the entire time fake accounts were created. \n \n Warren also came down heavy on Stumpf on his own pay: When it all blew up, you kept your job, you kept your multimillion dollar bonuses, and you went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich.""', 'The longtime chief executive of Wells Fargo agreed on Tuesday to forfeit $41 million in performance pay three weeks after the bank acknowledged that for at least five years, thousands of low-level employees set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. \n \n The San Francisco-based bank has repeatedly apologized for the scheme and said it had fired 5,300 employees for misconduct and put in place more stringent internal controls. But that has not been enough for lawmakers, who have been pushing for the company’s top leaders to give back the millions of dollars in bonuses they earned while the irregularities were occurring. \n \n The independent directors of the Wells Fargo board announced Tuesday that they were launching an investigation into the bank’s retail business. \n \n “We are deeply concerned by these matters, and we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Company’s business are conducted with integrity, transparency, and oversight,” Stephen Sanger, the lead independent director, said in a statement. Sanger, who has been a member of Wells Fargo’s board since 2003, is the former chairman of General Mills, the packaged-food company. \n \n John Stumpf, the chief executive, will forfeit unvested stock awards worth about $41 million, will not receive a salary while the investigation is underway and will not be eligible for a 2016 bonus, the committee said in a statement. Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of Wells Fargo’s community banking unit, where the misconduct took place, will give up $19 million in unvested stock awards and not be eligible for a 2016 bonus. Tolstedt had announced her retirement in July but had initially planned to stay at the bank until the end of the year. \n \n In a tense exchange, Senator Elizabeth Warren badgered Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf on why he had not offered to give up any of his compensation or to resign in the wake of the fake accounts controversy. (Reuters) \n \n Stumpf and Tolstedt still have millions of dollars in stock and other compensation from Wells Fargo. Stumpf, for example, was awarded $161 million in bonuses and performance awards between 2011 and 2015, the period in which the misconduct took place, according to Equilar, a research firm. Tolstedt was awarded more than $60 million in bonuses in the same period. \n \n But this action by the bank’s board is, by far, the most aggressive and public effort by a bank since the 2008 financial crisis to show that top executives will be held responsible for their companies’ misdeeds. \n \n In early September, Wells Fargo was fined $185 million by regulators after it discovered that thousands of employees were setting up unauthorized accounts, including credit cards and checking accounts, that customers had not requested. In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. \n \n The case has sparked a national outcry, with lawmakers pummeling Stumpf before the Senate Banking Committee last week, with one even calling on him to resign. He is to be the only witness before the House Financial Services Committee when he attends a hearing this week, and the move to take back financial awards could help head off some of the inevitable anger of lawmakers. \n \n The debate comes as regulators try to finalize rules called for by the 2010 financial-reform bill, known as Dodd Frank, to overhaul the way Wall Street executives are paid and to address years of complaints that excessive bonuses helped lead to the 2008 financial crisis. \n \n The long-awaited rules were aimed at stopping executives from making risky financial bets to boost their pay and then collecting large bonuses before the consequences of their actions are clear. But the banking industry is mounting a counterattack against the rules, which critics say do not allow enough flexibility. Some employees would be subject to claw-backs for up to 11 years after being awarded bonuses, much longer than the current industry standard of three to five years, industry officials have said. \n \n In July, Wells Fargo joined the debate, saying it was concerned that the rules may have unintended consequences. “We have worked, and are continuing to work, diligently . . . to improve and evolve our incentive-based compensation practices,” Hope Hardison, Wells Fargo’s director of human resources, said in a letter to regulators. \n \n But the rules would “create an un-level playing field, driving high-quality talent” away from big banks subject to the rules, she wrote. \n \n The controversy surrounding Wells Fargo is likely to make it more difficult for banks to mount efforts to weaken the rules, industry officials say. \n \n Stumpf is expected to face tough questioning when he appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. In addition to questions about executive compensation, he is likely to face questions about a recently launched Labor Department inquiry into the bank. \n \n The Labor Department says it is conducting a “top-to-bottom review” of Wells Fargo after lawmakers complained that the bank’s workers were forced into a hypercompetitive environment that led thousands of them to set up the sham accounts to meet aggressive sales goals. \n \n Some former employees allege that they were unfairly fired when they did not cut corners to meet Wells Fargo’s aggressive sales targets. \n \n That could violate federal rules, according to lawmakers and some labor experts. Last week, former Wells Fargo employees who say they were fired for following the law filed a $2.6 billion lawsuit against the bank. They are seeking class-action status. \n \n The Labor Department said it has set up a working group to expedite a review of the issue. \n \n “Given the serious nature of the allegations . . . I have directed enforcement agencies within the Department to conduct a top-to-bottom review of cases, complaints, or violations concerning Wells Fargo over the last several years,” Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a letter released Tuesday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had asked the agency to look into the matter. \n \n “We take the concerns raised . . . very seriously,” Perez wrote. \n \n A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the Labor Department review. \n \n It is just the latest sign that San Francisco-based bank will be grappling with the fallout from this case for some time. Federal prosecutors are considering civil or criminal charges against the bank.']",3,"– John Stumpf, the Wells Fargo CEO slammed for his ""gutless leadership"" by Sen. Elizabeth Warren last week, is going to have to tighten his belt a little this year: He will forfeit his bonus, part of his salary, and $41 million in stock awards over the fake-account scandal that saw the sacking of 5,300 employees, CNN reports. In addition, Stumpf will work for free while the company conducts an investigation. The bank's board of directors also says Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the retail division where workers created the phony accounts, will forfeit at least $19 million of the $125 million she was going to leave the company with at the end of the year, and will not receive severance or a bonus for 2016. The announcement comes as Wells Fargo is set to go before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. The board says it is launching an independent investigation into how millions of accounts were created without the permission of customers, the BBC reports. Wells Fargo was fined $185 million over the scandal and the Washington Post describes the board's cash clawback as ""by far the most aggressive and public effort"" since the 2008 financial crisis to punish bank chiefs for misconduct—although Stumpf still has the estimated $161 million he received in bonuses over the five years the scam took place, and Tolstedt received $60 million over the same period. (Wells Fargo whistleblowers say they were fired for speaking out.)"
213,"['Primo, a New Orleans Police K-9 in 2004. Matt Rose / The Times-Picayune / Landov ID: 5874049 \n \n By the time Officer Jason Lewis of the New Orleans Police Department returned to his police SUV, his K-9 — a six-year-old Belgian Malinois named Primo — was battling for his life. While Lewis got ready for his shift, he had left the dog inside the police vehicle. As the temperature inside the SUV rose on that hot May day in 2009, Primo tore, clawed, and bit into the upholstery on the seats — apparently trying to escape to cooler air. His body temperature spiked far above normal for a dog, to almost 110 degrees. When Lewis returned to the vehicle he saw Primo “lying in the back coughing.” The officer hosed down the dog then rushed him to a local veterinary clinic, where the dog subsequently collapsed, suffered three seizures, and died. Cause of death: “shock due to heat stress.” ID: 5876273 \n \n Interior of the police SUV after the officer found Primo “lying in the back coughing.” Metropolitan Crime Commission ID: 5874081 \n \n Primo is one of more than two dozen police K-9s that were left in vehicles and have died of heat-related symptoms since 2007. The animal rights group PETA identified 20 deaths; BuzzFeed News confirmed those and found another nine, based on local and national news reports. Untold numbers of pets die because they are left in cars, but the deaths of police dogs can be particularly heartrending because they, like uniformed officers, put their lives on the line. And these dogs don’t need to die. New technology can warn handlers who’ve left their K-9s in cars. “It is a painful, horrible death,” said Justine Lee, a veterinary specialist in emergency critical care and toxicology for nearly 20 years. “Once a dog’s temperature goes above 105 or 106 degrees, their cells start dying, and they can start going into seizures or have mass organ failure.” With the exception of their paws, dogs lack the sweat glands that humans have on their skin. The main way dogs cool themselves is panting. Lee said that since police dogs are usually German shepherds or Belgian Malinois, with thicker coats and darker hair, they are more susceptible to heat stroke than other breeds. Ike, a Department of Corrections K-9 in Phoenix, died last year after being left in the back of a police vehicle for seven hours after an officer forgot about him. Two police K-9s — Vegas and Hades — perished after they were left in a police vehicle for nearly 30 hours in Bexar County, Texas, in 2012. Again, their officer said he forgot he left them in the kennel portion of the specially equipped police vehicle. (A spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Corrections said that the department installed “a motion-sensing alarm system to help prevent similar accidents from occurring,” while a spokesperson for the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office said it had initiated “extra measures to help ensure incidents like this don’t happen again.”) The vast majority of such K-9 deaths occur in local police forces, but dogs also sweltered to death while in vehicles belonging to airport police, corrections departments, and other types of law enforcement agencies. Forgetting the dog in the car is one problem, but some handlers intentionally put their dog in the vehicle, mistakenly trusting the air-conditioning system to keep running for hours. In a particularly ghastly case, police K-9 Sasha was found in her handler’s SUV after three hot August days in Warwick, Georgia. Lt. T.J. Frye, Sasha’s K-9 handler, told investigators the dog must have made it into the vehicle on her own, according to a local Atlanta TV station WSB. Sasha’s final moments in the car were eerily similar to Primo’s. Both dogs apparently tried to chew through the car to escape. After Frye found Sasha’s bloated and decomposing body in the vehicle, he buried the eight-year-old Dutch shepherd in his backyard. Local residents and city officials expressed shock and grief, demanding that the dog receive a proper burial. An online petition for an investigation into the dog’s death received more than 4,000 signatures. Officer Frye resigned from the force a week after the dog’s death. The Warwick Police Department referred comment to its lawyer, Tommy Coleman, who said the department has “tried to put in place procedures” to prevent such deaths. “When you have public \u200bofficers who serve in the capacity of, basically, a trustee of the public, and they cause the death of an animal who had been charged with serving the same community, most people get really charged,” said Scott Heiser, director of the Criminal Justice Program at the Animal Legal Defense Fund. “These dogs are a voiceless class, much like kids, and they are at that compete mercy of their handlers\u200b.” Across America, there are at least 20,000 working police dogs, said Rick Ashabranner, president of the North American Police Work Dog Association. “Probably 95% of dogs stay with their handler and their family,” said Ashabranner, who worked with a police narcotics dog for 22 years. “It’s no different than owning a pet. The bond is so tight that when they die it’s like losing a family member.” No one knows how many police dogs die annually in hot cars. No federal agency keeps track. The Connecticut Police Work Dog Association tallies K-9s that died in service from all causes. The organization has tallied more than 2,000 K-9 deaths since 1940 from agencies including the Navy, Border Patrol, and local police. K-9s who died of excessive heat because they were left in vehicles are not listed explicitly, but some of those deaths can be found on the website under the category of “Heat Exhaustion.” The 29 deaths confirmed by BuzzFeed News occurred in 14 states from North Carolina to California, and only between April and September. Even on mild summer days, closed vehicles act like a greenhouse. When it’s 85 degrees outside, one study found that in 20 minutes, the temperature inside a car can rise almost to 114°F — almost 30 degrees. After an hour, the inside temperature can hit a scorching 128 degrees. ID: 5876279 \n \n This is how quickly a car can heat up Courtesy Jan Null, CCM; Department of Meteorology and Climate Science, San Jose State University ID: 5874202 \n \n According to historical temperature data, New Orleans hit a high of 88 degrees on May 27, 2009, the day Primo died. In an hour, according to the study, the black-haired dog would have been in temperatures nearing 130 degrees. By comparison, the hottest temperature ever recorded in the United States was 134 degrees in Death Valley, California. Officer Lewis told investigators that he had left the air conditioner on in the vehicle when he left Primo, according to a story in the Times-Picayune. A subsequent police investigation found no wrongdoing, but the district attorney charged Officer Lewis with aggravated cruelty to animals, a felony. Lewis later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor animal cruelty charge. He was ordered to pay $11,500 to the police department. After almost three years, a court of appeals found that Lewis was not negligent, and reinstated the officer with full pay and benefits. “There’s a huge controversy that he got off,” said Jeff Dorson, the executive director of the Humane Society of Louisiana. “It’s hard to know the truth, but the evidence shows that the dog did die of heat exhaustion, according to the necropsy report. And the fact that he [Lewis] plead guilty originally, what does that tell you?” A spokesman for the NOPD confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Lewis was reinstated to the force but no longer works with a K-9 Unit. The NOPD declined a request to interview Lewis. A 2012 federal consent decree mandated 15 specific changes to how the NOPD handles its K-9s, including “improvements to handler control of canines, personnel changes, and equipment procedures.” “By working in conjunction with the federal consent decree monitor, NOPD has put new and more stringent policies, training and procedures in place for both the dogs and their handlers,” said the department in response to questions by BuzzFeed News. The deaths of Primo, Hades, Vegas, Sasha, and other dogs were preventable. Many police K-9 units use heat alert systems sometimes known as “Hot Dog” or “Hot-N-Pop” systems. The technology varies, but if the vehicle’s interior gets too hot, the alert system automatically rolls down the windows, activates a cooling system or fan, and sets off the vehicle’s siren. According to an investigation by San Antonio’s ABC affiliate, KSAT 12, the Bextar County Sheriff’s Office bought two Hot Dog systems prior to the death of police K-9s Hades and Vegas, but “sat in boxes, untouched on a training room floor for over a year.” It is unclear why the systems, which were bought from a $27,000 grant, were not installed, the article states. A spokesman for the Bextar County Sheriff’s Office emailed BuzzFeed News that Hades and Vegas died “during a previous administration” and that the department has since taken new measures to prevent such deaths. He also wrote that “k9s are considered partners and the loss of them is tremendous for those who interact with them.” Since 2010, the NOPD has installed Hot-N-Pop systems inside every vehicle in the department, according to the NOPD’s statement to BuzzFeed News. “I’ve had those systems installed; I know how well they work,” said Jason Purgason, a former K-9 supervisor with the Reidsville Police Department in North Carolina for 10 years. A Hot Dog system typically costs $500–$1,000 per vehicle. “In the grand scheme of things, those systems are inexpensive,” said Purgason, now a training director for Highland Canine Training in North Carolina. The cost of procuring a police K-9 can vary greatly, but is generally expensive. The Glendale Police Department in Los Angeles County puts the figure around $20,000. The purchase of a dog alone is around $8,000. The additional cost of training of the dog for patrol, detection, and tracking is another $12,000. Total costs including outfitting a vehicle designed to carry a K-9 easily surpass $50,000 — and that figure does not include yearly training maintenance, veterinary care, and food. PETA plans to send letters to K-9 law enforcement organizations around the country urging them to install Hot Dog systems in all vehicles. “No dog should endure a needless, agonizing death while locked in a hot car, and a heat-alert system would be an easy fix,” the statement reads. The beginnings of the modern police dog can be found with the establishment of the first formal police dog training program in Belgium in 1899. Today, K-9s help track fugitive and missing persons, and they detect narcotics and explosives. Last September, as summer was drawing to a close in Montville Township, Ohio, two-year-old Beny was left in a patrol vehicle for more than fours hours, the windows rolled up, while Sgt. Brett Harrison filled out paperwork inside the police station, according to a local report. After Beny’s death, Sgt. Harrison wrote an apology to the township trustees. “Most of all, I want to say I’m sorry to my partner, friend and loving family member Beny. I wish everyday that I could go back and change that day or that I could put myself in your place. You will always be in my heart and I will miss you every second of every day,” Harrison wrote. Sgt. Harrison was given a two-week unpaid suspension, and 40 hours of his vacation time were taken away. Harrison was found guilty of one count of companion animal cruelty in March. Sgt. Harrison and the Montville Police Department did not respond to requests to comment. ID: 5876324 \n \n Police K-9 Beny.

But a new analysis of 619 deaths since 2011 by the Green Bay Press-Gazette raises that number to at least 46 dogs, with 18 others succumbing to heatstroke during other activities (e.g., training exercises, being tethered outside in the sun), putting heatstroke as the No. 1 cause of police dog deaths for non-medical reasons. Failures in the cars' AC or other equipment were factors in 19 of the 46 cases, while officer negligence was blamed in 26. One especially egregious case in 2013 involved 10 US Customs and Border Protection dogs who died after the AC failed. ""Those dogs were essentially in an oven,"" a rep said at the time. ""You don't have to be an animal lover to be sick about this."" It's unclear exactly how many police dogs die this way, since agencies don't have to report it, the Press-Gazette notes; instead, stats are typically culled from memorial websites and other sources. ""It is a painful, horrible death,"" a veterinary specialist told BuzzFeed. Departments are taking measures including replacing faulty heat-alarm units, mounting fans in car windows, and inspecting AC units more regularly. But advocates say it comes down to human diligence. ""It's not a matter of changing policy,"" the director of a Wisconsin canine handler group tells the Press-Gazette. ""Check on your dog."" An Animal Legal Defense Fund director puts it in harsher terms: ""An officer who allows a dog to die of heat exhaustion on duty is as neglectful as leaving a service revolver on a school playground.""

An autopsy has not been completed. \n \n According to initial accounts by the Baltimore County police department, officers were responding to a 911 call placed by Boyd’s girlfriend, Deona Styron. But a lawyer for Boyd’s family, Latoya Francis-Williams, told a different story. She said Boyd called 911 himself because he was feeling disoriented and needed an ambulance. \n \n “They really were supposed to be there to get him to the nearest healthcare facility,” Francis-Williams said. \n \n After being questioned on the discrepancy, the police department updated its account, saying: “Police originally thought the girlfriend was the caller because the information passed on to police from the dispatcher said ‘female yelling on the phone’.” \n \n According to the police incident report: “The call stated that there is a female yelling in the background. 911 added that a female keeps saying ‘Tell them hurry up’.” \n \n Boyd repeatedly asked officers to enter his home, the report said, and asked a neighbor to call the police. Boyd told officers that Styron, who lived with him, “got him intoxicated and is secretly recording him while someone else is in the home”. The author of the police report described Boyd as “confused and paranoid”. Boyd asked officers to go into the house and find out who was inside. \n \n According to the report, Boyd attempted to enter two police cars and then ran to a neighbor’s house and banged on the door, calling: “Help! Call the police!” \n \n “It was obvious suspect Boyd was under the influence of a narcotic and/or suffering [REDACTED] and needed to be taken to the hospital for emergency evaluation,” the report noted. \n \n By the time medics loaded Boyd into the back of an ambulance, he reportedly had physical injuries imposed by officers. \n \n The report does not describe Boyd as violent or threatening, saying Boyd seemed to scratch the author’s neck and accidentally kick another officer, named Garland, “while trying to stand”. Boyd grabbed a third officer’s face, the report said, describing his hand slipping down to the officer’s badge and microphone. That officer, Bowman, “delivered two closed fist strikes to the suspect’s face with his right fist”. \n \n Francis-Williams said: “He is literally attacked. And by attacked, I mean the witness [Styron] is describing that he [was] struck many times and struck to the ground. \n \n “Officer Bowman is the one that when he arrived, really started wailing on Mr Boyd, meaning Mr Boyd was on the ground in a prone position and Bowman sat on him, almost straddled his back, and put his left arm under Boyd’s neck and pulled his head up in a choking fashion.” \n \n This is not too far from the language used in the incident report, which says “officers were able to get him under control by using our body weight to keep him on the ground. Officer Bowman controlled Suspect Boyd’s head and arms by holding him down with his arms while [the report author] held Suspect Boyd down by leaning on his buttocks/thigh area with my knees and using my arms.” \n \n Boyd’s grandmother, Linda Burch, told the Baltimore Sun: “I kept telling them stop before they hurt him because I told them they could kill him like that.

The report noted that the “medics advised that the suspect did have a heartbeat prior to being transported”. \n \n The report ends with a redacted list of minor injuries sustained by the officers. Boyd ended up in intensive care. \n \n Though an autopsy has not been released, Francis-Williams said there was “swelling on the brain and fluid on the brain because the doctors attempted to drain that. \n \n “My understanding is his kidneys end up failing and at some point, his heart stops,” she said. \n \n Police officials said the autopsy report could take as long as a month to complete.', 'Baltimore County police and fire officials are investigating the circumstances behind the death of 21-year-old Tawon Boyd, who died Wednesday, three days after police struggled with him while responding to a disturbance call. \n \n A medic who was called to the scene gave Boyd medication to calm him down. Autopsy results are a critical component in this case, because they might reveal whether the drug haloperidol, which sources said medics gave the victim to calm him down, contributed to his death.

215,"['CTVNews.ca Staff \n \n \n \n \n \n Nearly 30 years after his disappearance, a Kitchener, Ont., man solved his own cold case when he suddenly remembered his identity. \n \n Edgar Latulip was 21 years old when he vanished from the southern Ontario city. \n \n But this Wednesday, Waterloo Regional Police confirmed he was found roughly 130 kilometres away in St. Catharines, Ont., and is doing well. \n \n It was revealed that Latulip had suffered a head injury shortly after arriving in the city years ago and ""effectively forgot who he was."" \n \n But in January of this year, Latulip told a social worker in St. Catharines that he remembered his name, putting the gears in motion for his return home. \n \n At the time of his disappearance, police believed Latulip, who has a developmental delay, took a bus and travelled to the Niagara Falls area. Even though they were on the right track, they were unable to find him. \n \n Years later, police were tipped off that he may have been spotted in Hamilton, Ont., but they still could not track him down. \n \n ""It\'s the only case, that I know of, where we\'ve been able to find someone who has been missing for this period of time,"" Det. Const. Duane Gingerich, of the Waterloo Regional Police, told CTV Kitchener. \n \n Police say a DNA test on Friday confirmed his identity and a reunion with his family is in the works. \n \n ""I did speak with one of the family members yesterday and today, and … they\'re obviously very happy about it, and they’re making plans to get together with Edgar and speak with him further,"" said Gingerich. \n \n Latulip\'s mother, Silvia Wilson, said she is overwhelmed by her son\'s return, but she hasn’t spoken with him yet. \n \n With a report from CTV Kitchener\'s Allison Tanner', 'On the campus of the University of Missouri, graduate student Jonathan Butler has been starving himself in an effort to remove the school’s president Tim Wolfe from his position. Today, on the seventh day of his protest, Butler won. \n \n Butler’s protest was never a solitary one—he is the face of a student group calling itself Concerned Student 1950—but the speed with which it metastasized and engulfed the university had to have surprised Wolfe. \n \n Butler and his allies were, broadly speaking, protesting the treatment of minority (primarily black) students on Missouri’s campus. Butler said that he would not eat until Wolfe—the president of the University of Missouri System, which encompasses both the flagship campus in Columbia as well as smaller colleges across the state—resigned his position. Wolfe, even in the face of growing attention and pressure, as the story became a national one, had refused to do so. On Sunday he stood his ground in a statement, but by then, his position had clearly become untenable. \n \n \n \n On Saturday night, the black members of the school’s football team announced that they would not practice nor play until Wolfe was no longer the school’s president, and Butler had resumed eating. On Sunday, the team’s coach, Gary Pinkel, released a statement saying that his coaching staff and team were united, and would not participate in any football activities until Wolfe resigned or was removed. That was going to include the team’s next game, on Saturday, against Brigham Young University, which is scheduled to air on an ESPN network. \n \n At Missouri, an SEC school, football is big business. Pinkel, the coach, makes $4 million per year; Wolfe, the president, made less than $500,000. The football program institutionally supporting its black players protesting along with Butler was probably this situation’s greatest possible escalator—it’s what made Butler’s protest into a topic of coverage for ESPN—but the players, too, weren’t acting alone. A group of teachers called the Concerned Faculty Group announced this morning that they would be conducting a two-day walkout in support of Butler and Concerned Student 1950. The school’s student government also released a statement this morning demanding Wolfe’s resignation. State legislators, including Columbia’s representative and the chairman of the state House’s Committee on Higher Education, both of whom are Republicans, also called on Wolfe to resign. Wolfe was under attack from just about every conceivable side, and despite his obstinacy, his resignation was not a question of “if,” but “when.” \n \n So, what brought us here? It’s perhaps easiest to work backwards. On October 10, during the school’s annual homecoming parade, Butler and other members of Concerned Student 1950 blockaded the vintage convertible that was carrying Wolfe. According to witnesses, the driver of the convertible revved the car’s engine while it was stopped before eventually bumping into Butler. The group was also heckled by parade attendees. Wolfe was reportedly silent during the protest. \n \n Butler began his hunger strike in response to Wolfe, over the subsequent month, refusing to acknowledge that demonstration or the reasons for which it was carried out. The aim of the homecoming parade protest was to draw attention to what Butler and Concerned Student 1950 say is an inhospitable campus climate for minorities. In a letter announcing his hunger strike, Butler referenced several incidents: \n \n On September 12, student body president Payton Head wrote on Facebook that he had been called a “nigger” while walking through campus. It was not the first instance, and the school’s Legion of Black Collegians say the slur was also used against them while they were rehearsing a play outdoors on October 5. In his Facebook post, Head also wrote about the on-campus oppression faced by LGBT, disabled, Muslim and female students. \n \n On October 24, a swastika was drawn in feces on the bathroom wall of a residence hall. \n \n In September, the university announced it was removing the hospital privileges of Colleen McNicholas, a doctor who performed abortions at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia. Per the Kansas City Star, state law dictates that “a doctor can only perform abortions if he or she has clinical privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where the abortions are taking place.” The school’s decision effectively ended abortion in Columbia. \n \n Earlier in the fall semester, the school announced that it was revoking health insurance subsidies for graduate students. After an immediate backlash, the policy was reversed. \n \n Though these were the recent incidents that sparked the protest that led to Wolfe’s resignation, the oppression felt, and indignities suffered, by minority students and faculty did not, of course, begin just this semester. Cynthia Frisby, a professor at the school’s historic and loudly trumpeted journalism school, has lived in Columbia for 18 years. She wrote in a Facebook post that she had “been called the n word too many times to count.” She also wrote specifically of several disturbing incidents of racism: \n \n Some of you may recall my most recent experience while jogging on Route K in May of 2015 when I was approached by a white man in a white truck with a confederate flag very visible and proudly displayed. He leaned out his window (now keep in mind I run against traffic so his behavior was a blatant sign that something was about to happen). Not only did he spit at me, he called me the n-word and gave me the finger. Of course, I responded with “Oh yea, get out of your car you coward and say that to my face.” He then raced off. Typical. Others of you may recall that after the Zimmerman trial, I wrote about my experiences being called the n word twice while I was on my jog. And yes, I have had a few faculty call me the n word and treat me with incredible disrespect. Yes, faculty. I have had a student who said he couldn’t call me Dr. Frisby because that would mean that he thinks I am smart and he was told that blacks are not smart and do not earn degrees without affirmative action. Yes, true story. I have so many stories to share that it just doesn’t make sense to put them all here. \n \n In my final year as a student at Mizzou, cotton balls were thrown onto the lawn of the Black Culture Center, which is centrally located on campus, during Black History Month. In 2011, a racial slur was spray painted onto a statue outside a residence hall. In 2012, racist flyers were posted in another dorm. \n \n In the wake of the graffiti incident, the school launched a “diversity initiative” called One Mizzou, which then-chancellor Brady Deaton called his “proudest moment.” But One Mizzou, as a concept and a name, was discontinued this summer at the behest of the students who it was supposed to benefit. A campaign that was initially supposed to promote tolerance and inclusion on campus had morphed into a generic marketing slogan for the school itself. The baby steps had led nowhere. \n \n The co-opting and eventual euthanizing of One Mizzou were emblematic of a simple fact that is as true in Columbia as it is in America: The University of Missouri, and the community in and around it, were aware of, and attentive to, the experiences of its minority students only in the worst of moments. When asked to confront and address the commonplace indignities minority students experience at his university during the homecoming parade—a celebration, not a crisis—Wolfe, the ostensible leader of that community, had no response. He will be gone, though not forgotten—certainly not by his peers, who may now find themselves asked to acknowledge, and fix, problems they didn’t know existed. \n \n [image via AP]']",2,"– Almost 30 years after he went missing from a group home in Kitchener, Ontario, at the age of 21, Edgar Latulip remembered something very important last month: his name. Police say the 50-year-old, who has a developmental delay and functions at a child's level, has spent the last 30 years living in St. Catharines, around 80 miles from where he disappeared, CTV reports. From what investigators can piece together, Latulip took a bus to Niagara Falls in September 1986 and ended up in St. Catharines, where he suffered a head injury and ""effectively forgot who he was"" until this year, when he told a social worker he remembered. Before his disappearance, Latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself. Police officer Duane Gingerich, who investigated the disappearance, tells the Guelph Mercury that he's thrilled that Latulip has turned up alive. ""I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,"" he says. ""For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It's satisfying because most of these cases don't turn out this way. You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time."" A DNA test confirmed Latulip's identity and police say a reunion with his mother, who moved to Ottawa years ago, is being arranged. In a 2014 interview, she told the Mercury she was still haunted by the disappearance. ""This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure,"" she said.

219,"['Senior U.S. commanders argued that increasing electricity through the “Kandahar Bridging Solution” would be an important part of the overall American military effort to beat back the Taliban in Kandahar province. Those commanders asserted that more power to operate lights, television sets and fans would please residents and lead many of them to throw their support behind the Afghan government. \n \n But other civilian and military officials have questioned that logic. When U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl was the deputy commander of U.S. forces in Kandahar last year, he said he could not find any evidence that the additional electricity was yielding greater employment, stability or support for the government. “This is a bridge to nowhere,” he declared to his staff in 2011. \n \n Back then, Dahl also noticed a disturbing disparity: The installation of the turbine at the dam, which will not occur for at least two more years, will produce significantly less power than the city receives from the generators. Since the Afghan government will not have the financial ability to buy diesel for the generators, that means the city’s power supply will inevitably ebb once the turbine is operational and U.S. funding for diesel ends. \n \n That gap was seized upon by the inspector general. “While the Kandahar Bridging Solution may achieve some immediate [counter\xadinsurgency] benefits because — as stated by USAID officials — ‘people like having their lights on,’ the U.S. government may be building an expectations gap that cannot be met in a timely manner,” the report states. \n \n The inspector general’s report also questions whether a new $23 million road in Helmand province will have adverse effects because the Afghan government has not compensated landowners for the destruction of their property. In addition, the report reveals that four electricity projects — costing a total of more than $300 million from the infrastructure fund — have not yet been awarded to contractors, despite claims from the military and USAID that they will have important counterinsurgency benefits. \n \n Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a frequent critic of Afghan reconstruction efforts, said the report raises fundamental questions about the strategic rationale of U.S. development programs in the war-torn nation. “There’s no data that shows these major projects have changed the security environment in the country,” she said. “We cannot just throw money at a country like this and expect it to have a good ending.” \n \n In its response to the report, the U.S. Embassy defended the importance of large-scale development initiatives. “These critical infrastructure projects have signaled to Afghan populations the U.S. government’s long term commitment to Afghanistan.” \n \n Although the United States has spent almost $90 billion on Afghan reconstruction and development over the past decade, such examinations traditionally had not been conducted by the special inspector general’s office, which was more interested in contracting waste and fraud. This report was approved by a new inspector, former federal prosecutor John F. Sopko, who took charge of the office this month. He has vowed to scrutinize how projects are conceptualized and designed, not just how they are implemented.', 'A U.S. initiative to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on construction projects in Afghanistan, originally pitched as a vital tool in the military campaign against the Taliban, is running so far behind schedule that it will not yield benefits until most U.S. combat forces have departed the country, according to a government inspection report to be released Monday. \n \n The report, by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, also concludes that the Afghan government will not have the money or skill to maintain many of the projects, creating an “expectations gap�? among the population that could harm overall stabilization efforts. \n \n “Implementing projects that the Afghan government is unable to sustain may be counter\xadproductive�? to the U.S. counterinsurgency mission, the inspector general wrote. “If goals are set and not achieved, both the U.S. and Afghan governments can lose the populace’s support.�? \n \n The study calls into question a fundamental premise of the U.S. strategy to counter the Taliban insurgency — that expensive new roads and power plants can be funded and constructed quickly enough to help turn the tide of war — and it poses a sobering, counterintuitive question for policymakers in Washington: whether the massive influx of American spending in Afghanistan is actually making problems worse. \n \n Many U.S. military commanders, diplomats and reconstruction experts have long believed that large infrastructure projects were essential to fixing Iraq and Afghanistan. Now-retired Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former top commander in both wars who is now director of the CIA, used to say that cash was one of his most important weapons. \n \n But the latest report adds new weight to the argument — voiced by independent development specialists and even a few government officials — that the United States attempted to build too much in a country with limited means to assume responsibility for those projects. All U.S. combat forces are expected to be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. \n \n Until now, most critiques have asserted only that the massive U.S. foreign assistance program has led to waste and fueled corruption. The new report goes further by suggesting that some projects may ultimately prove detrimental. \n \n In a written response to the report, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it was “speculative�? for the inspector general to conclude that some of the projects would have adverse effects. The top Pentagon official responsible for Afghanistan called the report premature and insisted that the announcement of the projects, even though they have not been completed, has generated goodwill and excitement among the Afghan people. \n \n The inspector general’s examination focuses on the Afghan Infrastructure Fund, which was authorized by Congress in 2010 in part to prevent the Defense Department from dipping into a discretionary account for military commanders to bankroll large projects. The infrastructure fund was supposed to allow the Defense and State departments to collaboratively plan and pool money for large infrastructure improvements aimed at supporting the U.S. counter\xadinsurgency campaign. \n \n Since then, Congress has poured $800 million into the fund and the State Department has committed about $1 billion of its funds to related infrastructure programs. \n \n Among the projects criticized by the inspector general is a plan to use costly diesel generators to provide electricity to residents of Kandahar, the country’s second-largest city, until the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers install a new hydropower turbine at a dam in the violence-plagued hills of neighboring Helmand province. Purchasing diesel to run the generators, which produce about 25 megawatts of electricity each — enough to power about 2,500 Afghan homes or small businesses — is projected to cost U.S. taxpayers about $220 million through 2013. \n \n Senior U.S. commanders argued that increasing electricity through the “Kandahar Bridging Solution�? would be an important part of the overall American military effort to beat back the Taliban in Kandahar province. Those commanders asserted that more power to operate lights, television sets and fans would please residents and lead many of them to throw their support behind the Afghan government. \n \n But other civilian and military officials have questioned that logic. When U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl was the deputy commander of U.S. forces in Kandahar last year, he said he could not find any evidence that the additional electricity was yielding greater employment, stability or support for the government. “This is a bridge to nowhere,�? he declared to his staff in 2011. \n \n Back then, Dahl also noticed a disturbing disparity: The installation of the turbine at the dam, which will not occur for at least two more years, will produce significantly less power than the city receives from the generators. Since the Afghan government will not have the financial ability to buy diesel for the generators, that means the city’s power supply will inevitably ebb once the turbine is operational and U.S. funding for diesel ends. \n \n That gap was seized upon by the inspector general. “While the Kandahar Bridging Solution may achieve some immediate [counter\xadinsurgency] benefits because — as stated by USAID officials — ‘people like having their lights on,’ the U.S. government may be building an expectations gap that cannot be met in a timely manner,�? the report states. \n \n The inspector general’s report also questions whether a new $23 million road in Helmand province will have adverse effects because the Afghan government has not compensated landowners for the destruction of their property. In addition, the report reveals that four electricity projects — costing a total of more than $300 million from the infrastructure fund — have not yet been awarded to contractors, despite claims from the military and USAID that they will have important counterinsurgency benefits. \n \n Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a frequent critic of Afghan reconstruction efforts, said the report raises fundamental questions about the strategic rationale of U.S. development programs in the war-torn nation. “There’s no data that shows these major projects have changed the security environment in the country,�? she said. “We cannot just throw money at a country like this and expect it to have a good ending.�? \n \n In its response to the report, the U.S. Embassy defended the importance of large-scale development initiatives. “These critical infrastructure projects have signaled to Afghan populations the U.S. government’s long term commitment to Afghanistan.�? \n \n Although the United States has spent almost $90 billion on Afghan reconstruction and development over the past decade, such examinations traditionally had not been conducted by the special inspector general’s office, which was more interested in contracting waste and fraud. This report was approved by a new inspector, former federal prosecutor John F. Sopko, who took charge of the office this month. He has vowed to scrutinize how projects are conceptualized and designed, not just how they are implemented.', 'MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — Liberia\'s president late Wednesday ordered the nation\'s schools to shut down and most civil servants to stay home as an Ebola outbreak that already has killed more than 130 people in the country deepened. \n \n Meanwhile, the U.S. Peace Corps said it was evacuating its volunteers from Liberia as well as neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone as the regional death toll topped 670 people. The Ebola outbreak is now the largest recorded in history. \n \n President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is skipping a summit of African leaders in Washington this week amid the crisis, also called for the closure of markets in an area near the borders with infected countries Guinea and Sierra Leone. \n \n ""My fellow Liberians, Ebola is real, Ebola is contagious and Ebola kills,"" she warned. ""Denying that the disease exists is not doing your part, so keep yourselves and your loved ones safe."" \n \n Fear and panic over the mounting death toll has prompted some rural communities to accuse foreign aid workers of bringing the deadly virus. Others have kept people with Ebola symptoms at home instead of bringing them to quarantine centers. In anger, one man recently set fire to part of the health ministry building in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, after his teenage brother reportedly died of Ebola. \n \n Sirleaf said that security forces would enforce the new precautions taken a week after an American man of Liberian descent boarded a plane in Monrovia and flew to Nigeria, where authorities said he died of Ebola. The fact that he was able to board a plane and traveled through a major airport transit hub in Togo has only heightened fears about Ebola\'s possible spread in the region. \n \n The airline involved, ASKY, has suspended its flights to both the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, and said passengers departing from Guinea would be carefully screened. \n \n Ebola has no vaccine and no specific treatment, with a fatality rate of at least 60 percent. But experts say the risk of travelers contracting it is considered low because it requires direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions such as urine, blood, sweat or saliva. Ebola can\'t be spread like flu through casual contact or breathing in the same air. \n \n Patients are contagious only once the disease has progressed to the point they show symptoms, according to the World Health Organization. The most vulnerable are health care workers and relatives who come in much closer contact with the sick. \n \n Still, Liberia is among the poorest countries in the world, and the outbreak already has taxed the capacity of local health clinics and doctors, prompting concern for those who remain in the country. \n \n In a statement released Wednesday, the Peace Corps said that 340 volunteers in the three affected countries were being evacuated and ""a determination on when volunteers can return will be made at a later date."" \n \n Two U.S.-based missionary groups also have ordered the evacuation of their non-essential personnel from Liberia after a doctor and a missionary both contracted Ebola. \n \n SIM USA President Bruce Johnson announced Tuesday that his group and Samaritan\'s Purse decided on the evacuation following an upsurge in the number of Ebola cases in Liberia. A Texas-trained doctor and a missionary from North Carolina have contracted the disease and are in isolation in Liberia. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal contributed to this report.']",3,"– When US inspectors looked at four border police bases in Afghanistan—funded by the US at a cost of almost $19 million—they found most of the facilities on three of those bases had either been abandoned or weren't being used as intended, the Wall Street Journal reports. The report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a US government watchdog agency, uncovered numerous examples of poor construction work: One base has no water supply, a second is experiencing sewage overflow, some are missing drainpipes, others have leaking fuel lines or broken doors. One even includes a well house being used as … a chicken coop. The US Army Corps of Engineers says it is working on fixing the issues. The report also finds that the US plan to fund hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects in the country is extremely behind schedule—and that some of the ambitious plans may actually hurt the country, the Washington Post adds. The report raises concerns about the 2014 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and questions whether local forces are prepared to take over security duties—and whether this new infrastructure can be successfully maintained by a country with limited resources. The Post digs into a $220 million electricity project in Kandahar that it cites as a prime example."

But the city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material. \n \n ""I\'m leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen,"" said Luke Ridley, 23, from London as he sat at Narita international airport using his laptop. \n \n ""I\'ll probably come back in about a month."" \n \n Though there has been alarm around the world, experts have been warning there is little risk of radiation at dangerous levels spreading to other nations. \n \n The U.S. government said ""minuscule"" amounts of radiation were detected in California consistent with a release from Japan\'s damaged facility, but there were no levels of concern. \n \n Amid their distress, Japanese were proud of the 279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage, wearing masks, goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape. \n \n ""My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are doing,"" Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan\'s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters. \n \n G7 INTERVENTION FOR YEN \n \n The Group of Seven rich nations succeeded in calming global financial markets in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen. \n \n The dollar surged to 81.98 yen on Friday after the G7 moved to pour billions into markets buying dollars, euros and pounds -- the first such joint intervention since the group came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000. \n \n The dollar later dropped back to under 81 yen, but it was still far from the record low of 76.25 yen hit on Thursday. \n \n ""The only type of intervention that actually works is coordinated intervention, and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in Japan,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York. \n \n Japan\'s Nikkei share index ended up 2.7 percent, recouping some of the week\'s stinging losses. It lost 10.2 percent for the week, wiping $350 billion off market capitalization. \n \n The plight of the homeless worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the worst-affected areas. \n \n Nearly 290,000 households in the north were still without electricity, officials said, and the government said about 940,000 households lacked running water. \n \n Aid groups say most victims are getting help, but there are pockets of acute suffering. \n \n ""We\'ve seen children suffering with the cold, and lacking really basic items like food and clean water,"" Stephen McDonald of Save the Children said in a statement on Friday. \n \n (Additional reporting by Linda Sieg, Nathan Layne, Elaine Lies, Leika Kihara, Jon Herskovitz, Joseph Radford and Chris Gallagher in Japan; Fiona Ortiz in Madrid; Scott DiSavino in New York; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Robert Birsel)', 'YAMAGATA, Japan -- Emergency workers seemed to try everything they could think of Thursday to douse one of Japan\'s dangerously overheated nuclear reactors: helicopters, heavy-duty fire trucks, even water cannons normally used to quell rioters. But they couldn\'t be sure any of it was easing the peril at the tsunami-ravaged facility. \n \n (SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES) \n \n Three reactors have had at least partial meltdowns, but an even greater danger has emerged. Japanese and U.S. concerns were increasingly focusing on the pools used to store spent nuclear fuel: Some of the pools are dry or nearly empty and the rods could heat up and spew radiation. \n \n It could take days and ""possibly weeks"" to get the complex under control, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens, a much stronger measure than Japan has taken. \n \n A senior official with the U.N.\'s nuclear safety agency said there had been ""no significant worsening"" at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant but that the situation remained ""very serious."" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and in a third they were also not completely submerged. \n \n If the fuel is not fully covered, rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns that would release much larger amounts of radioactive material than the failing plant has emitted so far. \n \n Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis triggered by last week\'s earthquake and tsunami has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo\'s normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. \n \n President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide, and said he was asking for a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear plant safety. \n \n Japanese and American assessments of the crisis have differed, with the plant\'s owner denying Jazcko\'s report Wednesday that Unit 4\'s spent fuel pool was dry and that anyone who gets close to the plant could face potentially lethal doses of radiation. But a Tokyo Electric Power Co. executive moved closer to the U.S. position Thursday. \n \n ""Considering the amount of radiation released in the area, the fuel rods are more likely to be exposed than to be covered,"" Yuichi Sato said. \n \n Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Unit 3\'s reactor and cooling pool. \n \n Two Japanese military CH-47 Chinook helicopters began dumping seawater on Unit 3 on Thursday morning, defense ministry spokeswoman Kazumi Toyama said. The choppers doused the reactor with at least four loads of water in just the first 10 minutes, though television footage showed much of it appearing to disperse in the wind. \n \n Chopper crews flew missions of about 40 minutes each to limit their radiation exposure, passing over the reactor with loads of about 2,000 gallons (7,500 liters) of water. Another 9,000 gallons (35,000 liters) of water were blasted from military trucks with high-pressure sprayers used to extinguish fires at plane crashes, though the vehicles had to stay safely back from areas deemed to have too much radiation. \n \n Special police units with water cannons were also tried, but they could not reach the targets from safe distances and had to pull back, said Yasuhiro Hashimoto, a spokesman for Japan\'s nuclear safety agency. \n \n Unit 3\'s reactor uses a fuel that combines plutonium, better known as an ingredient in nuclear weapons, and reprocessed uranium. The presence of this mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, means potentially that two very harmful radioactive products could be released into the environment. \n \n Tokyo Electric Power said it believed workers were making headway in staving off a catastrophe both with the spraying and, especially, with efforts to complete an emergency power line to restart the plant\'s own electric cooling systems. \n \n ""This is a first step toward recovery,"" said Teruaki Kobayashi, a facilities management official at the power company. He said radiation levels ""have somewhat stabilized at their lows"" and that some of the spraying had reached its target, with one reactor emitting steam. \n \n ""We are doing all we can as we pray for the situation to improve,"" Kobayashi said. Authorities planned to spray again Friday, and Kobayashi said: ""Choices are limited. We just have to stick to what we can do most quickly and efficiently."" \n \n Work on connecting the new power line to the plant was expected to begin Friday and take 10 to 15 hours, said Nuclear Safety Agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don\'t, electricity won\'t help. \n \n Four of the plant\'s six reactors have seen fires, explosions, damage to the structures housing reactor cores, partial meltdowns or rising temperatures. Officials also recently said temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other two reactors. \n \n The troubles at the nuclear complex were set in motion by last Friday\'s 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out power and destroyed backup generators needed for the reactors\' cooling systems. That added a nuclear crisis on top of twin natural disasters that likely killed well more than 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. \n \n Mario V. Bonaca, a physicist sits on an advisory committee to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes the focus of the effort has shifted to the spent fuel pools. ""I understand that they\'ve controlled the cooling of the cores,"" said Bonaca, who said he was basing his understanding on NRC and industry sources. \n \n The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. \n \n While a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating in and out of the complex to avoid exposure, experts said that anyone working close to the reactors was almost certainly being exposed to radiation levels that could, at least, give them much higher cancer risks. \n \n Experts note, though, that radiation levels drop quickly with distance from the complex. While elevated radiation has been detected well outside the evacuation zone, experts say those levels are not dangerous. \n \n U.S. officials were taking no chances. In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. \n \n The first flight left Thursday, with fewer than 100 people onboard, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy said. Plans also call for airlifting several thousand family members of U.S. armed forces personnel as well as nonessential staff stationed in Japan in the coming days. \n \n The U.S. evacuation zone is far bigger than that established by Japan, which has called for a 12-mile zone and has told those within 20 miles to stay indoors. Daniel B. Poneman, U.S. deputy secretary of energy, said at the briefing that his agency agreed with the 50-mile zone - but said Japan\'s measures were also prudent. \n \n Nearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami, police said more than 452,000 people were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. \n \n Noriko Sawaki lives in a battered neighborhood in Sendai that is still without running water and food or gasoline supplies and that, she said, makes life exhausting. ""It\'s frustrating, because we don\'t have a goal, something to strive for. This just keeps on going,"" said the 48-year-old. \n \n In the town of Kesennuma, people lined up to get into a supermarket after a delivery of key supplies, such as instant rice packets and diapers. \n \n Each person was only allowed to buy 10 items, NHK television reported. \n \n With diapers hard to find in many areas, an NHK program broadcast a how-to session on fashioning a diaper from a plastic shopping bag and a towel.', 'Smoke billowed from a building at Japan\'s crippled nuclear power plant Friday as emergency crews worked to reconnect electricity to cooling systems and spray more water on overheating nuclear fuel at the tsunami-ravaged facility. \n \n ALTERNATE CROP OF TOK870 OF MARCH 17, 2011 - In this photo taken on Wednesday afternoon, March 16, 2011 and released on Thursday, March 17 by Tokyo Electric Power Co.

(Associated Press) \n \n Four of the troubled Fukushima Dai-ichi plant\'s six reactor units have seen fires, explosions or partial meltdowns in the week since the tsunami. While the reactor cores where energy is generated are a concern, water in the pools used to store used nuclear fuel are also major worries. Water in at least one fuel pool _ in the complex\'s Unit 3 _ is believed to be dangerously low, exposing the stored fuel rods. Without enough water, the rods may heat further and spew out radiation. \n \n ""We see it as an extremely serious accident,"" Yukiya Amano, the head of the U.N.\'s International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Friday just after arriving in Tokyo. ""This is not something that just Japan should deal with, and people of the entire world should cooperate with Japan and the people in the disaster areas."" \n \n Frantic efforts were made Thursday to douse a number of units with water, and authorities were preparing to repeat many of those efforts. \n \n Friday\'s smoke came from the complex\'s Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said. An explosion had hit the building on Tuesday, possibly damaging a crucial cooling chamber that sits below the reactor core. \n \n Last week\'s 9.0 quake and tsunami in Japan\'s northeast set off the nuclear problems by knocking out power to cooling systems at the reactors. The unfolding crises have led to power shortages in Japan, forced auto and other factories to close, sending shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices. \n \n Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo\'s normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. \n \n The Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, even as the troubles have multiplied. In a country where the nuclear industry has a long history of hiding its safety problems, this has left many people _ in Japan and among governments overseas _ confused and anxious. \n \n ""I feel a sense of dread,"" said Yukiko Morioka, 63, who has seen business dry up at her lottery ticket booth in Tokyo. ""I\'m not an expert, so it\'s difficult to understand what\'s going on. That makes it scarier."" \n \n A senior official with the U.N. nuclear agency said Thursday there had been ""no significant worsening"" at the nuclear plant but that the situation remained ""very serious."" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and they were also not completely submerged in a third. \n \n Edano said Friday that Tokyo is asking the U.S. government for help and that the two are discussing the specifics. \n \n ""We are coordinating with the U.S. government as to what the U.S. can provide and what people really need,"" Edano said. \n \n At times, the two close allies have offered starkly differing assessments over the dangers at Fukushima. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said Thursday that it could take days and ""possibly weeks"" to get the complex under control. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile (80-kilometer) evacuation zone for its citizens, wider than the 30-mile (50-kilometer) band Japan has ordered. \n \n Crucial to the effort to regain control over the Fukushima plant is laying a new power line to the plant, allowing operators to restore cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., missed a deadline late Thursday but said Friday that workers hoped to complete the effort in 10 to 15 hours, said nuclear safety agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. \n \n But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don\'t, electricity won\'t help. \n \n The official death toll from the disasters stood at 6,405 as of Friday morning, with 10,259 missing, the national police agency said. \n \n President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide. \n \n A utility official said Wednesday that the company has been unable to get information such as water levels and temperatures from any of the spent fuel pools in the four most troubled reactors. \n \n Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Units 3 and 4. \n \n On Thursday, military helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water from huge buckets onto Unit 3, and also used military firefighting trucks normally used to extinguish fires at plane crashes. \n \n Officials announced Friday they would not continue with the helicopter drops _ televised footage appeared to show much of that water blowing away _ but would continue spraying from the trucks. \n \n Police said more than 452,000 people made homeless by the quake and tsunami were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. \n \n At the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating out of the complex to minimize radiation exposure. \n \n The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. \n \n In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. \n \n ___ \n \n Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo. Associated Press writers George Jahn in Vienna, Elaine Kurtenbach, Shino Yuasa, Jeff Donn and Tim Sullivan in Tokyo contributed to this report.', ""While the findings were reassuring in the short term, the United States declined to back away from its warning to Americans there to stay at least 50 miles from the plant, setting up a far larger perimeter than the Japanese government had established. American officials did not release specific radiation readings. \n \n American officials said their biggest worry was that a frenetic series of efforts by the Japanese military to get water into four of the plant’s six reactors — including using water cannons and firefighting helicopters that dropped water but appeared to largely miss their targets — showed few signs of working. \n \n “This is something that will likely take some time to work through, possibly weeks, as eventually you remove the majority of the heat from the reactors and then the spent fuel pool,” said Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission , briefing reporters at the White House. \n \n The effort by the Japanese to hook some electric power back up to the plant did not begin until Thursday and even if they succeed, it is unclear whether the cooling systems, in reactor buildings battered by a tsunami and then torn apart by hydrogen explosions, survived the crisis in good enough shape to be useful. \n \n “What you are seeing are desperate efforts — just throwing everything at it in hopes something will work,” said one American official with long nuclear experience who would not speak for attribution. “Right now this is more prayer than plan.” \n \n On Thursday, President Obama said that the crisis had convinced him to order the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do a comprehensive review of the safety of nuclear plants in the United States. \n \n After a day in which American and Japanese officials gave radically different assessments of the danger from the nuclear plant, the two governments tried on Thursday to join forces. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Experts met in Tokyo to compare notes. The United States, with Japanese permission, began to put the intelligence-collection aircraft over the site, in hopes of gaining a view for Washington as well as its allies in Tokyo that did not rely on the announcements of officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates Fukushima Daiichi. \n \n American officials say they suspect that the company has consistently underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage. \n \n Aircraft normally used to monitor North Korea’s nuclear weapons activities — a Global Hawk drone and U-2 spy planes — were flying missions over the reactor, trying to help the Japanese government map out its response to last week’s 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the tsunami that followed and now the nuclear disaster. \n \n President Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Japanese Embassy to sign a condolence book, writing, “My heart goes out to the people of Japan during this enormous tragedy.” He added, “Because of the strength and wisdom of its people, we know that Japan will recover, and indeed will emerge stronger than ever.” \n \n Later, he appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House to offer continued American support for the earthquake and tsunami victims, and technical help at the nuclear site. \n \n Video \n \n But before the recovery can begin, the nuclear plant must be brought under control. On Friday, steam that was likely laced with radioactive particles was again rising over the plant, this time billowing from reactor No. 2, which suffered an explosion Tuesday. But Japanese authorities said they did not yet know the cause of the latest release. \n \n American officials, meanwhile, remained fixated on the temperature readings inside that reactor and two others that had been operating until the earthquake shut them down, as well as at the plant’s spent fuel pools, looking for any signs that their high levels of heat were going down. If the fuel rods are uncovered and exposed to air, they heat up and can burst into flames, spewing radioactive elements. \n \n So far the officials saw no signs of dropping temperatures. And the Web site of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations nuclear watchdog, made it clear that there were no readings at all from some critical areas. Part of the American effort, by satellites and aircraft, is to identify the hot spots, something the Japanese have not been able to do in some cases. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Made for quick assessments of radiation emergencies, the Aerial Measuring System is an instrument system that fits on a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft to sample air and survey the land below. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Daniel B. Poneman, the deputy secretary of energy, said at a White House briefing on Thursday that preliminary results of the initial flights “are consistent with the recommendations that came down from the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,” which led to the 50-mile evacuation guideline given to American expatriates. Although the worst contamination is closer to the plant, the recommendation takes into account the possibility of shifting winds or greater emissions. \n \n The State Department has also said it would fly out of the country any dependents of American diplomats or military personnel within the region of the plant and as far south as Tokyo. Space will be made for other Americans who cannot get a flight, it said. \n \n Getting the Japanese to accept the American detection equipment was a delicate diplomatic maneuver, which some Japanese officials originally resisted. But as it became clear that conditions at the plant were spinning out of control, and with Japanese officials admitting they had little hard evidence about whether there was water in the cooling pools or breaches in the reactor containment structures, they began to accept more help. \n \n The sensors on the instrument pod are good at mapping radioactive isotopes, like cesium 137, which has been detected around the nuclear plant and has a half-life of 30 years. In high doses, it can cause acute radiation sickness . Lower doses can alter cellular function, leading to an increased risk of cancer . \n \n Cesium 137 can enter the body through many foods, including milk. \n \n On Wednesday, when the American Embassy in Tokyo, on advice from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Americans to evacuate a radius of “approximately 50 miles” around the Fukushima plant, the recommendation was based on a specific calculation of risk of radioactive fallout in the affected area. \n \n In a statement, the commission said the advice grew out of its assessment that projected radiation doses within the evacuation zone might exceed one rem to the body or five rems to the thyroid gland. That organ is extremely sensitive to iodine 131 — another of the deadly byproducts of nuclear fuel, this one causing thyroid cancer . \n \n The commission says that the average American is exposed to about 0.62 rem of radiation each year from natural and manmade sources. \n \n The American-provided instruments in Japan measure real levels of radiation on the ground. In contrast, scientists around the world have also begun to draw up forecasts of how the prevailing winds pick up the Japanese radioactive material and carry it over the Pacific in invisible plumes. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Private analysts said the United States was also probably monitoring the reactor crisis with spy satellites that can spot the heat from fires — helping it independently assess the state of the reactor complex from a distance. \n \n Jeffrey G. Lewis, an intelligence specialist at the Monterey Institute, a research center, noted that the Japanese assessment of Reactor No. 4 at the Daiichi complex seemed to depend in part on visual surveillance by helicopter pilots. \n \n “I’ve got to think that, if we put our best assets into answering that question, we can do better,” he said in an interview. \n \n One main concern at No. 4 has been a fire that was burning there earlier in the week; American officials are not convinced that the fire has gone out. \n \n American officials have also worried that the spent-fuel pool at that reactor has run dry, exposing the rods. Japanese officials, however, have concentrated much of their recent efforts on Reactor No. 3, which has been intermittently releasing radiation from what the authorities believe may be a ruptured containment vessel around the reactor. Temperatures at that reactor’s spent fuel pool are also high. \n \n Perhaps because of the difficulties experienced Thursday trying to accurately drop water from helicopters, the Japanese military announced Friday that it was halting those efforts for at least a day.""]",4,"– Japan is considering burying its troubled nuclear plant in sand and concrete—the same move made in Chernobyl 25 years ago, Reuters reports. “It is not impossible to encase the reactors in concrete. But our priority right now is to try and cool them down first,” said an official, as authorities work to restore power. Smoke has been rising from the No. 2 reactor at the plant, and authorities aren’t sure of the cause—though it may be linked to the explosion there Tuesday, notes the AP. New damage has been discovered in the fuel pool at the plant’s No. 4 reactor, hampering cooling efforts to refill it with water (click for more on the alarming situation). US data-collecting flights suggest that radiation hasn’t expanded outside a 19-mile area—but Japan has raised its threat level from 4 to 5 out of 7, pointing to danger that extends beyond the local. The crisis could continue for weeks, said a US official. Meanwhile, the Huffington Post notes, authorities are using every cooling method available, from fire trucks to water cannons."
224,"['As an 18-year-old man ran from his New Smyrna Beach house bleeding from four gunshot wounds, his father stepped outside, pointed a handgun and fired one more shot, police said. \n \n Eugene Blackwell Sr. shot his son Eugene Blackwell Jr. at 6:34 p.m. on Father’s Day while the two were inside their Edward Street home, New Smyrna Beach Sgt. Eugene Griffith said. \n \n The final shot missed the fleeing teen. \n \n The younger Blackwell, who just graduated from New Smyrna Beach High where he was a star weightlifter, had just broken up a fight between his father and his mother, Windy Blackwell, Griffith said, and the elder Blackwell was not pleased with the interference. \n \n “He shot his son four times,” Griffith said Monday morning. “It escalated after the mother left the house.” \n \n The elder Blackwell was arrested early Monday and charged with attempted first-degree murder. He was being held without bail Monday at the Volusia County Branch Jail. \n \n Neighbor Richard Tredeaux told investigators that after he heard the initial gunfire coming from the Blackwell house, he saw Blackwell Jr. running from the residence. Tredeaux said he saw Blackwell Sr. emerge from the home and point something at the teenager. He heard another gunshot and then the elder Blackwell yelled out, “Yeah (expletive deleted) how do you like that?” the arrest report states. \n \n Griffith said Blackwell Jr. was airlifted to Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach in critical condition. He was listed in satisfactory condition on Monday, said Tangela Boyd, hospital spokeswoman. \n \n Sgt. Griffith said Blackwell Jr. interrupted his parents when their argument turned physical early Sunday evening. According to the arrest report, Blackwell Sr. grabbed his wife by the neck after he asked her whether she had been talking to a man named “Frank.” \n \n Windy Blackwell, 42, told police the family had a pleasant Father’s Day. She told police her husband then went out to visit a friend and that when he returned he started asking her about “Frank.” Windy Blackwell denied talking to anyone named “Frank,” but did tell her husband that she wants a divorce, the report states. She said her husband grabbed her by the throat and that’s when her son intervened, the report shows. \n \n Windy Blackwell said her husband has been abusive throughout their 23-year relationship and that he has been abusive with their son, the report states. Court records show Blackwell Sr. has been arrested several times on charges of battery and domestic violence. He was convicted of battery in 1992. There are two other children in the family, but Windy Blackwell said they were not home when the fight erupted. \n \n The mother told police that Blackwell Jr. told her to leave the house. After she left reluctantly, Blackwell Sr. turned on his son, Griffith said. When the mother returned to the residence a few minutes later, though, she learned that her son had been shot and that he was being taken to the hospital. She talked to Blackwell Jr. before he was taken away and he told her that he was fine, the report states. \n \n Blackwell Sr. had taken off in his Dodge pickup, police said. Another neighbor, Justin Drury, told police that he saw the elder Blackwell speed away in his truck. Drury, who along with Tredeaux, called 9-1-1, followed the suspect until he abandoned his vehicle on Duss Street, a dead-end road, the report states. \n \n In his 9-1-1 call, Drury told the dispatcher, “You’re gonna love this — I’m following the suspect.” \n \n Blackwell Jr. ended up on Tredeaux’s driveway at the 700 block of Edward Street. Tredeaux said the teen yelled, “He shot me! He shot me! My dad shot me! Call 9-1-1!” as he ran down Edward. Tredeaux, who said he teaches shooting sports at the Boy Scouts camp in Paisley, said he grabbed a chair for the teenager and tried to calm him down as he called 9-1-1. \n \n “He was shot all over the body,” Tredeaux told the sheriff’s dispatcher. “He says he can’t breathe.” \n \n In the 9-1-1 recording, Tredeaux could be heard repeatedly telling the moaning teenager to “stay calm” and “stay with me.” \n \n Drury’s wife, Tami, told police that she also saw the victim running and holding his side. Tredeaux said he was able to help Blackwell Jr. and keep him calm because, “I took emergency preparedness with the Boy Scouts and various police departments in the area.” He said police told him not to discuss the shooting or the case. \n \n Griffith said Blackwell Sr. shot his son in the abdomen, the leg, the hip and the arm. \n \n Investigators were present when the teen was in surgery and were told by the doctor that one bullet had struck several organs and another bullet was lodged in his hip and was too dangerous to remove. The doctor said Blackwell Jr. was also shot in the right arm, and that was a “through and through shot,” the report states. \n \n Blackwell Sr. tried to surrender at the Volusia County Branch Jail later Sunday night, but was taken back to New Smyrna Beach police headquarters. Investigators attempted to interview him just after midnight Monday, but he refused to talk and said he wanted an attorney, the report states. Blackwell Sr. was denied bail by a judge at his first appearance hearing at the jail on Monday afternoon. \n \n The younger Blackwell helped the New Smyrna Beach High School weightlifting team win a state title in April in Class 2A by finishing second in the 183-pound division.', 'Man shot son on Father\'s Day, New Smyrna Beach police say Eugene Blackwell Sr. held on no bond at Volusia Jail \n \n EVAN LAMBERT IN ORANGE COUNTY.

For this is an army on the advance, and the city they are entering was until 48 hours ago their enemies’ most important redoubt. \n \n Ukrainian forces established a ring of checkpoints around Slavyansk in early May, effectively laying siege to the city in an attempt to contain the rebel expansion. \n \n But the blockade was fractured and the isolated checkpoints vulnerable to attacks by rebel forces based in the city. \n \n A little over a week earlier, rebels used tanks to surprise and destroy a checkpoint to the north of the city, in a demoralising blow to government forces. \n \n It was one strike in a scrappy war of raid and counter-raid at which the highly motivated pro-Russian fighters excelled – and which appeared to be locked in a bloody stalemate. \n \n Ukrainian soldiers look at wrecked tanks and armored personnel carriers left by pro-Russian insurgents in Slavyansk, Ukraine (Getty) \n \n That resistance crumbled suddenly and in the early hours of Saturday morning, following several days of artillery bombardment to which the rebels had no answer. \n \n Gathering their remaining tanks and fighting vehicles, Igor Strelkov, the rebel commander, and his men made a desperate dash for Donetsk, the regional capital 60 miles to the south where the self-declared People’s Republic had established its government. \n \n Most – but not all – of the fighters appear to have got through. With the rebel army regrouping, fears are growing of a similar, and perhaps even bloodier, siege in Donetsk, which, with a population of one million, is 10 times the size of Slavyansk. \n \n Two days after the break-out, Slavyansk – scarred by battle, but far from destroyed – is still a long way from a return to pre-war normality. Ukrainian troops are building their own pillboxes to reinforce checkpoints and sandbag bunkers once manned by pro-Russian militiamen. \n \n There is still no running water or electricity. Gas has cut out more than once and few, if any, businesses are open. The streets remain largely deserted, much of the civilian population having fled or remaining indoors. \n \n On Lenin Square, a small crowd of mostly elderly civilians waited for distribution of the “humanitarian” supplies – mostly food, water and medicines – promised by Kiev. Lenin’s statue now supports a shield emblazoned with the stylised trident of the Ukrainian coat of arms. \n \n The exact extent of the damage is still difficult to assess. Access to the city and surrounding area is strictly controlled by the Ukrainians. \n \n “We’ve got nothing. Nothing. I never expected to feel such fear,” said Elena, 51, as she watched Ukrainian troops trying to salvage a tank – it was not clear whose – that had rolled down a nearby gully. “We’ve only survived because we keep a bit of a reserve of water and food.” \n \n Mines lay near a destroyed pro-Russian APC near the city of Slovyansk (AP) \n \n Like many, she declined to voice a preference for one side or the other, only giving thanks that the fear and danger of the past three months appears to be at an end. \n \n A mile further on, just past the roadside monolith welcoming drivers to Slavyansk, the blackened turret of another tank obstructed the northbound lane. The rest of the vehicle had been thrown off the embankment on the other side of the road. Between them was the crater of the explosion that destroyed it. \n \n Nearby, the tangled remains of an armoured personnel carrier sat among Ukrainian anti-tank mines, destroyed vehicle parts, and its own unused ammunition, apparently scattered but not detonated by the explosion that destroyed it. \n \n Major Andrei Tokatsyuk, the Ukrainian paratrooper who has commanded a checkpoint here since early May, said this was all that remained of a rebel armoured column that had tried to break through his checkpoint in the early hours of Saturday. \n \n He claimed to have lost one man, compared with almost the entire rebel force, though he declined to put a number on the enemy dead. One burnt body remained unburied on the hard shoulder. \n \n This appears to be a victory won partly by superior fire power – it is the vast artillery barrage unleashed by the Ukrainians following the end of a ceasefire last week that appears to have finally forced the rebels into retreat. \n \n But it is also a matter of attrition and numbers. Where the “anti-terrorist operation” was once an undermanned, under-equipped shambles, the area is now swarming with thousands of servicemen in a motley mix of uniforms – special forces, regular army, police and the National Guard, which is largely drawn from the revolutionary militias that overthrew Viktor Yanukovych in February. In a strange twist, they now serve alongside men of the Berkut, the elite riot police with whom they fought running battles in Kiev this winter. Even the freelance pro-Kiev militias such as the Donbass battalion, raised and equipped by private individuals and with a previously fractious relationship with the army, appear to have been brought into the fold. \n \n An elderly woman walks away from a damaged house in Slavyansk, Ukraine (Photoshot) \n \n The columns of advancing troops moving south into the newly captured territory over the past two days may be led by armoured vehicles, but many troops travel in buses, police cars, and Nissan pick-up trucks sprayed green and mounted with machineguns. \n \n Neither side in this war is rich and both armies depend on imaginative battlefield improvisation. But the superior numbers and resources of the Ukrainians are beginning to tell. \n \n Out-gunned, outnumbered, and with the Kremlin refusing to respond to their pleas for military intervention, the fighters of the Donetsk People’s Republic appear to be facing certain defeat. \n \n Yet this war is still far from over. \n \n The rebel militia may have suffered a major setback, but their dogged defence of Slavyansk and the breakout itself shows a fighting ability and level of motivation that will make any battle for Donetsk a bloody affair. \n \n On Monday, Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Ahmetov, pleaded with the government not to bomb his home city. Pro-Russian rebels put up new barricades and residents said they feared the potential battle to come. Thousands have already left Donetsk, but most have nowhere to go, local officials said. \n \n Meanwhile the rebels are preparing for the expected government assault, destroying a railway bridge to block the highway north of the city and blowing up bridges on two other roads. \n \n They have even commandeered a vintage Soviet tank from the city’s Second World War museum. “We have got an engine to go in it,” said one rebel. “We have got some experts. We have to add the engine, ease the turret and it will be a working battle tank.”']",2,"– ""We are not thugs.

Of that, plants make up 450 gigatons of carbon (GT C), followed by bacteria at 70 GT C and fungi at 12 GT C, scientists report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Animals comprise a mere 2 GT C, of which half are arthropods—including insects, spiders, and crustaceans. And although humans weigh in at just 0.06 GT C—on par with krill and termites—our impact on biomass since the beginning of civilization has been huge, scientists say. Humans and their cattle, pigs, and other livestock outweigh wild mammals by more than 20-fold; similarly, domesticated fowl surpass all other birds. Humans have also had an impact on plant biomass, which has been cut in half in the past 10,000 years. \n \n To figure out the biomass of each creature, quantitative biologists spent 3 years combing the scientific literature. But their ultimate goal wasn’t to figure out how much life weighs—it was to discover the most abundant protein on the planet. They’re still working on that question (subsurface microbes presented them with a particular challenge), but they hope to answer it within the coming year.', 'In this April 11, 2018, file photo, two boys push their scooters through a park with green blossoming trees in Frankfurt, Germany.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst, File) When you weigh all life on Earth, billions of humans don\'t amount to much compared to trees, earthworms or even viruses. But we really know how to throw what little weight we have around, according to a first-of-its-kind global census of the footprint of life on the planet. \n \n Humans only add up to about one ten-thousandth of the life on Earth, measured by the dry weight of the carbon that makes up the structure of all living things, also known as biomass. \n \n The planet\'s real heavyweights are plants. They outweigh people by about 7,500 to 1, and make up more than 80 percent of the world\'s biomass, a study in Monday\'s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. \n \n Bacteria are nearly 13 percent of the world\'s biomass. Fungi—yeast, mold and mushrooms—make up about 2 percent. These estimates aren\'t very exact, the real numbers could be more or less, but they give a sense of proportion, said study lead author Ron Milo, a biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. \n \n ""The fact that the biomass of fungi exceeds that of all animals sort of puts us in our place,"" said Harvard evolutionary biology professor James Hanken, who wasn\'t part of the study. \n \n Still, humans have an outsized influence on its more massive fellow creatures.

Taking water out of the equation and measuring only dry carbon makes it easier for scientists to compare species. About one-sixth the weight of a human is dry carbon. Humans are about two-thirds water. \n \n ""Even though short in numbers, we have managed to throw a lot of sand in the air and mess up a lot of things,"" said noted Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson, who wasn\'t involved in the study. \n \n Explore further: Humans may influence cancer in many other species on the planet \n \n More information: Yinon M.

Yet since the dawn of civilisation, humanity has caused the loss of 83% of all wild mammals and half of plants, while livestock kept by humans abounds. \n \n The new work is the first comprehensive estimate of the weight of every class of living creature and overturns some long-held assumptions. Bacteria are indeed a major life form – 13% of everything – but plants overshadow everything, representing 82% of all living matter. All other creatures, from insects to fungi, to fish and animals, make up just 5% of the world’s biomass. \n \n Another surprise is that the teeming life revealed in the oceans by the recent BBC television series Blue Planet II turns out to represent just 1% of all biomass. The vast majority of life is land-based and a large chunk – an eighth – is bacteria buried deep below the surface. \n \n “I was shocked to find there wasn’t already a comprehensive, holistic estimate of all the different components of biomass,” said Prof Ron Milo, at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, who led the work, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n “I would hope this gives people a perspective on the very dominant role that humanity now plays on Earth,” he said, adding that he now chooses to eat less meat due to the huge environmental impact of livestock. \n \n The transformation of the planet by human activity has led scientists to the brink of declaring a new geological era – the Anthropocene. One suggested marker for this change are the bones of the domestic chicken, now ubiquitous across the globe. \n \n The new work reveals that farmed poultry today makes up 70% of all birds on the planet, with just 30% being wild. The picture is even more stark for mammals – 60% of all mammals on Earth are livestock, mostly cattle and pigs, 36% are human and just 4% are wild animals. \n \n “It is pretty staggering,” said Milo. “In wildlife films, we see flocks of birds, of every kind, in vast amounts, and then when we did the analysis we found there are [far] more domesticated birds.” \n \n The destruction of wild habitat for farming, logging and development has resulted in the start of what many scientists consider the sixth mass extinction of life to occur in the Earth’s four billion year history. About half the Earth’s animals are thought to have been lost in the last 50 years. \n \n \n \n But comparison of the new estimates with those for the time before humans became farmers and the industrial revolution began reveal the full extent of the huge decline. Just one-sixth of wild mammals, from mice to elephants, remain, surprising even the scientists. In the oceans, three centuries of whaling has left just a fifth of marine mammals in the oceans. \n \n “It is definitely striking, our disproportionate place on Earth,” said Milo. “When I do a puzzle with my daughters, there is usually an elephant next to a giraffe next to a rhino. But if I was trying to give them a more realistic sense of the world, it would be a cow next to a cow next to a cow and then a chicken.” \n \n Despite humanity’s supremacy, in weight terms Homo sapiens is puny. Viruses alone have a combined weight three times that of humans, as do worms. Fish are 12 times greater than people and fungi 200 times as large. \n \n But our impact on the natural world remains immense, said Milo, particularly in what we choose to eat: “Our dietary choices have a vast effect on the habitats of animals, plants and other organisms.” \n \n “I would hope people would take this [work] as part of their world view of how they consume,” he said. ”I have not become vegetarian, but I do take the environmental impact into my decision making, so it helps me think, do I want to choose beef or poultry or use tofu instead?” \n \n The researchers calculated the biomass estimates using data from hundreds of studies, which often used modern techniques, such as satellite remote sensing that can scan great areas, and gene sequencing that can unravel the myriad organisms in the microscopic world. \n \n They started by assessing the biomass of a class of organisms and then they determined which environments such life could live in across the world to create a global total. They used carbon as the key measure and found all life contains 550bn tonnes of the element. The researchers acknowledge that substantial uncertainties remain in particular estimates, especially for bacteria deep underground, but say the work presents a useful overview. \n \n Paul Falkowski, at Rutgers University in the US and not part of the research team, said: “The study is, to my knowledge, the first comprehensive analysis of the biomass distribution of all organisms – including viruses – on Earth.” \n \n “There are two major takeaways from this paper,” he said. “First, humans are extremely efficient in exploiting natural resources. Humans have culled, and in some cases eradicated, wild mammals for food or pleasure in virtually all continents. Second, the biomass of terrestrial plants overwhelmingly dominates on a global scale – and most of that biomass is in the form of wood.”', 'Significance The composition of the biosphere is a fundamental question in biology, yet a global quantitative account of the biomass of each taxon is still lacking. We assemble a census of the biomass of all kingdoms of life. This analysis provides a holistic view of the composition of the biosphere and allows us to observe broad patterns over taxonomic categories, geographic locations, and trophic modes. \n \n Abstract A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. \n \n One of the most fundamental efforts in biology is to describe the composition of the living world. Centuries of research have yielded an increasingly detailed picture of the species that inhabit our planet and their respective roles in global ecosystems. In describing a complex system like the biosphere, it is critical to quantify the abundance of individual components of the system (i.e., species, broader taxonomic groups). A quantitative description of the distribution of biomass is essential for taking stock of biosequestered carbon (1) and modeling global biogeochemical cycles (2), as well as for understanding the historical effects and future impacts of human activities. \n \n Earlier efforts to estimate global biomass have mostly focused on plants (3⇓–5). In parallel, a dominant role for prokaryotic biomass has been advocated in a landmark paper by Whitman et al. (6) entitled “Prokaryotes: The unseen majority.” New sampling and detection techniques (7, 8) make it possible to revisit this claim. Likewise, for other taxa, such as fish, recent global sampling campaigns (9) have resulted in updated estimates, often differing by an order of magnitude or more from previous estimates. For groups such as arthropods, global estimates are still lacking (10, 11). \n \n All of the above efforts are each focused on a single taxon. We are aware of only two attempts at a comprehensive accounting of all biomass components on Earth: Whittaker and Likens (12) made a remarkable effort in the early 1970s, noting even then that their study was “intended for early obsolescence.” It did not include, for example, bacterial or fungal biomass. The other attempt, by Smil (13), was included as a subsection of a book intended for a broad readership. His work details characteristic values for the biomass of various taxa in many environments. Finally, Wikipedia serves as a highly effective platform for making accessible a range of estimates on various taxa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)#Global_biomass) but currently falls short of a comprehensive or integrated view. \n \n In the past decade, several major technological and scientific advances have facilitated an improved quantitative account of the biomass on Earth. Next-generation sequencing has enabled a more detailed and cultivation-independent view of the composition of natural communities based on the relative abundance of genomes (14). Better remote sensing tools enable us to probe the environment on a global scale with unprecedented resolution and specificity. The Tara Oceans expedition (15) is among recent efforts at global sampling that are expanding our view and coverage. Continental counterpart efforts, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network in North America, add more finely resolved, continent-specific details, affording us more robust descriptions of natural habitats. \n \n Here, we either assemble or generate estimates of the biomass for each of the major taxonomic groups that contribute to the global biomass distribution. Our analysis (described in detail in SI Appendix) is based on hundreds of studies, including recent studies that have overturned earlier estimates for many taxa (e.g., fish, subsurface prokaryotes, marine eukaryotes, soil fauna). \n \n Discussion Our census of the distribution of biomass on Earth provides an integrated global picture of the relative and absolute abundances of all kingdoms of life. We find that the biomass of plants dominates the biomass of the biosphere and is mostly located on land. The marine environment is primarily occupied by microbes, mainly bacteria and protists, which account for ≈70% of the total marine biomass. The remaining ≈30% is mainly composed of arthropods and fish. The deep subsurface holds ≈15% of the total biomass in the biosphere. It is chiefly composed of bacteria and archaea, which are mostly surface-attached and turn over their biomass every several months to thousands of years (18⇓⇓⇓–22). In addition to summarizing current knowledge of the global biomass distribution, our work highlights gaps in the current understanding of the biosphere. Our knowledge of the biomass composition of different taxa is mainly determined by our ability to sample their biomass in the wild. For groups such as plants, the use of multiple sources to estimate global biomass increases our confidence in the validity of current estimates. However, for other groups, such as terrestrial arthropods and protists, quantitative sampling of biomass is limited by technical constraints, and comprehensive data are thus lacking. Beyond specific taxa, there are entire environments for which our knowledge is very limited, namely, the deep subsurface environments such as deep aquifers and the ocean’s crust, which might hold the world largest aquifer (38). Studies in these environments are scarce, meaning that our estimates have particularly high uncertainty ranges and unknown systematic biases. Main gaps in our knowledge of these environments pertain to the distribution of biomass between the aquifer fluids and the surrounding rocks and the distribution of biomass between different microbial taxa, such as bacteria, archaea, protists, and fungi. Scientists have closely monitored the impact of humans on global biodiversity (39⇓–41), but less attention has been given to total biomass, resulting in high uncertainty regarding the impact of humanity on the biomass of vertebrates. Our estimates for the current and prehuman biomasses of vertebrates are only a crude first step in calculating these values (SI Appendix, Prehuman Biomass). The biomass of amphibians, which are experiencing a dramatic population decline (42), remains poorly characterized. Future research could reduce the uncertainty of current estimates by sampling more environments, which will better represent the diverse biosphere on Earth. In the case of prokaryotes, some major improvements were recently realized, with global estimates of marine deep subsurface prokaryote biomass reduced by about two orders of magnitude due to an increased diversity of sampling locations (7). Identifying gaps in our knowledge could indicate areas for which further scientific exploration could have the biggest impact on our understanding of the biosphere. As a concrete example, we identify the ratio between attached to unattached cells in the deep aquifers as a major contributor to the uncertainties associated with our estimate of the biomass of bacteria, archaea, and viruses. Improving our understanding of this specific parameter could help us better constrain the global biomasses of entire domains of life. In addition to improving our reported estimates, future studies can achieve a finer categorization of taxa. For example, the biomass of parasites, which is not resolved from their hosts in this study, might be larger than the biomass of top predators in some environments (43). By providing a unified, updated, and accessible global view of the biomass of different taxa, we also aim to disseminate knowledge of the biosphere composition to a wide range of students and researchers. Our survey puts into perspective claims regarding the overarching dominance of groups such as termites and ants (44), nematodes (45), and prokaryotes (6). For example, the biomass of termites [≈0.05 Gt C (25)] is on par with that of humans but is still around an order of magnitude smaller than that of other taxa, such as fish (≈0.7 Gt C; SI Appendix, Table S15). Other groups, such as nematodes, surpass any other animal species in terms of number of individuals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2) but constitute only about 1% of the total animal biomass. The census of biomass distribution on Earth presented here is comprehensive in scope and based on synthesis of data from the recent scientific literature. The integrated dataset enables us to draw basic conclusions concerning kingdoms that dominate the biomass of the biosphere, the distribution of biomass of each kingdom across different environments, and the opposite structures of the global marine and terrestrial biomass pyramids. We identify areas in which current knowledge is lacking and further research is most required. Ideally, future research will include both temporal and geographic resolution. We believe that the results described in this study will provide students and researchers with a holistic quantitative context for studying our biosphere. \n \n Materials and Methods Taxon-Specific Detailed Description of Data Sources and Procedures for Estimating Biomass. The complete account of the data sources used for estimating the biomass of each taxon, procedures for estimating biomass, and projections for the uncertainty associated with the estimate for the biomass of each taxon are provided in the SI Appendix. To make the steps for estimating the biomass of each taxon more accessible, we provide supplementary tables that summarize the procedure as well as online notebooks for the calculation of the biomass of each taxon (see data flow scheme in SI Appendix, Overview). In Table 1, we detail the relevant supplementary table that summarizes the steps for arriving at each estimate. All of the data used to generate our estimates, as well as the code used for analysis, are open-sourced and available at https://github.com/milo-lab/biomass_distribution. Choice of Units for Measuring Biomass. Biomass is reported in gigatons of carbon. Alternative options to represent biomass include, among others, biovolume, wet mass, or dry weight. We chose to use carbon mass as the measure of biomass because it is independent of water content and is used extensively in the literature. Dry mass also has these features but is used less frequently. All of our reported values can be transformed to dry weight to a good approximation by multiplying by 2, the characteristic conversion factor between carbon and total dry mass (46⇓–48). We report the significant digits for our values throughout the paper using the following scheme: For values with an uncertainty projection that is higher than twofold, we report a single significant digit. For values with an uncertainty projection of less than twofold, we report two significant digits. In cases when we report one significant digit, we do not consider a leading “1” as a significant digit. General Framework for Estimating Global Biomass. In achieving global estimates, there is a constant challenge of how to move from a limited set of local samples to a representative global value. How does one estimate global biomass based on a limited set of local samples? For a crude estimate, the average of all local values of biomass per unit area is multiplied by the total global area. A more effective estimate can be made by correlating measured values to environmental parameters that are known at a global scale (e.g., temperature, depth, distance from shore, primary productivity, biome type), as shown in Fig. 3. This correlation is used to extrapolate the biomass of a taxon at a specific location based on the known distribution of the environmental parameter (e.g., the temperature at each location on the globe). By integrating across the total surface of the world, a global estimate is derived. We detail the specific extrapolation procedure used for each taxon in both the SI Appendix and supplementary tables (SI Appendix, Tables S1–S23). For most taxa, our best estimates are based on a geometric mean of several independent estimates using different methodologies. The geometric mean estimates the median value if the independent estimates are log-normally distributed or, more generally, the distribution of estimates is symmetrical in log space. Fig. 3. General framework for estimating global biomass. The procedure begins with local samples of biomass across the globe. The more representative the samples are of the natural distribution of the taxon biomass, the more accurate the estimate will be. To move from local samples to a global estimate, a correlation between local biomass densities and an environmental parameter (or parameters) is established. Based on this correlation, in addition to our knowledge of the distribution of the environmental parameter, we extrapolate the biomass across the entire globe. The resolution of the resulting biomass distribution map is dependent on the resolution at which we know the environmental parameter. Integrating across the entire surface of the Earth, we get a global estimate of the biomass of the taxon. Uncertainty Estimation and Reporting. Global estimates such as those we use in the present work are largely based on sampling from the distribution of biomass worldwide and then extrapolating for areas in which samples are missing. The sampling of biomass in each location can be based on direct biomass measurements or conversion to biomass from other types of measurement, such as number of individuals and their characteristic weight. Some of the main sources of uncertainty for the estimates we present are the result of using such geographical extrapolations and conversion from number of individuals to overall biomass. The certainty of the estimate is linked to the amount of sampling on which the estimate is based. Notable locations in which sampling is scarce are the deep ocean (usually deeper than 200 m) and deep layers of soil (usually deeper than 1 m). For some organisms, such as annelids and marine protists and arthropods, most estimates neglect these environments, thus underestimating the actual biomass. Sampling can be biased toward places that have high abundance and diversity of wildlife. Relying on data with such sampling bias can cause overestimation of the actual biomass of a taxon. Another source of uncertainty comes from conversion to biomass. Conversion from counts of individuals to biomass is based on either known average weights per individual (e.g., 50 kg of wet weight for a human, which averages over adults and children, or 10 mg of dry weight for a “characteristic” earthworm) or empirical allometric equations that are organism-specific, such as conversion from animal length to biomass. When using such conversion methods, there is a risk of introducing biases and noise into the final estimate. Nevertheless, there is often no way around using such conversions. As such, we must be aware that the data may contain such biases. In addition to describing the procedures leading to the estimate of each taxon, we quantitatively survey the main sources of uncertainty associated with each estimate and calculate an uncertainty range for each of our biomass estimates. We choose to report uncertainties as representing, to the best of our ability given the many constraints, what is equivalent to a 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the mean. Uncertainties reported in our analysis are multiplicative (fold change from the mean) and not additive (± change of the estimate). We chose to use multiplicative uncertainty as it is more robust to large fluctuations in estimates, and because it is in accord with the way we generate our best estimates, which is usually by using a geometric mean of different independent estimates. Our uncertainty projections are focused on the main kingdoms of life: plants, bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, and animals. The general framework for constructing our uncertainties (described in detail for each taxon in the SI Appendix and in the online notebooks) takes into account both intrastudy uncertainty and interstudy uncertainty. Intrastudy uncertainty refers to uncertainty estimates reported within a specific study, whereas interstudy uncertainty refers to variation in estimates of a certain quantity between different papers. In many cases, we use several independent methodologies to estimate the same quantity. In these cases, we can also use the variation between estimates from each methodology as a measure of the uncertainty of our final estimate. We refer to this type of uncertainty as intermethod uncertainty. The way we usually calculate uncertainties is by taking the logarithm of the values reported either within studies or from different studies. Taking the logarithm moves the values to log-space, where the SE is calculated (by dividing the SD by the square root of the number of values). We then multiply the SE by a factor of 1.96 (which would give the 95% confidence interval if the transformed data were normally distributed). Finally, we exponentiate the result to get the multiplicative factor in linear space that represents the confidence interval (akin to a 95% confidence interval if the data were log-normally distributed). Most of our estimates are constructed by combining several different estimates (e.g., combining total number of individuals and characteristic carbon content of a single organism). In these cases, we use intrastudy, interstudy, or intermethod variation associated with each parameter that is used to derive the final estimate and propagate these uncertainties to the final estimate of biomass. The uncertainty analysis for each specific biomass estimate incorporates different components of this general scheme, depending on the amount of information that is available, as detailed on a case-by-case basis in the SI Appendix. In cases where information is ample, the procedure described above yields several different uncertainty estimates for each parameter that we use to derive the final estimate (e.g., intrastudy uncertainty, interstudy uncertainty). We integrate these different uncertainties, usually by taking the highest value as the best projection of uncertainty. In some cases, for example, when information is scarce or some sources of uncertainty are hard to quantify, we base our estimates on the uncertainty in analogous taxa and consultation with relevant experts. We tend to round up our uncertainty projections when data are especially limited. Taxonomic Levels Used. Our census gives estimates for the global biomass at various taxonomic levels. Our main results relate to the kingdom level: animals, archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and protists. Although the division into kingdoms is not the most contemporary taxonomic grouping that exists, we chose to use it for the current analysis as most of the data we rely upon does not provide finer taxonomic details (e.g., the division of terrestrial protists is mainly based on morphology and not on taxonomy). We supplement these kingdoms of living organisms with an estimate for the global biomass of viruses, which are not included in the current tree of life but play a key role in global biogeochemical cycles (49). For all kingdoms except animals, all taxa making up the kingdom are considered together. For estimating the biomass of animals, we use a bottom-up approach, which estimates the biomass of key phyla constituting the animal kingdom. The sum of the biomass of these phyla represents our estimate of the total biomass of animals. We give estimates for most phyla and estimate bounds for the possible biomass contribution for the remaining phyla (SI Appendix, Other Animal Phyla). Within chordates, we provide estimates for key classes, such as fish, mammals, and birds. We estimate that the contribution of reptiles and amphibians to the total chordate biomass is negligible, as we discuss in the SI Appendix. We divide the class of mammals into wild mammals and humans plus livestock (without a contribution from poultry, which is negligible compared with cattle and pigs). Even though livestock is not a valid taxonomic division, we use it to consider the impact of humans on the total biomass of mammals. \n \n Acknowledgments We thank Shai Meiri for help with estimating the biomass of wild mammals, birds, and reptiles and Arren Bar-Even, Oded Beja, Jorg Bernhardt, Tristan Biard, Chris Bowler, Nuno Carvalhais, Otto Coredero, Gidon Eshel, Ofer Feinerman, Noah Fierer, Daniel Fisher, Avi Flamholtz, Assaf Gal, José Grünzweig, Marcel van der Heijden, Dina Hochhauser, Julie Huber, Qusheng Jin, Bo Barker Jørgensen, Jens Kallmeyer, Tamir Klein, Christian Koerner, Daniel Madar, Fabrice Not, Katherine O’Donnell, Gal Ofir, Victoria Orphan, Noam Prywes, John Raven, Dave Savage, Einat Segev, Maya Shamir, Izak Smit, Rotem Sorek, Ofer Steinitz, Miri Tsalyuk, Assaf Vardi, Colomban de Vargas, Joshua Weitz, Yossi Yovel, Yonatan Zegman, and two anonymous reviewers for productive feedback on this manuscript.

As in 0.01%, reports the Guardian. The flip side of that? Despite the scant figure, humans have reshaped the animal kingdom, helping wipe out about 83% of mammals and half of all plants since civilization began, according to the comprehensive survey in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For this study, researchers weren't counting individual members of species. This is all about weight—they surveyed the Earth's biomass, meaning the carbon content in living creatures. Start with this: All life on the planet weighs about 550 gigatons, notes Science. The new study breaks down that figure, including these highlights: Plants account for an astounding 82% of the planet's biomass Bacteria make up 13%—leaving just 5% for everything else beyond plants and bacteria Fungi (think yeast, mold, and mushrooms) make up 2% Ocean life makes up a surprisingly small 1% Chicken and other poultry make up 70% of all birds on the planet; only 30% are wild Livestock (mostly cows and pigs) make up 60% of all mammals; humans account for 36% of mammals, leaving only 4% as wild ""The fact that the biomass of fungi exceeds that of all animals sort of puts us in our place,"" says Harvard biology professor James Hanken, who wasn't part of the study, per a release at Phys.org."
227,"['A prominent Iranian lawmaker said Tehran doesn\'t need any more 20 percent-enriched uranium, a news agency covering the country\'s parliament reported late Wednesday night, a key point in negotiations between the Islamic Republic and the West. \n \n In this picture taken on Friday, Nov. 2, 2012, Iranian school girls show their hands with writing in Persian in support supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, denouncing the U.S. and one of them with... (Associated Press) \n \n While lawmaker Hossein Naqvi Hosseini isn\'t a government spokesman nor a member of Iran\'s nuclear negotiation team, his comments touch on a major concession wanted by Western powers _ halting production of enriched uranium that could be used to build nuclear weapons. \n \n Hosseini\'s brief comments, published online by ICANA, did not say whether Iran will stop enrichment. \n \n ""Tehran reactor fuel has been supplied and currently no need is felt for production of 20 percent-enriched uranium,"" Hosseini was quoted as saying. \n \n Hosseini, who serves as a spokesman for the Iranian parliament\'s national security and foreign policy committee, also said the country is prepared to relieve concerns over its stockpile of enriched uranium. \n \n ""Tehran is ready to convert its stockpile of 20 percent-enriched uranium to fuel rods and remove concerns over its non-peaceful use,"" he was quoted as saying. He offered no other details about what steps Iran would take. \n \n Western powers fear Iran\'s nuclear program could be used to build an atomic bomb. Iran says its program is peaceful and is for advances in medical research and power generation. \n \n Last week, Iranian diplomats met in Geneva with negotiators from the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. Iran hopes to ease the crippling economic and oil sanctions placed on its government over its contested nuclear program. \n \n Iran currently runs more than 10,000 centrifuges which have created tons of fuel-grade material that can be further enriched to arm nuclear warheads. Tehran also has nearly 440 pounds (200 kilograms) of higher-enriched uranium in a form that can be turned into weapons much more quickly. Experts say 550 pounds (250 kilograms) of 20 percent-enriched uranium are needed to produce a single warhead \n \n Among key concessions wanted by the West, according to two diplomats who spoke with The Associated Press, is that Iran stop enriching uranium to 20 percent. The diplomats say Iran offered to halt 20 percent enrichment at last week\'s Geneva talks. However, the Iranian government hasn\'t publicly commented on that. \n \n Negotiators from Iran and the six powers are due to meet in Geneva for further talks on Nov. 7-8.', 'Iran\'s announcement that it has halted enriching uranium to a level close to bomb-grade appears to signal rare progress in nuclear talks. But there is much working against a deal. \n \n In this 2010 file photo, a worker rides a bicycle in front of the reactor building of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, just outside the southern city of Bushehr, Iran. \n \n By most accounts, the negotiations in Geneva over Iran’s nuclear program are going well. \n \n Diplomats have been tight-lipped, but signals sent by Iran and by diplomats from the US and other world powers indicate the sides are finding common ground in the dispute over Iran\'s nuclear intentions. Tehran insists its program is for research and electricity generation, but the US and others, particularly Israel, are skeptical. \n \n For optimists, a claim Thursday that Iran has halted enrichment of uranium to the critical 20-percent threshold is a sign that 24 years of bile and bluster between Tehran and Washington may be at an end. \n \n A halt to 20 percent enrichment is among the key concessions wanted by the West, and according to The Associated Press, Iran made that offer at last week\'s talks. (Twenty percent is important because the most challenging part of uranium enrichment happens below that threshold; once you get to 20 percent, it’s relatively easy to enrich up to bomb-grade levels). \n \n Unnamed US officials say talks are going well. \n \n “I have never had such intense, detailed, straightforward, candid conversations with the Iranian delegation before,” said one US negotiator who gave reporters an off-the-record briefing last week. \n \n The loudest voice in the pessimists\' camp is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who wants to force the Iranians to give up their fissile material altogether. He insists Iran open up its underground facilities and says the only reason someone would burrow scientific facilities into mountainsides is to protect them from air strikes, a point he reiterated in meetings with US Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday. \n \n ""They should get rid of the amassed fissile material, and they shouldn\'t have underground nuclear facilities,"" Netanyahu was quoted as saying. Mr. Kerry has insisted the US is proceeding with “eyes wide open” when it comes to negotiating with the Iranians, and that “no deal is better than a bad deal.” \n \n There are plenty of trends pointing toward a breakthrough. Economic sanctions appear to be having a serious impact on the Iranian economy (though they may not be as debilitating as some have suggested.) The West succeeded in getting Iran’s closest ally, Syria, to give up its chemical weapons, for instance. \n \n But there are also obstacles. Iran’s recently elected president, Hassan Rouhani, is considered a centrist among Iranian officials and faces growing criticism from hardliners that Mr. Rouhani and the US-educated foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, are conceding too much to the US. \n \n Though Rouhani was elected, Iran’s political system means that the person who has ultimate authority is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been sending mixed signals about the talks. The comment that gave the optimists most hope was Mr. Khamenei call a few weeks back for “heroic flexibility.” But the commentary from conservative publications in Tehran suggests behind-the-scenes debate. \n \n In the US, meanwhile, some hawkish members of Congress say they’ve been at least partially reassured by briefings from the White House on the negotiations. That, however, hasn’t stopped those who believe Iran isn’t to be trusted in any way shape or form, most notably Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino owner, influential Israel supporter and funder of US conservative politicians, who on Tuesday called for the US to launch a nuclear strike on the Iranian desert. \n \n Current betting favors some sort of agreement on Iran’s nuclear program. But at this point whether the agreement will have lasting power is anyone’s guess. \n \n The next round of Geneva talks resume on Nov. 7.', 'Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a nuclear bomb in as little as a month, according to a new estimate by one of the USA\'s top nuclear experts. \n \n Iran\'s President Hassan Rouhani, second left, gives a speech during an annual military parade in Tehran, Iran, Sept, 22, 2013. (Photo: Ebrahim Noroozi, AP) Story Highlights The Obama administration has said Iran is probably a year away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb \n \n Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country has no interest in nuclear weapons \n \n U.N. inspectors have found evidence of a weapons program \n \n Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a nuclear bomb in as little as a month, according to a new estimate by one of the USA\'s top nuclear experts. \n \n The new assessment comes as the White House invited Senate staffers to a briefing on negotiations with Iran as it is trying to persuade Congress not to go ahead with a bill to stiffen sanctions against Iran. \n \n ""Shortening breakout times have implications for any negotiation with Iran,"" stated the report by the Institute for Science and International Security. ""An essential finding is that they are currently too short and shortening further."" \n \n David Albright, president of the institute and a former inspector for the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency, said the estimate means that Iran would have to eliminate more than half of its 19,000 centrifuges to extend the time it would take to build a bomb to six months. \n \n The Obama administration has said Iran is probably a year away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb. \n \n Bernadette Meehan, an NSC spokeswoman for President Obama\'s National Security Council, said the intelligence community maintains ""a number of assessments"" regarding potential time frames for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one weapon or a testable nuclear device.hi \n \n ""We continue to closely monitor the Iranian nuclear program and its stockpile of enriched uranium,"" Meehan said. \n \n World powers are seeking an agreement ""that ultimately resolves all of the international community\'s concerns about Iran\'s nuclear program,"" she said. ""The ultimate goal is a comprehensive agreement that is credible, transparent, and verifiable."" \n \n In the report, Albright said negotiations with Iran should focus on so-called ""breakout"" times, or the time required to convert low-enriched uranium to weapons-grade. \n \n Albright, who has testified before Congress, said the negotiators should try to find ways to lengthen the breakout times and shorten the time that inspectors could detect breakout. ISIS\' analysis is based on the latest Iranian and United Nations reports on Iran\'s centrifuge equipment for producing nuclear fuel and its nuclear fuel stockpiles. \n \n Iran\'s stockpile of medium-enriched uranium has nearly doubled in a year\'s time and its number of centrifuges has expanded from 12,000 in 2012 to 19,000 today. \n \n Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican whose Senate Banking Committee is considering legislation to tighten Iran sanctions, said the report shows that Iran is expanding its nuclear capabilities under the cover of negotiations. \n \n ""The Senate should move forward immediately with a new round of sanctions to prevent Iran from acquiring an undetectable breakout capability,"" he said. \n \n The White House has said new sanctions legislation should wait while current negotiations — scheduled to resume officially in Geneva next month — are moving forward. \n \n The White House said Thursday it will continue consulting with Congress ""so that any congressional action is aligned with our negotiating strategy as we move forward,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for President Obama\'s National Security Council. \n \n Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country has no interest in nuclear weapons but that producing nuclear fuel is Iran\'s right. His foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has said Iran will not ship its nuclear stockpile to a third country. \n \n However, Iran has blocked international inspectors from some suspected nuclear facilities to verify they are being used for peaceful purposes, access required under international agreements it has signed. \n \n United Nations inspectors have found evidence of a weapons program in violation of Iran\'s commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The USA and the U.N. Security Council have implemented crippling economic sanctions on Iran to sway it to take steps to assure the world it is not developing a bomb. \n \n Israel, which sees an Iranian nuclear bomb as a threat to its very existence, has said it will take military action to prevent Iran from getting a bomb. \n \n ISIS estimated in October 2012 that Iran could produce enough highly-enriched uranium for a bomb within two to four months. The new estimate is based on an analysis of the latest reports by Iran and the the IAEA. \n \n ISIS considered various scenarios, including if Iran decided to build a covert enrichment plant like it has under a mountain in Fordow, near the city of Qom, that was designed for optimal efficiency and minimal time to enrich enough uranium for bomb making. Such a facility built with current Iranian technology could produce enough material for a bomb in a week, according to the ISIS report. \n \n ""If they did that and they were caught it would be a smoking gun of a nuclear weapons program,"" Albright said. \n \n If Iran moves ahead with installation of its more efficient, second generation centrifuges, it would be able to produce enough nuclear fuel for a bomb with so few of them, between 2,000 and 3,300 centrifuges, that they could fit in a small warehouse, Albright said. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1gKaRJn', 'Image copyright AFP Image caption Schoolgirls staged a protest rally on 8 May after the first two rape and burning attacks \n \n A teenage girl in India has been raped and burned alive by her attacker - the third instance of such an attack in the same week. \n \n The 16-year-old girl died after being soaked in fuel and set on fire at her home in the Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. \n \n Police said she was killed after telling her attacker she would inform her family about the rape. \n \n Two other similar attacks, one fatal, took place in Jharkhand this week. \n \n A 17-year-old girl remains in critical condition after being set on fire by a suspect who allegedly said he wanted to marry the victim, but had been rejected. \n \n The earlier case involved a 16-year-old who was burned alive after her parents complained to village elders about her rape.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Associated Press) \n \n PITTSBURGH (AP) — During the week, anyone who wanted to get inside Pittsburgh\'s Tree of Life synagogue had to ring the doorbell and be granted entry by staff because the front door was kept locked. Not so on Saturday — the Jewish Sabbath — when the building was open for worship. \n \n A gunman who had expressed hatred of Jews exploited that vulnerability, so common in so many houses of worship across the country, in a singularly horrific way. \n \n Armed with a rifle and three handguns, Robert Bowers walked into the synagogue during Saturday morning worship and began shooting, killing 11 and wounding six before police took him into custody, officials said. It was the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history, according to the leader of the Anti-Defamation League. \n \n Bowers traded gunfire with police and was shot multiple times but survived. He was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts, including weapons offenses and hate crimes. Law enforcement officials planned to discuss the massacre at a news conference Sunday morning. \n \n Four police officers were among the wounded. \n \n The nation\'s latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. With the midterm election just over a week away, it also reignited a longstanding and bitter debate over guns. President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue ""had some kind of protection"" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania\'s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, up for re-election, noted that once again ""dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm\'s way."" \n \n Calling the shooting an ""evil anti-Semitic attack,"" Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in respect for the victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh, but offered no details. \n \n In the city, thousands gathered for a vigil Saturday night. Some blamed the slaughter on the nation\'s political climate. \n \n ""When you spew hate speech, people act on it. Very simple. And this is the result. A lot of people dead. Senselessly,"" said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. \n \n The shooting raised immediate alarm in Jewish communities around the country. Authorities in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and other cities sent extra patrols to synagogues and other houses of worship. \n \n Little was known about Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record but who is believed to have expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on social media. Authorities said it appears he acted alone. \n \n Worshippers ""were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith,"" said Bob Jones, head of the FBI\'s Pittsburgh office, though he cautioned the shooter\'s full motive was not yet known. \n \n Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, pledged that ""justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe."" \n \n It wasn\'t clear if Bowers had an attorney to speak on his behalf. \n \n The gunman targeted a building that housed three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Sabbath services when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh\'s Jewish community. \n \n The synagogue door was unlocked on the Sabbath ""because people are coming for services, and the bell would be ringing constantly. So they do not lock the door, and anybody can just walk in,"" said Marilyn Honigsberg, administrative assistant for New Light. ""And that\'s what this man did."" \n \n Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life, said synagogue officials had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But he said security was a concern, and the synagogue had started working to improve it. \n \n ""You know, you\'re always worried that something would happen,"" said Myron Snider, head of the cemetery committee for New Light. Snider just got out of the hospital on Thursday and missed Saturday\'s service. \n \n ""But you never dream that it would happen like this,"" Snider added. ""Just never ever dream that it would happen like this."" \n \n Zachary Weiss, 26, said his father, 60-year-old Stephen Weiss, was inside the synagogue but was unharmed. Weiss said his father told him that he and Tree of Life\'s rabbi helped congregants take shelter and follow the active shooter response training they\'d received months earlier. Stephen Weiss made it out of the building and used a janitor\'s cellphone to call his family at home. \n \n The attack, his son vowed, ""will not define our congregation and will not define our city."" \n \n ___ \n \n Breed reported from Raleigh, North Carolina, and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

CNN reports the previous attack to have that label occurred in 1985, when Seattle lawyer Charles Goldmark, his wife, and two sons were killed. (The Washington Post notes it ""was actually a case of mistaken religious identity,"" as the family was not Jewish.) The toll in Saturday's shooting stands at 11. The AP reports police on Sunday said the victims were eight men and three women. In an arrest affidavit made public, police say that while treating alleged shooter Robert Gregory Bowers for injuries he sustained after being shot by police, he said Jews were ""committing genocide to his people"" and that he wanted them all to die. The AP separately reports on a ""vulnerability"" the shooter took advantage of: an unlocked door. While the Tree of Life synagogue required guests to ring a bell to gain access during the week, on the Jewish Sabbath the building was open to all guests for Shabbat services. The Post quotes the FBI special agent in charge as saying it was ""the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen in 22 years."" Federal hate crime charges were filed against Bowers on Saturday: 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports Pittsburgh police also filed charges on Saturday: 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.

There is a second location with eyes on with all the right equipment to capture exactly what the shot was,"" another military source said. \n \n A military insider told The Globe: ""This is an incredible feat. It is a world record that might never be equalled."" \n \n The world record was previously held by British sniper Craig Harrison, who shot a Taliban gunner with a 338 Lapua Magnum rifle from 2,475 metres away in 2009. \n \n Previously, Canadian Corporal Rob Furlong had set the world record in 2002 at 2,430 metres when he gunned down an Afghan insurgent carrying an RPK machine gun during Operation Anaconda. \n \n Weeks before, Canadian Master Cpl. Arron Perry briefly held the world\'s best sniper record after he fatally shot an insurgent at 2,310 metres during the same operation. Both soldiers were members of the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia\'s Canadian Light Infantry. \n \n JTF2 special forces are primarily tasked with counterterrorism, sniper operations and hostage rescue. Much of the information about this elite organization is classified and not commented on by the government. The unit\'s snipers and members of Canadian Special Operations Regiment, who are carrying out the main task of training Kurdish forces, have been operating in tough conditions in Iraq. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n The Trudeau government pulled CF-18 fighter jets out of Iraq in 2016 but expanded the military mission, which will see the number of Canadian special forces trainers climb to 207 from 69 in an assist, train and advise mission. Canadian commandos are not supposed to be involved in direct combat, but are authorized to go up to the front lines on training missions with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and to paint targets for coalition air strikes. \n \n For operational security reasons, sources would not reveal the names of the elite Canadian sniper and his partner, nor the location where the action took place. \n \n A sniper and his observer partner are often sent to remote and dangerous locations to hunt down insurgents while having to carry heavy equipment. Once they have located the target, snipers follow the same methodical approach before each shot. Breathe in, out, in, out, find a natural pause and then squeeze the trigger. \n \n Canada has a reputation among Western military forces for the quality of its snipers, despite the small size of the Canadian Armed Forces compared to the United States and Britain. \n \n ""Canada has a world-class sniper system. It is not just a sniper. They work in pairs. There is an observer,"" a military source said.

And from that distance you actually have to account for the curvature of the Earth."" \n \n U.S. Sergeant Bryan Kremer has the longest confirmed sniper kill shot by a U.S. soldier. He killed an Iraqi insurgent with his Barrett M82A1 rifle at 2,300 metres in 2004.', 'The distances are mind-boggling: in 2002, Master Cpl. Arron Perry from the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry took aim at an Afghan insurgent from a distance of 2,300 metres and hit his target, setting the world record for the longest confirmed kill shot in military history. Not long after, Cpl. Rob Furlong, in the same operation, bested his brother-in-arms with a confirmed kill at 2,430 metres. His record would stand longer, until 2009, when a British sniper, Craig Harrison, made a shot from 2,475 metres. \n \n On June 21, Harrison’s record was shattered by another Canadian, an elite special forces sniper, who, according to the Canadian military, killed an ISIS fighter in Mosul from an incredible 3,540 metres. \n \n Let’s put that in perspective: if you stacked six CN Towers end to end, you would still be more than 200 metres short. The bullet, according to military experts, would have travelled for nearly 10 seconds before hitting its target. The shooter not only would have had to take into consideration wind conditions, but at that distance, also the curvature of the earth. \n \n More astonishing, perhaps, is the fact that over the last 15 years, the active-combat sniping record has been broken four times, and three of those have been by Canadians. \n \n That’s no coincidence, says Furlong, who now runs a marksmanship academy in Edmonton. \n \n “I’ve been saying this forever,” he tells Maclean’s by telephone. “Canadian snipers are the best in the world. The sniper training program has been around for a long time. It’s the foundation, and it’s been retooled from lessons learned in Afghanistan. We’ve built it to be the best.” \n \n This latest record, Furlong adds, has taken sniping “to a different level.” Canadian snipers are considered some of the best in the world in part because they are not simply taught to hit their targets. Like much of the Canadian military, many are trained with skills above their existing rank, in the sniper’s case as Unit Master Snipers, meaning they have the skills to design and run complex operations if the need ever arises. That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill. \n \n The practice of equipping soldiers with more than the skills they will need on the battlefield has served the Canadian military well. In Afghanistan, the results were clear. Maclean’s witnessed firsthand how soldiers out on patrol, sometimes for days in enemy territory, operated as closely knit teams. Command decisions were made with input from different ranks, offering multiple perspectives to patrol commanders. \n \n The level of training Canada provides its soldiers, particularly its elite JTF2 commandos, is the driving force behind Canada’s reputation for fielding a highly skilled and intellectually capable military. \n \n “This is a very important point,” says Chris Kilford, a retired Canadian artillery officer and now a fellow at the Queen’s University Centre for International and Defence Policy. “I have been very impressed with the young people in our special forces that I have interacted with overseas. Corporals and master corporals: bright and articulate. I also think that in general our people are often capable of working at a higher level than the rank on their shoulder.” \n \n Furlong agrees, adding that Canadian soldiers are more “cross-trained” than many other soldiers in the world, and Canada’s snipers specifically are given every opportunity to pursue leadership training that refines their mental capabilities, a key component to the psychologically demanding job they do. \n \n Still, there are the naysayers. Warrant Officer Oliver Cromwell, an instructor at the infantry school at CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick* who has taught sniper courses, cautions that more information is needed before the 3,450 meter distance is confirmed. \n \n “There is a difference between slant angle range and true range,” he says. “Slant angle range—if the shooter is at an elevated position relative to the target—may appear longer that the true range, sometimes twice the true distance. I don’t want to be a naysayer but those are just the facts.” \n \n Some online message boards have have also questioned the validity of the new record. In one case a contributor to a military discussion suggested the sniper likely fired into a crowd of ISIS fighters and happened to hit one. \n \n But Furlong points out that these types of distances, 3,000 metres and more, are regularly achieved on the shooting range. \n \n “It’s not an impossible distance,” he says. “The difference is between a shooting range and a battlefield. They are two completely different environments. The pressure these guys are under is huge. So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.” \n \n As for the men who accomplished it—snipers work in pairs, including a spotter—Furlong says they probably didn’t realize what they had done until later. “When we broke the record, we didn’t know until we got back to base,” he says. “To be honest, I didn’t really care, neither when I broke it or when mine was broken. Records are made to be broken.” \n \n Still, unless there are major advances in equipment, Furlong adds, this one should stand for a long time. \n \n CORRECTION, June 29, 2017: This story originally stated the location of CFB Gagetown.

The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers ""are not simply taught to hit their targets."" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to ""design and run complex operations"" if necessary. ""That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill."" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. ""The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt."" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. ""A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,"" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: ""A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.” Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: “It’s not an impossible distance,” he says. “So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.” It's a ""hell of a shot,"" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a ""large cigar."" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war.

Nothing seems to apply. \n \n There’s no playbook, after all, for two women in their 70s who’ve just found out they were switched at birth. \n \n “It’s a crazy thing,” Denice says. “People just automatically assume they got the right family.” \n \n Linda Jourdeans points to herself in a family photo. (Photo: Boyd Huppert, KARE 11) \n \n Only a few weeks have passed since Denice and Linda learned they didn’t, as infants, go home with the right family. \n \n In the journey that brought them to this strange place, Denice, who lives in Eagan, took the first step. \n \n Already an ancestry buff, the 72-year-old grandmother submitted DNA to the genealogy website 23andMe, hoping to learn more about her health history. \n \n A few weeks later, when her list of DNA relatives arrived, she was taken aback. \n \n “I didn't match anybody,” she said. Actually, Denice matched several people, but not one name among them she’d ever heard of. \n \n Denice Juneski (left) and Linda Jourdeans recently learned they were switched at birth.

(Photo: Boyd Huppert, KARE 11) \n \n Linda didn’t waste any time. “I did my DNA right away, because I've got to see this on paper,” she said. \n \n The DNA provided the proof. A 72-year secret had been uncovered. \n \n Denice and Linda quickly put together the pieces. \n \n In the early morning hours of December 19, 1945, at Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul, two baby girls were born: Denice Mary Mayer at 2:17 a.m. and Linda Jean Nielsen, 31 minutes later. \n \n How exactly they were switched, is probably lost to the ages. \n \n “We'll never know,” Linda said, “and I'm sure the nurses are dead that probably took care of us.” \n \n This is known: For 72 years, Denice and Linda have unknowingly walked in each other’s footsteps. \n \n Linda Jourdeans (lower right) was the only redhead in her family. (Photo furnished by: Linda Jourdeans) \n \n Family photos offer anecdotal support for the DNA’s scientific conclusion. Linda, the redhead, is pictured growing up in a family of blondes - while Denice, the blonde, is surrounded by brunettes and redheads in pictures with her siblings and cousins. \n \n Denice, lacking both stamina and coordination, found herself in a family of athletes. \n \n For years, her father played baseball around the Twin Cities, including a stint with the St. Paul Saints. Her brother was a ballplayer, too. Denice’s sister is in the Minnesota Softball Hall of Fame. \n \n “Sometimes I had that sense that I didn't quite fit in,” Denice said. \n \n Denice Juneski (far left) was the lone blonde in her family. (Photo furnished by: Denice Juneski) \n \n But Linda would have fit in quite nicely. The only athlete in her family, Linda played softball into her 50s. \n \n For seven decades they’d been living each other’s life, even answering to each other's name. \n \n “I was really supposed to be another person,” Denice said. \n \n Baby photo of Denice Juneski. (Photo furnished by: Denice Juneski) \n \n Linda’s daughter, Michelle, may have been the least surprised. “You don’t look like the rest,” she used to tell her mother. In 2002, she went as far as checking public birth records, but eventually dropped her pursuit. \n \n Since finding each other in April, Denice and Linda have met several times. They have someone in common. At 99 and in memory care, Marianne Mayer is now getting visits from Denice, the daughter she raised, and Linda, the daughter to whom she gave birth. \n \n The women retell the story on every visit. Marianne seems accepting of what happened and enjoys the company of both. \n \n “Now you have more grandchildren - red haired ones,” Denice says, as mother and daughters share a laugh. \n \n Marianne Mayer, 99, gets a visit from the daughter she raised and the daughter to whom she gave birth. (Photo: Boyd Huppert, KARE 11) \n \n Rochelle Nielsen, the other mother in the hospital that 1945 morning, died of cancer at 42. \n \n “She's been gone so long,” Linda says, wiping away tears. \n \n At 17 Linda lost a mother. At 72 she found another. \n \n “Unbelievable,” Linda says. \n \n Linda Jourdeans holds a photo of the mother who raised her, Rochelle Nielsen. (Photo: Boyd Huppert, KARE 11) \n \n Despite the shock, Denice and Linda agree it was better to find out about the mistake, than remain in the dark. \n \n Denice says good things are already coming of it. “I consider it a gift,” she says. \n \n They’ve begun meeting the families to which they should have belonged. Later this month, members of both families plan to attend a reunion where the introductions will continue. \n \n As for what to call the bond that now connects them, “We’re just new friends,” Linda said, as Denice nods in agreement. \n \n You'd probably be friends too with the person who's been tending to your life."", 'The art of the ""big lie"" is to repeat something often enough, and with a powerful enough megaphone, such that your distortions are not challenged. So it is with the Wall Street Journal\'s obsession with attacking and misrepresenting the multiple cases that I brought against both AIG and its former chairman and CEO, Hank Greenberg. \n \n At stake is much more than the particular cases at issue. By trying to rewrite the narrative of the economic cataclysm we have lived through, the deniers are attempting to challenge the common-sense conclusions that flow from an accurate understanding of history. They are desperately trying to protect a particularly rabid, and ultimately damaging, anti-regulatory philosophy that has dominated the past 30 years. They are trying to protect a broken and misguided understanding of how markets really function, a view now openly rejected even by such staunch free-market advocates as Judge Richard Posner and former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. Acknowledging the propriety of any government prosecutions of corporate wrongdoing would make impossible their current effort to push back against even the government\'s minimal responses to the financial crisis. \n \n So, in view of the Journal\'s recent editorial, a few facts are in order: Greenberg was removed as CEO of AIG by his own board—of its own volition—after his refusal to answer questions about his involvement in fraudulent reinsurance contracts that his company had created. Five people were convicted by a jury in Connecticut in 2008 for their role in these frauds. The federal prosecutor, in his summation, called Greenberg an unindicted co-conspirator in the scheme. In New York, the judge who will hear the case based on these facts, brought by the state when I was attorney general, called the case ""devastating"" and referred to AIG as a ""criminal enterprise."" AIG as a corporate entity settled the case with my office in 2006 by restating its financial results and paying a fine of $1.6 billion. Shareholders are now awaiting judicial approval of an additional $750 million settlement to compensate them for damages they suffered from these accounting frauds. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Contrary to the claims of the Journal\'s editorial, the cases against Greenberg and AIG have been both proper and successful. More to the point, perhaps, they have been necessary to the vindication of justice and ethics in the marketplace. \n \n The Journal\'s editorial also seeks to disparage the cases my office brought against Marsh & McLennan for a range of financial and business crimes. The editorial notes that two of the cases against employees of the company were dismissed after the defendants had been convicted. The judge found that certain evidence that should have been turned over to the defense was not. (The cases were tried after my tenure as attorney general.) Unfortunately for the credibility of the Journal, the editorial fails to note the many employees of Marsh who have been convicted and sentenced to jail terms, or that Marsh\'s behavior was a blatant abuse of law and market power: price-fixing, bid-rigging, and kickbacks all designed to harm their customers and the market while Marsh and its employees pocketed the increased fees and kickbacks. Marsh as a company paid an $850 million fine to resolve the claims and brought in new leadership. At the time of the criminal conduct, Jeff Greenberg, Hank Greenberg\'s son, was the CEO of Marsh. He was forced to resign. \n \n What does it mean that supposedly thoughtful voices in the corporate world continue to deny the simple fact that irresponsible behavior should be addressed head on, and the rules of conduct altered sufficiently to permit a sound foundation for future economic growth? \n \n I fear that we have still not constructed a social contract or general understanding of the role of government in the marketplace that will bring things into balance—in terms of both individual behavior and collective responsibility. Maybe we are still living in the remaining hours of a fading regime, still addled by the warped perspective of too many who have done perhaps too well over the past decade or two. A case in point is Steve Schwarzman, the founder and CEO of Blackstone, a private equity firm. Schwarzman recently compared the attempt to tax the often astronomical fees earned by private equity managers as ordinary income—as they should be—to Hitler\'s invasion of Poland. This horrific statement, from someone who spent millions of dollars on his own birthday party, is an unfortunate reminder of the mind-set of at least some pockets of our corporate leadership. It is time for more enlightened voices in the corporate world to use their own megaphones. \n \n Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. \n \n Like Slate on Facebook.

KARE reports that as Minnesota's Juneski was puzzling over her test results from 23andMe, a woman in a nearby town in Wisconsin took her own DNA test. Linda Jourdeans' results showed that ""M. Mayer"" was her mother—but that wasn't the woman who had raised her, she tells KARE. The murkiness of this all soon cleared up: Juneski and Jourdeans had been somehow switched at birth sometime after being born on Dec. 19, 1945, at Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul, Minn. The news offered context for things both women had long noticed: Juneski was the only blonde among redheads and brunettes, while Jourdeans, a redhead, was surrounded by lighter-haired kin. Juneski said she also felt out of place in a family of athletes, while Jourdeans was the only athlete in her family. The women tracked each other down in April and have since met a few times, and they're celebrating their special new bond. ""I consider it a gift,"" Juneski says.

235,"['President Trump: Kennedy Retirement Makes Senate Control \'Vital\' For Republicans \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \n \n During a rally in North Dakota Wednesday night, President Trump underscored the importance of protecting the GOP\'s Senate majority this fall, deeming it especially critical in the wake of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy\'s retirement. \n \n ""Justice Kennedy\'s retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time — the most important thing we can do,"" Trump told a crowd in Fargo. \n \n The president was there to campaign for Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, who\'s challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in one of the GOP\'s top opportunities to pick up a Senate seat. North Dakota is one of 10 states that Trump carried in 2016 in which Democratic incumbents are up for re-election — and he won North Dakota by about 36 points. \n \n Trump argued that Cramer would support his agenda and, most importantly, his court picks, while Heitkamp will not. \n \n ""Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court. She will be told to do so,"" Trump said. \n \n Heitkamp, however, was one of three Democrats to vote in favor of Trump\'s first Supreme Court nominee, now-Justice Neil Gorsuch. \n \n Trump didn\'t directly mention that vote, but did later claim that sometimes Heitkamp would give Republicans and the White House a ""quickie vote"" but that ""the day after that election, she\'s voting party line, 100 percent."" \n \n NPR Politics Podcast Analysis: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy\'s Retirement Analysis: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy\'s Retirement Listen · 22:57 22:57 \n \n In a statement after the rally, Heitkamp pushed back, saying she would continue to be her own person in the Senate, election year or not. \n \n ""Anytime the president comes to North Dakota, that\'s a good thing for our state. While we saw election-year politics today, I\'m always willing to work with the president if he\'s helping North Dakota — and if he\'s not, I\'ll speak up,"" Heitkamp said. ""I don\'t answer to a political party or president, I only answer to North Dakotans, who deserve an independent voice in the Senate. That\'s why I\'ve always been eager to work across the aisle — including with the president — to get results for our state, and today\'s rally hasn\'t changed that."" \n \n Trump continued to tie Heitkamp to the national party throughout the rally nonetheless. \n \n ""When Heidi ran for office, she promised to be an independent vote for the people of North Dakota. Instead, she went to Washington and immediately joined Chuck — you know who Chuck is,"" Trump said, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ""and Nancy,"" that is, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Trump also railed on Democrats\' ""new leader,"" Maxine Waters, hitting the liberal California congresswoman who came under fire even from her own leadership in her call for public confrontations against Trump administration officials. \n \n Trump hit on many of his favorite subjects during the freewheeling rally — immigration, tax cuts, trade, the economy, reveling in his 2016 victory, boasting about the size of the crowd and more. But the Kennedy retirement hung over the night, and Trump also took time in his remarks to honor the retiring justice — an unpredictable swing vote who hasn\'t always been a favorite of conservatives despite being nominated by President Ronald Reagan. Trump called Kennedy a ""very special guy"" and promised that he would pick someone with ""intellect"" as his successor, someone he suggested could serve on the court for 40 or more years. \n \n ""I\'m very honored that he chose to [retire] during my term in office. He felt confident in me to make the right choice to carry on his great legacy,"" Trump said. \n \n Heitkamp and other red state Democrats will play a crucial role in determining how much resistance a new Supreme Court nominee is met with. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — who controversially blocked President Obama\'s nominee to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia until after the 2016 election, allowing Trump to fill the seat with Gorsuch — has indicated he wants a vote ahead of the 2018 midterms. But Democrats have called such a decision hypocrisy, given McConnell\'s insistence against holding a confirmation hearing during an election year. \n \n The Senate is currently split 51-49 for Republicans, but Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been absent for months battling brain cancer, so the margin for error is even smaller. There are some GOP wildcard votes too — Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski support abortion rights, and one reason Trump supporters are cheering a Kennedy replacement — and Democrats are so fearful — is the belief that a new justice could help overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion. \n \n Along with Heitkamp, Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana also voted to confirm Gorsuch last year — and the trio of often centrist Democrats are considered some of the most endangered Senate incumbents in November\'s elections. Given their re-election concerns, they could be under pressure to do so again with Trump\'s new Supreme Court nominee. Even so, Trump made it clear with Heitkamp on Wednesday night, that won\'t earn them a pass ahead of the November elections from him or Republicans.', 'President Donald Trump said that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy made the decision to retire because “he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy.” \n \n “I’m very honored he chose to do it during my term in office,” Trump told supporters at a campaign appearance in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday evening. \n \n Kennedy, 81, was nominated in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and served 30 years on the Supreme Court, where he was known as a centrist influence. While he voted with the bench’s conservatives on campaign finance and, earlier this week, to uphold Trump’s travel ban, Kennedy also sided with the Court’s liberal justices on issues such as abortion rights, climate change and authoring the majority opinion to legalize same-sex marriage in 2015. \n \n Read more: How Anthony Kennedy’s Swing Vote Made Him ‘the Decider’ \n \n Kennedy’s retirement gives the Trump administration an opening to swing the balance of the court for decades. Trump told the crowd in North Dakota that he would nominate a judge that’s “going to that be there for 40, 45 years.” \n \n “Remember this, so we have a pick to come up, we have to pick a great one,” Trump said. “We need intellect, we need so many things.” \n \n Trump has already contributed a young, conservative justice to the court: Neil Gorsuch, 50, who is known for his confrontational style and consistently conservative voting record. Gorsuch was confirmed last year after Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings on President Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised Wednesday that a vote on Kennedy’s replacement would take place as soon as this fall, according to the Associated Press. \n \n Read more: Why Democrats Want Want to Wait to Replace Anthony Kennedy \n \n Trump told reporters Wednesday that he would select a name from a list of 25 potential nominees that the White House compiled last year.', '“Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court,” President Donald Trump said in North Dakota. “And because of this she will be forced to vote yes.

Yet it’s this image that finally allowed a medical team to understand why the child was vomiting and fatigued and ultimately save his life. \n \n Hanhang, 1, was walking around with a chopstick when he tripped and fell, according to CEN. \n \n The long stick drove up his nose and his parents quickly removed the object and took him to the hospital. \n \n Doctors examined Hanhang and failed to notice that the chopstick had punctured the brain and small pieces were still lodged in his head. \n \n “When we got home after our first visit to the hospital, my husband broke all the chopsticks in half and threw them away as we were worried something like this could happen again,” Yu Liao, Hanhang’s 25-year-old mom told CEN. \n \n “But we had no idea there was still one inside of his head,” she said. \n \n At home, Hanhang’s condition worsened as he repeatedly vomited and was noticeably lethargic. \n \n His parents brought him back to the hospital where doctors ordered an X-ray and discovered the chopstick piece. \n \n “We were beside ourselves with worry,” Liao said. \n \n “After removing the remaining six centimeters his condition improved immediately, but he does have a brain infection so will be staying in the hospital for further treatment,” Dr. Li Shaovi told CEN. \n \n Kids and chopsticks can be a dangerous combination. A 2-year-old Chinese boy stuck a chopstick in his nose last year and it penetrated three inches into his brain. Doctors spent four hours carefully removing it. Also, last year a 12-year-old Chinese boy was running across a school playground when he fell over onto a pair of chopsticks in his hand. The sticks penetrated his neck and the boy underwent surgery to remove them. \n \n Note to parents: Chopsticks are to only be handled by children sitting at the dinner table.""]",4,"– President Trump praised Anthony Kennedy during a rally in North Dakota Wednesday evening and said he is ""honored"" the Supreme Court justice made his bombshell retirement decision when he did.

As NPR reports, Trump also has begun casting the issue as an crucial one in the 2018 midterms, arguing that it's more important than ever that the GOP retain its grip on the Senate. ""Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time—the most important thing we can do,"" Trump told the crowd. He was there stumping for Rep. Kevin Cramer, the GOP challenger to Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who is seen as one of the most vulnerable incumbent Democrats given that she represents a red state. ""Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court,"" he said, though NPR notes she was one of three Democrats to vote in favor of Trump's first pick, Neil Gorsuch."

Ulbricht, 29, collected tens of millions of dollars in commissions, investigators said, and twice ordered people killed in a bid to protect his empire. \n \n LATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Audio: Southwest Flight 1380 emergency landing via Broadcastify \n \n Warriors prepare for Game 2 against the San Antonio Spurs San Francisco Chronicle \n \n NBA Playoffs Game 2 – Getting Ready Scott Strazzante / The Chronicle \n \n NBA Playoffs Game 2 – Fans Jessica Christian / The Chronicle \n \n Time lapse of Salesforce Tower being built Alex Orellana \n \n 3821 Alemany Blvd San Francisco CA San Francisco Chronicle \n \n Hailstorm strikes Oakland and East Bay Twitter \n \n Klay Thompson San Francisco Chronicle \n \n Motorists drive through hailstorm in Oakland Twitter / @taibori \n \n 3239A Louise Street Oakland Presented By Daniel Winkler San Francisco Chronicle \n \n The Texas native and San Francisco transplant didn\'t resist as he was taken into custody Tuesday at the Glen Park library branch, officials said. \n \n In a complaint filed in New York and a parallel grand jury indictment handed down in Maryland, federal prosecutors accused him of charges including narcotics trafficking, money laundering and attempting to murder a witness. \n \n They said his business, while operating in a dark corner of the Internet, was penetrated by undercover agents. \n \n The FBI said Ulbricht ran Silk Road from San Francisco, where he had been living for the past year, including at a cafe not far from his former Hayes Valley home. Since at least 2011, authorities said, he had facilitated the sale of heroin, cocaine and other drugs as ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" - a reference to a character in the film ""The Princess Bride"" who turns out to be not one man but rather a series of men passing down the title. \n \n Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who in 2011 asked federal agents to take down the site after it began to get media attention, applauded the arrest. \n \n ""Sayonara to Silk Road,"" Schumer said. ""The country is safer now that this open market for lawbreaking has been shuttered."" \n \n Change in goals \n \n Ulbricht has in the past railed against government control. After studying solar cells as a graduate student in Pennsylvania, he wrote on his LinkedIn profile that his goals had changed. \n \n ""The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort,"" he said. ""I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force."" \n \n That simulation, the government alleged, is Silk Road. \n \n Federal authorities had seized the website by the time Ulbricht appeared Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where he was remanded into custody pending a hearing Friday. His attorney declined to comment. \n \n Undercover buys \n \n The charges were the result of an investigation during which law-enforcement officials made more than 100 undercover purchases of drugs from Silk Road vendors from 10 countries, authorities said. The site itself didn\'t sell drugs, but connected sellers with buyers, who would generally ship items through the mail. \n \n FBI Special Agent Christopher Tarbell described the website in an affidavit as a ""sprawling black-market bazaar."" Users could only access Silk Road using the Tor network - technology that was first developed by the U.S. Navy and conceals communications. Tor browser software can be downloaded for free on the Internet. \n \n To pay for items, buyers used Bitcoins, an anonymous digital currency with no central bank or authority. Bitcoins - whose value plunged after news spread of Ulbricht\'s arrest - aren\'t illegal and are used in many legitimate ways, but the FBI noted that they\'ve been used by ""cyber-criminals for money-laundering purposes."" \n \n The Silk Road site had many of the trappings of popular online retail sites, like user comments, which sought to ward off shady dealers and undercover cops. It featured wares like ""amphetamine paste"" and ""high quality #4 heroin."" One commenter wrote after making a purchase that he ""had to snort almost triple the amount of this new stuff to get where I was with the old."" \n \n $1.2 billion in sales \n \n Over the past two years, Silk Road had been used by ""several thousand drug dealers and other unlawful vendors"" to sell ""hundreds of kilograms"" of illegal drugs, generating the Bitcoin equivalent of $1.2 billion in sales and $80 million in commissions, Tarbell wrote. At one point, Ulbricht hid behind the username ""altoid"" to marvel about Silk Road, describing it as an ""anonymous Amazon.com,"" investigators said. \n \n Authorities also alleged that Ulbricht sought to use violence to protect his domain. \n \n The Maryland grand jury indictment said a federal agent began communicating with Ulbricht in April 2012 while posing as a drug smuggler. Then in January, prosecutors said, Ulbricht paid the agent $80,000 to torture and kill a Silk Road employee who had stolen Bitcoins and had been arrested, prompting fears he would become a government witness. \n \n Ulbricht allegedly wrote to the agent that he had ""never killed a man or had one killed before, but it is the right move in this case."" \n \n In February, the agent sent staged photographs of the employee being tortured and a picture of the purported dead body, prosecutors said. \n \n Another try \n \n They said they found out later that Ulbricht soon sought to kill again. In March, Tarbell wrote, Ulbricht offered $150,000 to a Silk Road user ""to execute a murder-for-hire of another Silk Road user, who was threatening to release the identities of thousands of users of the site"" unless he was given $500,000. \n \n ""I wouldn\'t mind if he was executed,"" Ulbricht allegedly wrote. \n \n Ulbricht was again given a picture of the purportedly dead victim, a resident of British Columbia, but there were no reports of anyone having been killed there, the FBI said. \n \n ""Your problem has been taken care of,"" the reported hit man wrote in a message to Ulbricht, authorities said. ""Rest easy though, because he won\'t be blackmailing anyone again. Ever."" \n \n Ulbricht ""has acted as a law unto himself in deciding how to deal with problems affecting Silk Road, and that he has been willing to pursue violent means when he deems that the problem calls for it,"" Tarbell wrote. \n \n San Francisco operation \n \n Authorities said they identified Ulbricht by tracing his online activity. They said that in June he was living with a friend on Hickory Street in San Francisco\'s Hayes Valley, just 500 feet from an Internet cafe on Laguna Street ""from which someone logged into a server used to administer the Silk Road website."" \n \n By July, he had moved to 15th Street in San Francisco, where U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents visited him to see why a package for him that they had intercepted contained nine fake identification documents, all with his picture on it, authorities said. \n \n Ulbricht refused to discuss the counterfeit papers, the affidavit said, but ""volunteered that \'hypothetically\' anyone could go onto a website named \'Silk Road\' on \'Tor\' and purchase any drugs or fake identity documents the person wanted.""', 'The owner of the underground drug market Silk Road was a 29-year-old Libertarian engineer living in San Francisco raking in over $80 million in 2 years, according to the indictment revealed today. Who is the man behind the biggest underground drug market, and how did he get caught? The indictment lays out a detailed account of how Silk Road grew and how FBI agent Christopher Tarbell took it down. \n \n According to the indictment, Silk Road was bigger than anyone had suspected: It boasted over $1.6 billion in sales from 2011-2013, which resulted in $80 million in commissions. (Researchers had previously estimated that Silk Road was doing about $22 million in total sales per year.) According to the indictment, which claims that FBI agents obtained a mirror of the server that housed Silk Road\'s business from law enforcement in an unidentified foreign country, Ulbricht ""alone has controlled the massive profits generated from the operation of the business."" He used some of the profits to pay a team of administrators as much as $2,000 a week each. And yet, he only paid $1,000 a month in rent for his San Francisco apartment, according to the indictment. \n \n The most bizarre and spectacular allegation in the indictment is that Ulbricht solicited a murder-for-hire against a Silk Road user who was attempting to blackmail him. The user, FriendlyChemist, told Ulbricht—whose alleged online persona was ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" or DPR, a reference to the film The Princess Bride—that he had obtained a list of thousands of Silk Road users and was going to release them unless DPR paid off his $500,000 debt to another user, RedandWhite. Instead of paying the debt, DPR contacted RedAndWhite and paid him $150,000 in Bitcoins to off Friendly Chemist. \n \n ""In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn\'t mind if he was executed,"" DPR wrote. DPR even tried to bargain down FriendlyChemist, messaging: ""Don\'t want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80K."" DPR gave redandwhite the address of FriendlyChemist in British Columbia, and the indictment reports that redandwhite sent back photo evidence of the deed. But according to the indictment there is no indication the hit actually happened—""Although I believe the foregoing exchange demonstrates DPR\'s intention to solicit a murder-for-hire,"" Tarbell wrote, ""I have spoken with Canadian law enforcement authorities, who have no record of there being any Canadian resident with the name DPR passed to redandwhite as the target of the solicited murder-for-hire. Nor do they have any record of a homicide occurring in White Rock, British Columbia on or about March 31, 2013."" \n \n Currently the most-discussed aspect of the case on the Darknet is speculation on how Ulbricht got caught. Silk Road was hosted using the privacy-protecting Tor Network, and its brazen customers believed their digital tracks were hidden. But it appears that Ulbricht was tripped up by some security mistakes while promoting Silk Road in the early days. Tarbell found that the two earliest mentions of Silk Road were forum posts by a user called Altoid on the drug forum Shroomery.org and the semi-official Bitcoin Forum. Both were obvious astroturfing efforts to promote the Silk Road: \n \n ""Has anyone seen Silk Road yet?"" goes one. ""It\'s kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com. I don\'t think they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff. Let me know what you guys think."" Altoid was easily connected to Ulbricht by a post on the Bitcoin forum in which Altoid solicits programming help for a ""venture backed bit coin startup"" using the email address: Rossulbricht@gmail.com. From there, agents surveilled Ulbricht in real life and were able to match up his locations to locations used to log into the DPR account. They noticed that both Ulbricht and DPR were fans of the Libertarian Ludwig Von Mises Institute. And a key used to log into Silk Road\'s administrator account was linked to another email address Ulbricht had used. \n \n The feds also managed to gain access to servers belonging to Silk Road. They spied on the traffic in real time, determining that from Feb 2011 to July 2013 there were 2013 1,229,465 transactions on the site, and 957,079 total registered users. This raises the question of exactly how much information they have on Silk Road\'s users, and whether more busts are to come. (Agents made over 100 undercover transactions throughout the investigation, according to the indictment.) \n \n Browsing Ulbricht\'s social media accounts show a pretty normal, nerdy guy. Ulbricht graduated from the University of Texas in 2006 with a degree in Physics and went to the University of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania State University for grad school, where he studied engineering and wrote a master\'s thesis on ""Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy."" According to property records, he owned a home in State College, PA, which he sold in 2010 for $187,0000. Curiously, the indictment misidentifies his grad school as the University of Pennsylvania. \n \n He\'s got a Facebook page full of beer pong pics and, of course, was a vocal supporter of Ron Paul, donating $200 to his campaign in 2007. ""He doesn\'t compromise his integrity as a politician and he fights quite diligently to restore the principles that our country was founded on,"" Ulbricht told the Penn State student newspaper in 2008. \n \n Last year in a YouTube video for the storytelling project StoryCorps with his friend Rene Pinnell. Pinnell, speaking to the Verge, was adamant about his friend\'s innocence: ""I don\'t know how they messed it up and I don\'t know how they got Ross wrapped into this, but I\'m sure it\'s not him,"" he said.']",2,"– Alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht was no ordinary drug boss—he paid $1,000 a month for a San Francisco apartment he shared with two roommates, used an alias from the Princess Bride, and was arrested in the sci-fi section of his public library.

237,"['NEW YORK (AP) — The newly appointed commissioner of New York City\'s jail system violated city law by sending as many as 47 mentally ill inmates into 23-hour confinement without first getting approval from mental health clinicians, a city oversight board said Tuesday. \n \n Commissioner Joseph Ponte, who took the helm of the country\'s second-largest jail system in March, insisted at a meeting of the New York City Board of Correction he was trying to quell rising levels of violence. \n \n Ponte, who had reduced the use of solitary confinement by two thirds in Maine\'s state prisons, said the June 13 move on Rikers Island was aimed at volatile inmates who have broken jailhouse rules and owe days in solitary. \n \n But board members rejected the argument, noting the move jeopardized the health of some inmates, particularly those on psychotropic medications who were taken from air-conditioned mental observation units and put into uncooled solitary cells. A federal judge has ordered that such inmates, deemed heat-sensitive because the exposure to heat while on such drugs can be fatal, shouldn\'t be placed in uncooled cells. \n \n Other inmates who were moved were denied medication and had seizure disorders, they said. At least one inmate suffered a seizure, Ponte said. \n \n ""I would just hope that you would review these issues and in the future instruct your staff to be consistent with the board standards and not to violate these rules which are not just rules but designed for the safety of the prisoners,"" said board member Dr. Robert Cohen. \n \n Nearly 40 percent of the roughly 11,500 daily inmates in city jails have a mental health diagnosis, according to the Department of Correction and about a third of them suffer from serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The Associated Press has previously disclosed the deaths of two mentally ill inmates — one who essentially baked to death in a 101-degree cell in February — that have prompted calls for reform. \n \n During a City Council oversight hearing on violence and mental illness at Rikers the day before the inmate moves, Ponte was repeatedly asked about a list of hundreds of inmates who owe time in solitary confinement but are in general population because there\'s not enough space. Correction officials argue that those inmates, many of whom they say are gang members, drive the violence on Rikers. \n \n On Tuesday, Ponte told board members that figure is closer to 1,000 inmates. A number of them are high-risk for harming themselves and others and needed to be separated to stem surging violence, he said. \n \n ""What we don\'t have, and have not had for probably more than five years now, is a plan that\'s impacted the level of violence on Rikers Island,"" he told the board. \n \n There were 21 slashings in one recent six-week period and a total of 87 during fiscal year 2014, according to a letter sent by Ponte to board members Monday night and obtained by the AP. There were a total of 68 total such slashing the previous fiscal year and 55 in fiscal 2012, the letter said. \n \n ""Under such circumstances, I felt that it was imperative to take prompt action to prevent further violence,"" he wrote.', '“This will kill the Senate,” thundered Mitch McConnell, rising in opposition to Democratic plans to reform the filibuster. Would that it were true! The Senate exists because the Founding Fathers, who hated the idea of a Senate, gave in to threats from small-state senators demanding disproportionate representation. \n \n Sadly, Democrats are not about to kill the Senate. They’re not even going to kill the filibuster. What they’re threatening to do is to eliminate the newest and most abusive use of the filibuster. In addition to massively expanding the use of the filibuster to block legislation, Senate Republicans have started using it to block qualified executive branch nominees in order to block the execution of laws they find distasteful. \n \n Senate Republicans object to existing labor laws and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. But they also lack the votes to pass changes to them. Instead, they have announced that they will block any nominee to vacant spots in those agencies — not just those deemed unfit or ideologically extreme — which has effectively paralyzed them from carrying out their work, unless Obama agrees to change the laws to suit the GOP. Senate Republicans have managed to largely paralyze labor law and financial reform this way. \n \n Congressional scholars Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein have called this “the new nullification” — which is to say, a radical tactic to prevent the execution of duly passed laws. McConnell, unsurprisingly, loathes Ornstein, a consummate establishmentarian who has taken the unusual step of fingering Republicans in general and McConnell in particular as the primary agents of Washington dysfunction: \n \n Senate Democrats are threatening to change the rules of the Senate to allow executive branch nominees to be seated with a simple majority vote. They’re doing it now for several reasons: It’s taken years for the excesses of this tactic to wear down Senate Democrats\' inertia. The Senate just passed immigration reform and has no other pending bills that might be threatened if the place blows up. And Democrats are laying the groundwork for Obama to devote his term mainly to executing unilateral laws, not futilely trying to reason with Congress. Obama needs to staff his administration to do this. \n \n In a fiery speech, McConnell made a series of arguments against this change. One is that Democrats should worry about what will happen when Republicans want to nominate people they don’t like: “They’re not even interested in what this would mean down the road when Republicans are the ones making the nominations.” \n \n Well, yes, it would prevent Democrats from blocking a Republican president’s attempts to fill his own administration. Democrats did block numerous Bush administration executive branch appointments for various reasons, though never as leverage to force Bush to change the law. The next Republican president will be able to fill out his own administration with a simple majority Senate vote. Not so scary! \n \n McConnell’s other argument is insanely Orwellian. The issue, he says, is just a handful of “illegal” administration appointments. There’s a short backstory you need to know to understand what an insane argument McConnell is making here. Presidents often respond to blocked nominees by appointing them when Congress is in recess. Congress blocked Obama from doing this by holding pro forma sessions during its recess, which Democrats also used against Republicans. Obama tried to circumvent that tactic by declaring the pro forma sessions (when one Republican was around to gavel in and gavel out) a sham. The Republican-majority D.C. Circuit Court ruled against this tactic. \n \n Here is how McConnell puts it: ""So this isn’t really a fight over nominees at all. It’s a fight over these illegal, unconstitutional nominees."" \n \n But of course they’re only illegal nominees in the first place because McConnell insisted he wouldn’t seat them without changes to the laws they carry out. The attempt to seat them during a sham recess isn’t the cause of the conflict. The cause is McConnell’s blocking of otherwise acceptable nominees in order to force Obama to accept changes to the law he wouldn’t otherwise sign. \n \n The deeper subtext of McConnell’s argument is not one aimed at the public but at his fellow senators. It’s that the Senate is wonderful and unique, and any changes to its byways would threaten the character of the institution they all love so dearly. This is a deeply held belief by senators. In Washington, senators occupy a place of immense power and political security, catered to by sycophants at every turn, and basking across parties in their senatorial splendor and superiority to the common House. It is certainly true that, for the purposes of maintaining a dignified lifestyle for 100 senators, the Senate continues to function brilliantly. What’s very hard to defend is that the Senate functions perfectly as a vehicle for advancing the national interest.']",2,"– Guards at Rikers Island don't just neglect the mentally ill or let them bake to death, they also routinely brutally beat them, often without suffering any repercussions, a New York Times investigation has discovered. The Times uncovered a secret report compiled by a city department this year that found that 129 Rikers inmates suffered ""serious injuries"" in altercations with staff members over an 11-month span last year; 77% of those inmates had a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, the inmates were beaten while handcuffed. The Times investigated the incidents individually, and offer some disturbing details: When guards found Jose Bautista trying to hang himself, they saved him, but then allegedly threw him to the ground and punched him with such force that they perforated his bowel. It was one of five beatings noted in the report that followed a suicide attempt. Bautista needed emergency surgery, but guards took nine hours to drive him to the hospital—which is only 15 minutes away. When Andre Lane threw water or urine at guards, they allegedly handcuffed him to a gurney, wheeled him to a clinic that wasn't monitored by security cameras, and beat him so violently that the walls and cabinets were covered with his blood. After Brian Mack complained that guards were stealing inmates' food, a guard captain allegedly hit him in the eye with his radio, while another officer punched him in the jaw. He came away with a broken eye socket and jaw. Correction officials said he'd been in a fight with another inmate, but investigators noted no such fight was logged in prison records. None of the guards involved in any of the cases have faced criminal charges—or even administrative ones. Rikers has been under pressure to reform its treatment of mentally ill inmates—in January, for example, it announced it would stop putting the ""seriously mentally ill"" in solitary, though the Times notes that classification applies to a small segment of the population. Last week an oversight board said the newly-appointed city jail commissioner had in June illegally sent as many as 47 mentally ill Rikers inmates to solitary without consulting clinicians, the AP reports."
238,"['His grandfather had lovingly given him his name, hoping that one day he would grow up into a ‘positive’ human being. Some 25 years later, the marine engineer from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is despondent on being forced to bear the burden of his name. \n \n Two years after passing out as a marine engineer from Tamil Nadu’s Noorul Islam University, Saddam Hussain says he has failed to find a job because of his namesake: the former Iraqi ruler executed in 2006. Saddam Hussein was a dictator blamed for atrocities on his subjects until toppled by the US in 2003. \n \n “People are scared to hire me,” laments Jamshedpur’s Saddam. His job application has been rejected each of the 40-odd times he has appeared for interviews with multinational shipping companies. His batchmates around the world have secured employment, but Saddam remains unemployed despite ranking second in his batch of 2014. \n \n For the initial six months, Saddam was unable to decipher why he was being rejected. “I then inquired with the HR departments of the companies and some of them told me my name was the problem,” he recounts. He was told that having a crew member with a name that arouses instant suspicion could be an operational nightmare. \n \n A top executive of Delhi-based TeamLease Services, a leading recruitment consultant, agrees. “If the issue involves crossing the borders, then nothing can be done as border patrol and airport authorities are very process-driven and if there is a red flag, they will check out. If the person’s job involves frequent travel abroad, he might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,” he points out. \n \n “Even Shah Rukh Khan gets detained at US airports. What is this Saddam in comparision?” he asks. \n \n Getting rid of the name is proving to be a bigger nightmare. \n \n Once it hit him that his name was the impediment, Saddam legally got his name changed into Sajid and procured all relevant documents, including passport, voter ID and driving licence, under the name. \n \n But his woes did not end there. \n \n Prospective employers ask for his educational certificates, but his university has refused to change the name until he got his Class 10 and 12 exam certificates changed first. He approached the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for a name change, but the authorities have not acted yet. \n \n Driven to desperation, Saddam, now Sajid, moved the Jharkhand high court with a plea to direct the CBSE to change his name. But since unscrupulous people often abuse the system by frequently changing names, the court acted with caution. Last week, it set the date for a considered hearing on May 5. \n \n Saddam remains fond of his grandfather, though he feels he is paying for his folly. As one by one his batchmates set sail after securing jobs, Saddam is left to spend sleepless nights. “I am an innocent victim of somebody else’s crimes,” he says. \n \n First Published: Mar 21, 2017 07:52 IST', 'Image copyright AP Image caption Saddam may no longer be around, but many of his namesakes do not have an easy time \n \n More than 10 years after being executed, Saddam Hussein remains a huge presence in the life of one man. \n \n The marine engineer in India does not blame his grandfather for giving him the Iraqi dictator\'s name 25 years ago. \n \n But after being refused a job some 40-odd times, he has concluded employers are loath to hire him - even if his name is marginally different - spelt Hussain, not Hussein. \n \n So he went to court to become Sajid. But the wheels of bureaucracy are turning slowly - and so is his search for a job. \n \n It may never have opened many doors in India - and has raised eyebrows and grins elsewhere - but one thing was guaranteed: a name like Saddam Hussain was not likely to pass unnoticed. \n \n Two years after graduating from Tamil Nadu\'s Noorul Islam University, the man from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is feeling the strain. \n \n He did well at college, and his classmates have already found jobs, but shipping companies turn him away. \n \n ""People are scared to hire me,"" Saddam-turned-Sajid is quoted by Hindustan Times as saying. \n \n He says they fear complications from an encounter with immigration officials across international borders. \n \n Saddam thought he might easily get around this obstacle, by getting a new passport, driving licence and more. \n \n But his job applications are still not proceeding smoothly as he cannot provide proof, under his new name, that he went to school - and this is proving to be a time-consuming exercise. \n \n Another court hearing beckons on 5 May, this time to force authorities to change the name on his secondary school certificates, after which his graduation papers will need amending. \n \n Sajid is not alone in his plight - but he may feel more aggrieved than the numerous Saddam Husseins of Iraq, who feel cursed with a name that was originally given in tribute to a leader whose legacy is one of a brutal dictator. \n \n Being Saddam in Iraq \n \n One Saddam, a journalist working in Ramadi, a Sunni city in the desert province of Anbar, said his father was fired from his government job because he could not convince his superiors he was not a member of the dictator\'s Ba\'ath party. \n \n He had named his son Saddam, after all - what greater allegiance could he have shown to the ousted president, they argued. \n \n Others had more terrifying stories - one said he was captured by a Shia militia, set down on his knees and had the barrel of a gun placed against the back of his head. Somehow, thanks to sheer luck, the weapon jammed, and the militia eventually released him. \n \n One friend told me how, as a Kurdish schoolchild in Baghdad, he had known a fellow classmate named Saddam Hussein. \n \n While playing football with the boy, they would often shout at him: ""It is not only us who hate you, the entire country hates you."" \n \n Read Prashant Rao\'s BBC article']",2,"– Saddam Hussain's name is making it difficult for him to get a job. ""People are scared to hire me,"" the 25-year-old Indian marine engineer tells the Hindustan Times. Hussain was, yes, named for that Saddam Hussein; the name was given to him by his grandfather. It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school. And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause ""suspicion."" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: ""He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,"" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see. He's working on getting those certificates changed as well, but the process is moving slowly, the BBC reports. (Meanwhile, in America, a guy is trying to change his name to Hitler.)"
239,"[""SOCHI, RUSSIA -- Three points from Portugal and Spain's remarkable 3-3 draw at Fisht Stadium in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a sublime hat-trick. \n \n 1. Ronaldo's three goals earn Portugal a point \n \n For a guy whose deeds are so often defined by numbers, whether it's the fact that he has more goals than games for Real Madrid or the fact that nobody has more Ballon d'Or awards stashed away in his trophy cabinet, there was one that seemed out of sync before this World Cup began: three, as in the number of goals that Cristiano Ronaldo had scored in the World Cup to date. \n \n Yet he remedied that perceived dearth against Spain Friday, nabbing a hat-trick in a 3-3 draw to open their World Cup campaign. The first was a penalty he won himself, his nifty stopover prompting Nacho to dangle a leg over which Ronaldo gleefully fell. The second was a gift from David De Gea, who pushed his edge-of-the-box snap shot over the goal line, though again, there's something to be said for Ronaldo's alertness on the break that he was there to capitalize on Goncalo Guedes' layoff following Pepe's defensive clearance. The third was a magisterial free kick that disappeared into the top corner, leaving De Gea flat-footed. \n \n Ronaldo joins Miroslav Klose, Uwe Seeler and Pele as the only players who have scored in four World Cups. He also becomes the oldest player to score a hat-trick in World Cup history, at 33 years and 131 days. And he equals the legendary Ferenc Puskas, the most prolific European-born international goalscorer in history and the second most-prolific overall. (Iran's Ali Daei, at 109, may not be entirely out of his reach either.) \n \n He has broad shoulders, this one, which is a good thing, as a nation is riding on his back. \n \n Cristiano Ronaldo has a whole host of records for Real Madrid and Portugal. ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images) \n \n 2. Diego Costa's heroics stand out for Spain \n \n He has, at times, looked like a foreign object in a Spain shirt. Even as Julen Lopetegui's side romped through qualification to the World Cup, Diego Costa managed just nine appearances, lasting 90 minutes on just three occasions. But against Portugal he showed just how much value there is in him being so different. \n \n The first goal was vintage Costa: the angry forearm clear-out on Pepe, the deceptively quick legs to send Jose Fonte the wrong way, the threaded smash between two opponents. The second carried his hallmark too, as he used his physicality and hunger to get to the ball first and nudge it past Rui Patricio. The rest was selflessness, sacrifice and running battles with Pepe and Fonte, but always on the right side of VAR. \n \n Just what Spain needed. \n \n 3. A fair result for both teams \n \n The table shows Iran leading the group following their late 1-0 win against Morocco. But beyond the drama of a see-saw game -- one of the best group openers we've seen in a long time -- and the fact that they are two points off the top, there are positive takeaways for both teams. \n \n Spain ultimately controlled much of the game and can chalk up two of the goals conceded to uncharacteristic individual errors. There's some tweaking to be done but the post-Lopetegui meltdown simply didn't materialize. \n \n As for Portugal, it was always going to be a dog-fight of a group. But a point against Spain is a massive boost ahead of their next game, coming against a Morocco side already with their backs to the wall."", 'Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2018: Portugal 3-3 Spain - watch all six goals in under a minute \n \n ""The night was about Cristiano. He is relentless in his pursuit of greatness. What he is doing on the world stage is ridiculous."" \n \n Match of the Day pundit Rio Ferdinand said he ""couldn\'t breathe"" as former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick, including an 88th-minute equaliser, as Portugal drew 3-3 with Spain in a classic World Cup encounter. \n \n Ronaldo, as he so often does, had the last word in a match full of drama, as Spain came within minutes of securing a happy ending to a turbulent week in which they sacked their manager a day before the start of the tournament. \n \n So just how good was this Ronaldo display? Well, his was the star turn in a match that is sure to be remembered for years to come. \n \n ""I\'m going to get a flight back tomorrow because I won\'t see a better game,"" joked former England winger Chris Waddle. \n \n What did Ronaldo do? \n \n It took just over three minutes for Portugal\'s captain to make his mark on the game in Sochi, drawing Nacho into a foul in the area and converting the penalty with trademark cool. \n \n Diego Costa equalised brilliantly but Ronaldo struck a second time, David de Gea\'s uncharacteristic fumble into the net a gift to the Real Madrid man. \n \n Costa scored again to make it 2-2 before Nacho made amends with a sublime strike to put Spain 3-2 up. \n \n But then came that free-kick... \n \n A one-in-45 shot \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device Ronaldo scores \'sensational\' free-kick to complete hat-trick \n \n Standing over the ball as De Gea set his wall and with just two minutes remaining, there was no doubt it would be Ronaldo who would take the set piece. And yet history suggested a team-mate - any team-mate - might have been better placed.. \n \n This, remarkably, was Ronaldo\'s first goal from a direct free-kick in 45 attempts at major championships. \n \n ""One or two will ask why I said at half-time Ronaldo needs to work on free-kicks. Well it\'s because it took him 45 attempts, but he did it,"" said former England captain Alan Shearer. \n \n ""It\'s a brilliant free-kick and it is technically so difficult to do,"" added former England midfielder Danny Murphy. ""He went over and around the wall and it had all sorts of bend and dip on it."" \n \n Speaking on Russia Today, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho offered a reminder that Ronaldo\'s free-kick record has worsened since his days at Old Trafford and early years at Real, but added that ""this one was the critical one"". \n \n ""There are players for some matches, there are players for every match and there are players for special matches. The players for special matches are the ones,"" the Portuguese added. \n \n Over to you, Lionel... \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup Catch-Up: Ronaldo the showman lights up biggest stage \n \n Lionel Messi is another of those ones. Ronaldo\'s pursuit of greatness has been inextricably linked with that of the Argentina forward, who starts his campaign against Iceland on Saturday. \n \n ""A little sub-plot to it is now the pressure is mounted on Messi\'s shoulders after watching Cristiano here,"" said Ferdinand. \n \n ""He\'ll deliver,"" came the reply from Cesc Fabregas on Match of the Day. Fabregas, of course, played with Messi at Barcelona between 2011 and 2014. \n \n Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin said Ronaldo would have ""hated"" the discussions before the tournament about whether this will be Messi\'s World Cup. \n \n ""Cristiano has raised the bar so Iceland could be in trouble,"" he added. \n \n Level with Puskas - greatness in numbers \n \n This was Ronaldo\'s 51st hat-trick for club and country, a ""personal best"" according to the man himself. \n \n It comprised his 82nd, 83rd and 84th international goals, putting him joint-second on the all-time list alongside Hungary legend Ferenc Puskas, now trailing only Iran\'s Ali Daei on 109. \n \n Will he surpass that mark? Or is it a case of when? \n \n Ronaldo also became the first man in history to score in eight consecutive major tournaments with his early penalty against Spain. Where will that streak end? \n \n ""Cristiano is the best in the world and I hope in Qatar once again he is going to score in a World Cup,"" said Portugal coach Fernando Santos, feeling his side\'s 33-year-old talisman can extend his international career until 2022. \n \n Despite the brilliance of his performance, Ronaldo was quick to try to make his team the focus at the full-time whistle. \n \n ""The most important thing is to highlight what the team has done,"" said Ronaldo. ""The game was about to end and we managed to equalise so we are happy. \n \n ""We are not the favourites so we will try to do our best. The team is doing very well and we are going to do well for sure."" \n \n Portugal\'s next Group B game is against Morocco on Wednesday at 13:00 BST, while Spain face Iran at 19:00, no doubt happy to see the back of Ronaldo, for now at least. \n \n ""When you are playing a player like Ronaldo these things can happen,"" said Spain coach Fernando Hierro. \n \n ""It is extremely fortunate for whichever team has him, but I certainly would not change him for any of the players in my squad."" \n \n Where does it rank? \n \n Ronaldo\'s hat-trick is likely to become one of the most memorable World Cup moments and this match one of the best in the competition\'s history. \n \n ""It was one of the best World Cup games I\'ve seen - especially in a group stage. It augurs well for the rest of the World Cup,"" said Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker. \n \n But where does Ronaldo\'s performance rank? Here are some of the best individual displays in World Cup history... \n \n Oleg Salenko - Russia 6-1 Cameroon (USA 1994) - Salenko remains the first and only player to score five goals in a single World Cup game. It was enough for him to earn a share of the Golden Boot, even though Russia went out in the first round. \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device Archive: Salenko bags five \n \n Sandor Kocsis - Hungary 8-3 West Germany (Switzerland 1954) - Kocsis followed a hat-trick against South Korea with four in Hungary\'s group-stage demolition of West Germany. The great Hungarian side seemed destined to be world champions, only to be stunned by the Germans in the final. \n \n Zinedine Zidane - France 3-0 Brazil (France 1998) - Zidane bossed the 1998 final, taking France to the world title on home soil. He scored twice and dismantled defending champions Brazil. \n \n Eusebio - Portugal 5-3 North Korea (England 1966) - North Korea were heading for perhaps the biggest shock of all time when they led Portugal 3-0. Enter Eusebio, who scored four unanswered goals, including two from the spot. \n \n Sir Geoff Hurst - England 4-2 West Germany (England 1966) - To this day still the only hat-trick in a World Cup final, one that carried England to the greatest day in their footballing history and earned Hurst a knighthood. \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device 50 Great World Cup moments: England win the World Cup - 1966 \n \n \'With the God Ronaldo, miracles are possible\' - how Portuguese and Spanish media reacted \n \n A young Portugal fan with a poster of his hero \n \n Correio da Manha (Portugal): ""It is not enough to call him king. This Ronaldo of Russia reaches the dimension of God. A giant among small creatures fearful of their gifts, powers and moods. This game with Spain puts Ronaldo on the highest altar of this global religion. Ronaldo achieved immortality."" \n \n Diario de Noticias (Portugal): Like Eusebio against North Korea in 1966, Pele against France in 1958 or Maradona against England in 1986, CR7\'s display against Spain in the 2018 World Cup will be for eternity."" \n \n Publico (Spain): ""Spain has talent but does not have the best in the world. Without a doubt, Spain is a better team than the Portuguese team collectively and individually. But there is no Cristiano Ronaldo. And that made all the difference in this match."" \n \n El Mundo (Spain): ""Spain survives Cristiano Ronaldo. When there is a huge player in front, the draw is not a bad solution.""', ""On Friday morning, meanwhile, only a few hours before the game, it emerged in Spanish news media reports that Ronaldo himself had agreed to pay the Spanish authorities $21.8 million in unpaid taxes. He has also been given a two-year suspended jail sentence, the papers said. It would be hard to believe that these developments did not faze him as the game approached. \n \n Still, it was Ronaldo who gave Portugal the lead, winning and converting a penalty after just four minutes of play. And it was Ronaldo who restored the lead, his shot squirming under David De Gea, the Spanish goalkeeper, as the first half drew to a close. And it was Ronaldo who, with just a few minutes remaining in the second half, lined up a free kick a little outside the Spanish penalty area with Portugal now trailing, 3-2. \n \n He had taken 44 free kicks in previous World Cups. He had scored on none of them. Still, you know what they say: the 45th time’s a charm. \n \n It is true that Ronaldo, at 33, is not the player he was. He is still perfectly sculpted, of course, a Men’s Health magazine cover made flesh, but the electric pace has fizzled a little; he does not cover quite as much ground (only one player, the Portuguese defender José Fonte, ran less than Ronaldo in a first half in which one of them scored twice). \n \n But it is equally true to say that Ronaldo, even in his twilight, shines brighter than almost any player with whom he comes into contact. He has not so much faded as a player as evolved into something different. It is misleading to suggest that he has transformed into a striker, a penalty- area predator, because he is not really restricted by such mortal concepts as geography. \n \n Instead, he has attained a level of such devastating efficiency that he now does not really require something so mundane as the ball. He does not need to be involved. He looks, often, like he is doing nothing, or something quite close to it — as if he is a mere passenger. It is an illusion. He is always in the cockpit. \n \n Isco, his Real Madrid teammate, was the dominant player on the field here, the one who was most involved, who prompted and probed and prodded, and he was wearing a Spain jersey. Ronaldo has moved beyond needing to dictate games. He concerns himself only with defining them. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n His free kick, needless to say, curled artfully, effortlessly, past De Gea and into the corner of Spain’s goal, as Ronaldo — despite all historical evidence to the contrary — must have known it would. \n \n Portugal, which is now best thought of as a nation established in 1128 so that it might one day produce Cristiano Ronaldo, would have its draw. More important, the 2018 World Cup had its spark. The afterglow of a game like this can last for a couple of weeks, at least; on this stage, it can resonate around the world. \n \n Spain would have been forgiven for feeling like a victim. It had been the better team in this game, had more of the ball, created more opportunities, played the slicker, smoother soccer. \n \n It had looked every inch a contender for a World Cup title and nothing like a side still reeling from Lopetegui’s departure, shaken to its core by a dispute between its players and their ultimate bosses at the country’s federation, having to adjust to life under a new coach who, until now, had only managed one second-division team. \n \n That Spain’s players did not let all this deter them on Friday only served to emphasize the scale of Ronaldo’s performance and the overall quality of the match. \n \n And when the final whistle blew, the stadium stood: not just the clusters of Portuguese fans, not just the neutrals and the Russians, but the Spanish fans, too, in those blood-red jerseys. They applauded their own team, of course; there was enough encouragement there to see the bigger picture, to believe that the tumult of the last few days may not be fatal to their hopes. \n \n But when Spain’s players had left the field, and Portugal’s stood in the center circle, the Spanish fans remained standing, and they kept clapping, as every single Portuguese player sought out Ronaldo, to clasp his hand, to ruffle his hair, as though just to touch him was to brush against something holy. \n \n They do not mind that he attracts — demands, really — all of the attention. They do not mind being in the supporting cast, just as those Spanish fans did not mind providing the audience for the three acts of his one-man show. Sometimes, it is a pleasure simply to be there; sometimes, it is a pleasure just to sit back and watch. And at the end, sometimes there is nothing to do but applaud. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n ■ Here’s how it happened: \n \n Full Time: Spain 3, Ronaldo 3 \n \n Ronaldo has produced one of the most remarkable individual performances you could possibly hope to see, and illuminated what will take some beating as the best game of the tournament. Portugal hasn’t been discussed much as a contender for the World Cup, despite being European champion. This may have been an oversight. \n \n 90 + 2’: Portugal Almost Pulls Away \n \n Quaresa almost wins it! He walks the ball through the Spanish defense, into the penalty area, around two defenders. But the third arrives in the nick of time to smother his shot. What a winner that might have been. I think we all — players, coaches, fans, viewers — need a whistle, a beer and a shower at this point. \n \n 88’: GOAL! Ronaldo Equalizes \n \n Oh woooooowwwwwwww! Ronaldo completes his hat trick with a stunning free kick, curled around the wall’s right edge. De Gea never had a chance. It’s 3-3. Message from the office in New York: “Can they just keep playing, please?” \n \n 86’: Sloppy Spain \n \n Now it’s Spain that gives away a silly free kick, as Piqué, who had Ronaldo corralled with his back to goal, shoves him down. \n \n 84’: A Clasico Moment \n \n A little Barcelona-Real Madrid spice as Ronaldo throws the ball to Jordi Alba, who was coming to take it for a throw-in. You can take the boys out of the Clasico, but you can’t take the Clasico out of the boys. \n \n 82’: Just When You Think Spain Is Sitting Back ... \n \n Isco adds some rare excitement at the other end, squeezing off a low shot that Rui Patricio handles with ease. \n \n 79’: Danger in the Area \n \n A long, bounding ball from Portugal’s end results in a collision of Ronaldo, De Gea and Piqué, who appears to take the brunt of a collision with a goalkeeper and a bronze statue in full sprint. The ball, most important if you’re Spanish, winds up cleared in the interaction, and a handball by Quaresma trying to collect it allows everyone to exhale. \n \n That ball seemed to catch everyone but Ronaldo by surprise, and he nearly made Spain pay for their momentary confusion. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n 76’: Spain Puts on the Clamps \n \n It’s easy to get lulled into this thriller, but Spain has quietly settled into two banks of four defensively. For a team that knows how to pick a lock on offense, they also know how to clamp down when it counts. \n \n 70’: Portugal Makes Changes \n \n Joao Mario and Ricardo Quaresma come on for Portugal, now seeking fresh legs and, most important, a goal with 20 minutes left. Spain brings on Bayern Munich’s Thiago Alcántara for Iniesta — young legs for aging ones. \n \n 64’: Spain-Portugal Delivers \n \n This would have been a super World Cup final: tense, dramatic, goal-filled. A terrific game. Though, to be fair, awarding the trophy tonight before 24 teams kicked a ball might cause problems at the next FIFA Congress. \n \n Photo \n \n 58’ GOAL! Nacho Gives Spain the Lead \n \n Nacho steps into a failed clearance, puts his laces into the ball and pings both posts with a shot through traffic. A rocket and, for the moment, a potential winner. \n \n 55’: GOAL! Diego Costa Makes Portugal Pay \n \n And that’s what happens when you give away free kicks easily. GOAL! Free kick is rolled into play, lofted to Busquets at the right post, and he nods it into the path of Costa. He’s got two now, just like Ronaldo, and we’ve got a game again. Spain: 2, Portugal: 2, All of us: happy. \n \n Rory Smith: Diego Costa has been Spain’s great conundrum in the last few years: he offers a threat the rest of the team simply doesn’t possess, but he’s always struggled to be himself in a context that is so alien, and a style so unfamiliar. If Fernando Hierro has solved that in two days, maybe he should have got the Real Madrid job. \n \n 53’: Spain’s Strategy ... \n \n Spain’s back to playing keepaway. Their possession can lull defenses to sleep and they know it. Enough of it, and an opponent without focus can be coaxed into bad positions, bad decisions, bad fouls out of frustration. That was one right there, and now, just like that, Spain has a dangerous free kick from 30 yards. \n \n 46’: More Entertainment on the Way? \n \n The teams are back and here we go. Let’s hope the second half is even half as good as that first 45 was. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Was just wondering how many goals Ronaldo would have by now if he’d been fined, say, $50 million this morning by the Spanish tax man. \n \n Photo \n \n Halftime: Two Ronaldo Goals Give Portugal the Lead \n \n Cristiano Ronaldo scores early — a fourth-minute penalty — and late — on a 44th-minute blunder by Spain’s goalkeeper — and Portugal leads the Iberian Derby in Sochi, 2-1 at the break. Spain was solid except for the two times it wasn’t, and Ronaldo — an assassin of a forward who seems to get better with age — was there each time to pounce. \n \n 44’: GOAL! Ronaldo Does it Again \n \n A howler from De Gea and Portugal leads 2-1. Ronaldo gets the ball near the top of the area, and wangles a hard low shot at De Gea. Eminently savable, he instead lets it skip off him and in. That’s a terrible mistake from an outstanding goalkeeper, and it’s cost his team badly here in the closing second of the half. \n \n Rory Smith: This will be no solace for David De Gea — who really does not make mistakes like that — but this is the game the World Cup needed. Spain has been breathtaking at times, but there’s a resilience to Portugal, a nous, that makes them a threat. And they have this guy upfront: tall, tan, who looks to have quite the career ahead of him. \n \n 42’: Pepe’s Not Really Sorry \n \n One of the eternal truths of world soccer is that when Pepe fouls a guy from behind and then helps him up and says “sorry,” he’s probably not. The same truism applies to Sergio Ramos and probably a dozen other players you can think of off the top of your head. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But he’s got the angle fractionally wrong, and while Rui Patricio dives to make it look good in the photos, the ball was always going wide. \n \n The contrast in attacking styles tonight is remarkable: Spain attacks like a molasses spill — slowly and steadily creeping forward, ever forward, inch by inch — applying more and more pressure, hoping something finally cracks, and they’re in. Portugal, on the other hand, waits and waits and then breaks out like a stolen Ferrari on the counterattack. \n \n Photo \n \n 30’: VAR Does its Job \n \n They finally show the replay of the Spanish shot off the bar, and it wasn’t close to crossing the line when it came down. Goal line technology, introduced at the World Cup in 2014, does its job. I’ve never seen it fall to be honest. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Fernando Hierro, by the way, is prowling the Spain coaching box in shirt sleeves like he wants to check in to the game. Gesturing, clapping, stalking. \n \n 29’: Silva Hits the Wall \n \n Silva stands over the free kick with Koke as the referee sets the wall. Silva right, Koke left. But the shot finds the wall like a magnet. \n \n 26’: Spain Almost Scores Again \n \n Was that in?? We’ll review. A Spanish shot rockets off the crossbar and down off the line — Georff Hurst-style — but a second look says no, it didn’t go in. And again play moves on. \n \n 24’: GOAL! Diego Costa Levels for Spain \n \n Diego Costa gets behind the defense and dances around two defenders until he can get a look at the goal. Spotting it, he buries a shot past Rui Patricio. \n \n Rory Smith: Spain’s reputation for delicacy is well-earned, but occasionally a little bit of brute force is required: Diego Costa bulldozes (just about fairly) through Pepe, twists and turns until he sees a glimmer of goal, and then arrows a shot past Rui Patricio. This is better than Iran against Morocco. \n \n 21’: Spain Threatens, but Misses \n \n We’re spending a bit more time in Portugal’s end here as Spain probes the Portuguese defense at its leisure. Now Iniesta spots a crease and dashes into on the left. He takes the ball to the end line and cuts it back for Silva, but his shot goes wide. \n \n 17’: Free Kick for Ronaldo \n \n Sergio Busquets loses a ball on the left side and, compounding his mistake, picks up a yellow. Ronaldo stands over the free kick. \n \n Ronaldo slams it into the wall, half of Portugal’s team calls for a handball, but the referee, Italy’s Gianluca Rocchi, isn’t having it. He points the other way, and Spain is playing keepaway again. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n 16’: Spain Tries to Find Comfort Zone \n \n A little more possession for Spain here, which is their comfort zone. Quick one touch stuff: here you have it, oh no you take it back, no you, really, no you, OK, I’ll look over here, oh never mind here’s the ball back. But it might settle them a bit. \n \n 14’: Ronaldo in Charge \n \n The crowd roars audibly literally every time Ronaldo touches the ball. He’s the star here, a spotlight that as we all know he doesn’t like. (I’m totally kidding; he looooooooves it.) \n \n 11’: Clock Games \n \n Ruo Patricio almost seems like he’s time-wasting after collecting a deep ball, picking it up, dropping it, picking it up again. Which would be the funniest thing ever considering it’s THE ELEVENTH MINUTE. \n \n Spain is wearing white today, btw, and Portugal is in Spain’s traditional red shirts. It’s a little disconcerting. \n \n 10’: Spain Tries to Recover \n \n The ball falls to David Silva after a hopeful cross into the penalty area, and he slashes at it with his right foot and skies it over the bar. \n \n The look on his face after that miss surely matches all of Spain’s, a nation trying to figure out how such a hopeful summer could go so wrong so far. \n \n 3’: Goal! Ronaldo Makes Spain Pay \n \n Well, we said there would be drama, and that’s it from the start. A foul, a whistle and a penalty for Ronaldo! He converts, and just like that Spain’s World Cup somehow manages to get even worse. \n \n Photo \n \n Rory Smith: Four minutes in, Portugal leads, through what looked, at first glance, like something of a soft penalty. Cristiano Ronaldo’s dancing feet enticed Nacho — his Real Madrid teammate — into what was definitely a foolish tackle; the forward threw himself to the floor after what was probably fairly minimal contact, and then dusted himself down to convert the spot-kick. His celebration — stroking his chin — may have been a G.O.A.T. reference. More on that as we get it. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The First Heavyweight Match of the World Cup \n \n There’s a buoyant atmosphere in Sochi ahead of the first really heavyweight meeting of the 2018 World Cup — an Iberian derby between Spain and Portugal. It’s been easy to miss the European fans in Russia so far — the Latin American contingents are more numerous and, if we’re honest, louder — but there are plenty from both countries in the baking heat of Sochi, on the lip of the Black Sea. The stadium is pretty much full, too, which is kind of a relief, after both of today’s other games were pockmarked by empty seats. — Rory Smith \n \n Spain’s New Coach Deals With Drama \n \n Spain’s new coach, Fernando Hierro, has stepped into a bit of a mess before this game, but he told reporters this week that Spain had no time to dwell on it. \n \n “We’ve come to fight for the World Cup,” he said. “We have a great opportunity and that should be the focus.” \n \n Hierro understands the stage; he made four World Cup teams and played in three for Spain. He said this week that he took over the team in its time of crisis out of a sense of duty. “When the president told me the possibility, I had three choices: to say no, another was to go and the third was to stay, to take a step forward for the Spanish federation and for Spanish soccer,” he said. “I couldn’t say no because I would not forgive myself.” \n \n Spain vs. Portugal Starting Lineups \n \n The lineups are out in Sochi, and both include household names: \n \n For Spain: De Gea; Nacho, Piqué, Ramos, Alba; Busquets, Koke, Iniesta; Isco, Silva; Diego Costa. \n \n One player who may have been lost in all the drama is Spain goalkeeper David De Gea. He’s among the best in the world at his position, and he just signed a new five-year deal to stay at Manchester United. So that should clear his head just in time to face Ronaldo. \n \n For Portugal: Patricio, Soares, Fonte, Pepe, Guerreiro, B Silva, Carvalho, Moutinho, Fernandes, Guedes, Ronaldo \n \n They’ll have a lot to live up to: the day’s first two games both ended with dramatic late winners. The soccer, however, should be a bit smoother from these two. For the sake of everyone, let’s hope it’s Ronaldo and Iniesta and David Silva and Bernardo Silva we’re talking about later, and not something Pepe or Sergio Ramos has done."", 'Image copyright Samsung Image caption Samsung acknowledges that it uses software that has an impact on its energy efficiency scores \n \n The European Commission says it is ""following up"" two reports that raise concerns that software used in TVs may be skewing their energy rating scores. \n \n One study indicates that some Samsung TVs nearly halve their power consumption when a standardised test is carried out. \n \n Another accuses a different unnamed manufacturer of adjusting the brightness of its sets when they ""recognise"" the test film involved. \n \n Samsung has denied any wrongdoing. \n \n It acknowledged that it used software that altered its televisions\' performance during tests, but said this was the effect of a general energy efficiency feature that came into effect during normal use and had nothing to do with the testing process. \n \n However, one environmental campaign group has likened the accusations to the Volkswagen diesel scandal, in which the German car firm admitted to programming its cars to deliberately cheat emissions tests. \n \n Power drop \n \n Televisions\' energy efficiency ratings are based on the power they use while screening a 10-minute video, which contains a mix of fast and slow-moving content shown at different brightness levels. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Manufacturers must carry out a standardised energy efficiency test before they can put their screens on sale \n \n Manufacturers run the test themselves and then file the results.

News of the study was first reported by the Guardian newspaper. \n \n ComplianTV\'s researchers found that the power demands of one of the South Korean firm\'s LCD TVs dropped from 70 watts to about 39 watts within a minute of the test video starting. \n \n ""That\'s not normal, it\'s an anomaly,"" explained Richard Kay, an EST spokesman. \n \n But he added: ""We don\'t have any evidence to back up the accusation that Samsung has a technology to recognise when it is tested."" \n \n Image copyright ComplianTV Image caption This graph shows how the Samsung TV reduced its power requirement shortly after the start of the test \n \n Samsung said it ""firmly rejected"" suggestions that it had designed its TV settings to deliberately produce misleading power performance results. \n \n But it acknowledged that ""motion lighting"" - a feature introduced in 2011 that controls TV screens\' backlights - was causing the discrepancy. \n \n ""It is a standard out-of-the-box feature, which is switched on when the customer takes delivery of their TV, and remains on whenever the customer chooses to watch their TV in standard viewing mode,"" it said in a blog. \n \n ""It is a default setting which works both in the lab and at home; delivering energy savings and helping us to reduce our environmental impact."" \n \n Dimmer picture \n \n The second study was carried out by the Swedish Energy Agency, which wrote to the European Commission to alert it of its findings in January. \n \n The agency has not disclosed which company\'s televisions it tested. \n \n But the BBC understands that sets belonging to a single manufacturer that was not Samsung were judged to ""clearly recognise"" the test film. \n \n ""These displays immediately lower their energy use by adjusting the brightness of the display when the standard film is being run,"" the report concluded. \n \n ""This is a way of avoiding the market surveillance authorities and should be addressed by the Commission."" \n \n \'Brave new world\' \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A UK watchdog raised concerns about TVs changing their power requirements during tests four years ago \n \n The European Commission said it now planned to explore the two sets of findings. \n \n ""We will follow up both of them,"" Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, spokeswoman for climate action and energy, told the BBC. \n \n ""We will first of all verify if the problem has occurred.

241,"['Last Updated, Wednesday, 11:07 a.m. The year before his seventh and final Tour de France victory, Lance Armstrong offered to donate “in excess of $150,000″ to the antidoping agency in charge of keeping American athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs, according to the organization’s chief executive. \n \n The latest accusation against Armstrong, the disgraced former cyclist, was made by the current head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, in an interview with CBS News posted online on Tuesday. In October, Usada stripped Armstrong of all of his titles and barred him from competition for life following the release of a 202-page report into what the agency called “the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.” \n \n As my colleague Juliet Macur reported, Armstrong, who has so far denied all allegations of cheating, “has told associates and antidoping officials that he is considering publicly admitting that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions during his cycling career.” Late Tuesday, Oprah Winfrey announced that she “will speak exclusively with Lance Armstrong in his first no-holds-barred interview,” to be broadcast next week on her network. \n \n BREAKING NEWS: Looking forward to this conversation with @lancearmstrong: http://t.co/GwSmBhdW #NextChapter — Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) 9 Jan 13 \n \n As the cycling journalist Lionel Birnie notes, the Oprah Winfrey Network is a joint venture with Discovery Communications, the broadcaster that sponsored Armstrong’s team in 2005. \n \n Lance is going on Oprah, partly-produced by Discovery Channel, sponsors of Lance’s 7th and final fraudulent Tour win. Somehow fitting. — Lionel Birnie (@lioneljbirnie) 9 Jan 13 \n \n Samantha Lane, a reporter for The Age in Australia, pointed out on Twitter that Winfrey and Armstrong looked comfortable together in a photograph published in the May 2004 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine with an interview of the cyclist before that year’s Tour de France. \n \n Oprah & Lance, in happier times (pic from her website). http://t.co/TMpMfYfk — Sam Lane (@SamJaneLane) 9 Jan 13 \n \n The photograph showed Armstrong in his Discovery Channel uniform and Winfrey, leaning on his shoulder, wearing a yellow, Livestrong bracelet. \n \n The network’s logo was emblazoned across the victor’s yellow jersey Armstrong wore on the top step of the podium in Paris that year, as he lectured “the people that don’t believe in cycling, the cynics and the skeptics.” \n \n Directly addressing those who accused him of doping that day, Armstrong said, “I’m sorry for you, I’m sorry you can’t dream big and I’m sorry you don’t believe in miracles, but this is one hell of a race, this is a great sporting event and you should stand around and believe. You should believe in these athletes and you should believe in these people. I’m a fan of the Tour de France for as long as I live and there’s no secrets — this is a hard sporting event and hard work wins it.” \n \n The notion of Armstrong confessing on Oprah was pre-mocked nearly two years ago by the bike racers and cartoonists Andy Shen and Dan Schmalz in their cult comic strip about the soap-operatic world of professional cycling, “As the Toto Turns,” for nyvelocity.com. \n \n Andy Shen and Dan Schmalz, nyvelocity.com \n \n Another journalist who writes about cycling, Shane Stokes, suggested that Armstrong might expect Winfrey to go easy on him, since she let another disgraced athlete, Marion Jones, claim during a 2008 interview that she had used performance-enhancing drugs unintentionally. \n \n Just after news of the interview broke, Kathy LeMond, whose husband, Greg, is now the only American to win the Tour de France, offered to put Winfrey in touch with people who could give her a crash course on the culture of professional cycling. \n \n .@Oprah I hope you get educated before the interview.

He then revealed that someone representing Armstrong had offered to give the American antidoping agency more than $150,000 at some point in 2004. “It was a clear conflict of interest for Usada,” Tygart said. “We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.” Pressed further about the amount of the proposed donation, Tygart said that it was about $250,000. \n \n In another portion of the interview, broadcast on the CBS Evening News on Tuesday, Tygart said that Armstrong had tried to intimidate former teammates who had testified to a federal grand jury about his doping. The official also revealed that he personally had received death threats as a result of his investigation into the cancer survivor who was once a hero to millions.', 'Story highlights Lance Armstrong has agreed to 90-minute interview, Oprah Winfrey\'s network announces \n \n Release says Armstrong is expected to talk about doping allegations \n \n Armstrong has been working out in Hawaii, doing triathlon training \n \n Lance Armstrong will give his first television interview since being stripped of his Tour de France titles to Oprah Winfrey, her network announced Tuesday. \n \n A news release from the Oprah Winfrey Network said the 90-minute ""no-holds-barred"" interview will air at 9 p.m. ET January 17 and will be simulcast on Oprah.com. \n \n Winfrey will ask the disgraced cycling star to address the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency\'s report, which said there was overwhelming evidence he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program, the statement said. \n \n The International Cycling Union, which choose not to appeal the USADA\'s lifetime ban, stripped Armstrong of his record seven Tour victories in October. \n \n The World Anti-Doping Agency also agreed with the sanctions, which means Armstrong may not compete in sports governed by WADA code. \n \n JUST WATCHED What\'s the truth with Lance Armstrong?

The Winfrey interview will take place at Armstrong\'s home in Austin, Texas. \n \n The New York Times reported last week that Armstrong, 41, was contemplating publicly admitting he used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Such an admission might lead toward Armstrong regaining his eligibility. \n \n Attorney Tim Herman, in a recent e-mail to CNN Sports, did not address whether Armstrong told associates -- as reported by the newspaper -- that he was considering an admission. \n \n Armstrong has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career. \n \n In the past, Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report that detailed Armstrong\'s alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. \n \n The agency did not say that Armstrong ever failed a test, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the tests altogether. \n \n The New York Times, citing unnamed associates and anti-doping officials, said Armstrong has been in discussions with USADA officials and hopes to meet with David Howman, chief of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The newspaper said none of the people with knowledge of Armstrong\'s situation wanted to be identified because it would jeopardize their access to information on the matter. \n \n Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, an athlete who confesses to using performance-enhancing drugs may be eligible for a reinstatement. \n \n Armstrong has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States. \n \n He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow ""LiveSTRONG"" wristbands that helped bring in the money. \n \n But Armstrong has long been dogged by doping allegations, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test -- making a series of claims in 2011. \n \n Armstrong sued the USADA last year to stop its investigation of him, arguing it did not have the right to prosecute him. But after a federal judge dismissed the case, Armstrong said he would no longer participate in the investigation. \n \n In October 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his titles and banned from cycling. Weeks later, he stepped down from the board of his foundation, Livestrong. \n \n It is unclear whether Armstrong would face criminal prosecution for perjury should he confess. Armstrong was involved in several cases where he gave sworn testimony that he never used banned drugs.']",2,"– Lance Armstrong is rumored to be ready to confess to drug use—and it could happen on Oprah's show.

243,"['Getting to know someone usually requires at least a little conversation. But a new study suggests you can get a hint of an individual\'s personality through his or her scent alone. \n \n Participants in the study assessed, with some degree of accuracy, how outgoing, anxious or dominant people were after only taking a whiff of their clothes. The study is the first to test whether personality traits can be discerned through body odor. \n \n While the match-up between responses by the judges and the judged were not perfect, they do suggest that, when forming a first impression, we take into account a person\'s smell, as well as visual and audible cues to their personality traits, the researchers said. \n \n We not only express ourselves through our looks, ""we also express ourselves with how we smell,"" said study researcher Agnieszka Sorokowska, a doctoral candidate at the University of Wroclaw, in Poland. \n \n The study will be published in an upcoming issue of the European Journal of Personality. \n \n Personality smells \n \n Sorokowska and colleagues asked 30 men and 30 women to don white cotton t-shirts for three consecutive nights. Participants could not use fragrances, deodorants or soaps, and could not smoke or drink or eat odorous foods during the study. Participants also took a personality test. \n \n Shirts from the ""odor donors"" were collected and rated by 100 men and 100 women. Raters were asked to smell the shirts (placed in non-transparent plastic bags) and evaluate five personality traits of the donors, on a scale of one to 10. Each rater assessed six shirts, and each shirt was assessed by 20 raters. \n \n The judges\' ratings matched up with the self-assessments of the donors for three personality traits: extroversion (the tendency to be outgoing and sociable) neuroticism (the tendency to feel anxious and moody) and dominance (the urge to be a leader). \n \n The matches were far from perfect. But the raters predicted the donor\'s level of extroversion and neuroticism through smell about as accurately as participants in a different study predicted personality traits based on a video depicting a person\'s behavior, Sorokowska said. \n \n Judgments of dominance were most accurate in the case where an individual rater was assessing the odor of someone who was the opposite sex, suggesting such judgments are especially important when it comes to choosing a mate, the researchers said. \n \n Odor and emotions \n \n Extroversion, neuroticism and dominance are all traits that may, to some extent, be expressed physiologically, including through our emotions. \n \n For instance, people who are neurotic may sweat more when they experience stress, which would modify the bacteria in their underarms and make them smell different, the researchers said. \n \n Personality traits may also be linked with the secretion of hormones that could alter a persons\' scent. People who are high in dominance may have higher levels of testosterone, which in turn may modify their sweat glands, the researchers said. \n \n The findings are preliminary and more studies need to be done to confirm the results, Sorokowska said. It\'s not clear whether the same link would be found in other cultures known to have weaker body odors, Sorokowska said. \n \n Pass it on: Some traits of an individual\'s personality can be assessed through smell, preliminary research suggests. \n \n Follow MyHealthNewsDaily staff writer Rachael Rettner on Twitter @RachaelRettner.

The girl was on a 6-inch ledge ready to jump. \n \n One misstep, and she could fall some 80 feet to her death, so Perez did not rush up to her. \n \n ""I walked up to her calmly. I literally didn\'t even start talking to her until I made it to the sidewalk and just asked her what was happening, what was going on,"" Perez told CBS News correspondent Carter Evans. \n \n The whole time, he knew if he said the wrong thing, she might just let go. \n \n ""She told me she was upset by a group home that she was living at, and that\'s why she ran away. She was telling me they treated her poorly and badly and would lock her in a room every time she was bad,"" Perez said. \n \n It took time, patience and trust. \n \n ""It was just back-and-forth banter with me and her. \'Can I come closer to you? Can I talk you closer? Can I pull you over the ledge so we can talk in a safer environment?\'"" Perez said. ""It was that back-to-back conversation with her that I felt was going so smoothly that I felt comfortable enough to lean over and get her."" \n \n The girl did allow him to rescue her. \n \n ""I grabbed a hold of her arm, and I wrapped it around my neck and grabbed her body and bear hugged her and dragged her over,"" Perez said. \n \n ""2-0-2. It\'s code four. I got her off the bridge,"" Perez could be heard saying afterwards over the police radio. \n \n Perez said the girl didn\'t seem happy after the rescue. \n \n ""She was sad and just started breaking down even more,"" he said. \n \n By the time paramedics arrived, Perez\'s job was done -- but not forgotten. Now when he looks at the bridge, fear goes through his mind, he said. \n \n She had told him she only had an aunt -- no other family -- and wanted to live with her. For now, the 12-year-old is waiting in protective police custody.', 'SOUTH PASADENA (CBSLA.com) — A hug saved a 12-year-old girl who had fled from a Los Angeles group home with the intention of jumping to her death. \n \n Officer Chris Perez was on patrol in the area of York Bridge and San Pascual Avenue at about 6:50 p.m. Tuesday when he was flagged down by bystanders who said a girl was sitting on the other side of the bridge’s guardrail, threatening to jump. \n \n The child – whom police described as sobbing and desperate – was hanging by one hand from the bridge, which was about 80 feet over asphalt. \n \n Perez walked to the area where the 12-year-old girl was dangling and spoke to her, learning she was from a group home in Los Angeles that she fled for severe emotional reasons, South Pasadena police officials said. The rookie officer, who had only been with the department for a year, asked if he could come closer to speak to her more personally, and she said he could. \n \n The officer quickly developed a rapport with the girl and was able to calm her down, according to police. The girl agreed to allow Perez to come closer, and he asked if he could help her back over the bridge railing. \n \n “She was just crying and holding on,” he said. \n \n The girl told Perez she was scared and needed help, so the officer leaned over the railing, grabbed her in a bear hug and helped her over the railing to safety, police said. \n \n Perez sat with the child on the sidewalk and gave her water, police said. When she complained of an ankle injury, Perez called the fire department for assistance. \n \n The girl, who had been living in a group home at an address off of Avenue 64 in Los Angeles, was taken into custody for medical evaluation, according to police. \n \n She “is safe tonight because of Officer Perez’s calm, professional actions,” police officials said. \n \n CBS2’s Kristine Lazar said this was an example of being in the right place at the right time. \n \n Her interview with Officer Perez is a story that is Only On 2. \n \n He told her he was only an hour into his shift when he was told about the young girl on the bridge. \n \n She told him she wanted to be reunited with her only family — an aunt. \n \n “I do have nephews, and nieces,” Perez said, “one who is 7, the other who just turned 2. So I can’t relate, that, oh my Lord, this young indivual, this juvenile, is on the other side [on the bridge] what could possibly be going wrong in your life to make you want to do something like this?” \n \n Perez is reluctant to call himself a hero and uncomfortable that others are calling him one — but he is glad his parents (and dad is also an officer) took notice. \n \n “Hearing it from my parents is one thing,” Perez says, humbly, “Because I know I did right by them.”']",2,"– Faced with a 12-year-old girl hanging by an arm from an 80-foot-high bridge, threatening to end her young life, a rookie cop started talking, reports CBS Los Angeles. Asking the girl if he could come closer, Officer Chris Perez says the child ""was just crying and holding on;"" she told Perez she had fled a group home in LA, and that she needed help. ""It was just back-and-forth banter with me and her,"" Perez says. ""'Can I come closer to you? Can I talk you closer? Can I pull you over the ledge so we can talk in a safer environment?' It was that back-to-back conversation with her that I felt was going so smoothly that I felt comfortable enough to lean over and get her."" Per CBS, Perez ""leaned over the railing, grabbed her in a bear hug, and helped her over the railing to safety."" Police officials credit Perez's ""calm, professional actions"" with saving the girl, while Perez himself seems appalled that someone so young could find herself so desperate. ""I can’t relate, that, oh my Lord, this young individual, this juvenile, is on the other side [on the bridge] what could possibly be going wrong in your life to make you want to do something like this?"" But after the rescue, ""she was sad and just started breaking down even more,"" Perez tells CBS News. The girl, who wanted to reconnect with an aunt, her only family, was put in police custody."

246,"['The group of teenagers who filmed and mocked a man as he was drowning in a Cocoa pond will face charges after all, police said Friday. \n \n Jamel Dunn drowned in a Cocoa pond July 7 \n \n 5 teens laughed while filming drowning, police say \n \n Cocoa Police turned to state death-reporting statute for charges \n \n \n \n RELATED: Man\'s body found at edge of Cocoa pond identified \n \n \n \n SEE BELOW: Video of the drowning ▼ \n \n In a news conference, Cocoa Police Chief Michael Cantaloupe did not describe the charges that will be filed against the five teenagers who recorded and mocked 31-year-old Jamel Dunn as he drowned July 7. But he said that after looking long and hard at Florida law, the teens would face charges for not reporting a death. \n \n He said that there\'s no law requiring to report to officials that someone is dying. But after someone has died, people are required to contact authorities. \n \n A day after police said that no charges would be filed despite the immorality of the teens\' actions, Cantaloupe said his detectives and prosecutors from the State Attorney\'s Office spoke for hours on Friday, trying to find a way to press charges. Police are now in the midst of paperwork to the office, he said. \n \n &amp;amp;amp;nbsp; \n \n The statute they will use, Florida Statute 406.12, is typically reserved for medical examiners when it comes to reported deaths. It reads: ""It is the duty of any person in the district where a death occurs, who becomes aware of the death of any person occurring... must report such death and circumstances to the district medical examiner."" \n \n The charge is a misdemeanor. \n \n ""It will be kind of a test case,"" Cantaloupe said. ""... As far as we know, the statute has never been used in this way."" \n \n Cantaloupe said there should be a law that would make it illegal to not report someone who is dying and in need of aid. \n \n ""We don\'t want another family have to go through what the Dunn family has went through,"" he said. Building better laws, working with juveniles and establishing better family relationships may prevent another situation, he added. \n \n Cantaloupe said it\'s possible Dunn would be alive today if one of the teens had called for help. \n \n Cantaloupe said he\'s not giving out the names of the teenagers because it\'s an ongoing investigation. But he said their ages are between 14 to 16 years old. \n \n BREAKING: @cocoapolice file charges against teens in case of man who drowned in pond.

We can find no moral justification for either the behavior of persons heard on the recording of the deliberate decision not to render aid to Mr. Dunn,"" it stated. \n \n ""This is an isolated act of unspeakable inhumanity and in no way is a reflection of our community,"" Cocoa Mayor Henry Parrish III said in a statement. \n \n \n \n Dunn was determined to have entered the water on his own after video from a neighbor’s security camera showed him scaling a fence and intentionally going into the pond. \n \n \'Rendering aid\' is not a requirement in many states \n \n When it comes to people in distress, many states do not require that someone render aid or even call authorities. \n \n Some states do require assistance in car crashes, or if you\'re the person who put the other person in danger in the first place. \n \n Another is on the water: Federal law requires a mariner under U.S. jurisdiction to help anyone ""found at sea in danger of being lost."" \n \n Also, all states have good Samaritan laws that protect people from being sued for anything that happened while trying to help someone in danger. \n \n Many countries do have laws requiring assistance, even if you only call authorities. They include Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy and Russia. \n \n Information from the Associated Press was used in this story. \n \n WARNING: Some may find this video disturbing. News 13 has removed the audio of the video in respect to Jamel Dunn\'s family.', 'Police in Florida are pursuing misdemeanor charges against five teenagers for failure to report a death after authorities say they recorded video of a man’s drowning and didn\'t intervene. \n \n The video, taken earlier this month in Cocoa, Florida, about 45 miles east of Orlando, shows a person\'s head bobbing up and down in a pond. The teenagers, who are between the ages of 14 and 18 and have not been named by police, are heard laughing and joking in the video, with one of them appearing to laugh and say, ""He just died!"" \n \n Cocoa Police Chief Mike Cantaloupe said the department learned of the recording last weekend and later reviewed it. Police identified and interviewed the five teens, he said. \n \n Police in conjunction with the State Attorney’s Office determined that charges of ""failure to report a death under Florida Statute 406.12,"" a misdemeanor, will be pursued, the Cocoa police said in a statement today. Police said the charging document, case report and video evidence are being sent to the State Attorney’s Office for review, and a decision about whether the charges will be prosecuted. \n \n “When we initially reviewed this case it was determined there were no laws broken as the teens were not directly involved with the death,” Cantaloupe said in a statement today. ""Further research of the statutes and consultation with the State Attorney’s Office yielded the decision to move forward with charges under this statute. It’s our belief that this law has never been enforced in a scenario like this, but we feel it could be applicable.” \n \n Cantaloupe added, “Pursuing criminal charges is a way to hold them accountable for their own actions.” \n \n Earlier, Cocoa police said that the five teenagers were not facing criminal charges after the State Attorney’s Office was consulted. \n \n “As horrible as this video is the laws in the State of Florida do not obligate citizens to render aid or call someone to render aid to a person in distress,"" Cantaloupe said on Thursday. \n \n The victim, 31-year-old Jamel Dunn of Cocoa, drowned July 9, police said. He was reported missing July 12 and authorities recovered his body July 14 after a passerby reported a body floating in the pond. \n \n Police said home surveillance video apparently captured Dunn jumping over a fence and willingly going into the water. ""I don\'t think you can ever replace a lost life,"" Cantaloupe told ABC News today. \n \n He added, ""I think what we look at is, the hope that what we do from here going forward, whether it be this charge or some new legislation, that another family doesn’t have to go through this. And that we work with our youth ... to instill these morals ... I would’ve never believed that somebody could watch somebody in distress and not do anything about it."" \n \n Of the video recorded by the teenagers, Cantaloupe said in a statement Thursday, ""There are no words to describe how utterly inhumane and cruel the actions of these juveniles were towards Mr. Dunn. ... I want to express my deepest condolences to Mr. Dunn’s family and friends."" \n \n Cocoa Mayor Henry Parrish III released a statement today regarding the incident. ""It saddens me to the core to watch video shot by a group of kids watching a man drown and doing nothing to help him. There just are no words to describe the lack of conscience within these young people,"" he said. \n \n ""I also would like to extend my deepest condolences to Mr. Dunn’s family and friends,"" he added. ""My hope is we all come together to make sure this doesn’t happen to anyone else."" \n \n Parrish said of the decision to pursue charges, ""While this in no way will bring justice for what occurred, it is a start."" \n \n ""In a case like this we struggle to understand how anyone could be so cold and heartless and then learn that there are no laws in Florida that obligate someone to render aid or call for someone to render aid for a person they see in distress,"" he said. ""If this case can be used as an example to draft new legislation, then I am committed to move forward to make that happen. More so, may this tragic incident, which has shocked all of us, cause each of us to examine ourselves and our responsibility to one another."" \n \n ""I implore the State Attorney’s Office to follow through and file the charges presented by the Cocoa Police Department!"" he added. \n \n ABC News\' Benjamin Stein contributed to this report.']",2,"– Despite reports Thursday that they wouldn't be charged with a crime, the five teens who allegedly laughed and filmed a man as he drowned in Florida earlier this month could now face misdemeanor charges. ABC News reports police have recommended charges for ""duty to report"" against the unnamed teens, who range in age from 14 to 16. News 13 explains that while Florida doesn't have a law requiring bystanders to report someone dying, it does have a law that requires people to report someone has died. Jamel Dunn, 31, drowned earlier this month. Cocoa Police Chief Mike Cantaloupe says it's the first time the law would be used in this manner, and the teens would serve as a ""test case."" News 13 reports the statute is most typically applied to medical examiners. The State Attorney's Office worked with police to come up with the charges, but the office will determine whether to prosecute the case.

247,"['Wolff on Media \n \n At home in Beverly Hills, the candidate talks Murdoch, what he\'s reading, how he\'ll redo electoral math and Ari Emanuel\'s offer to script his convention. \n \n The long day is ending for Donald Trump with a pint of vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice cream. We\'re settling in for a late-night chat at his Beverly Hills house, a 5,395-square-foot Colonial mansion directly across from the Beverly Hills Hotel. He\'s here for the final presidential primary, a California coronation of sorts, after rallies in Orange County (where violence broke out and seven people were arrested). He is, as he has been for much of our conversation — and perhaps much of the last year — marveling at his own campaign. ""You looked outside before, you see what\'s going on,"" he boasts about the police surrounding his house, and the Secret Service detail cramming his garage and snaking around the pool at the center of the front drive. And he\'s just returned from a big donor fundraiser in Brentwood for the Republican Party at the home of Tom Barrack, the investor and former Miramax co-owner. ""There had to be over a thousand policeman. They had a neighborhood roped off, four or five blocks away from this beautiful house. Machine guns all over the place."" \n \n One thing to understand about Trump is that, rather unexpectedly, he\'s neither angry nor combative. He may be the most threatening and frightening and menacing presidential candidate in modern life, and yet, in person he\'s almost soothing. His extreme self-satisfaction rubs off. He\'s a New Yorker who actually might be more at home in California (in fact, he says he usually comes to his home here — two buildings on Rodeo Drive — only once a year). Life is sunny. Trump is an optimist — at least about himself. He\'s in easy and relaxed form campaigning here in these final days before the June 7 California primary, even with Hillary Clinton\'s biggest backers and a city that is about half Latino surrounding him. \n \n Earlier in the day, I\'d met with Trump at a taping of ABC\'s Jimmy Kimmel Live! at the El Capitan Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, where he was the single guest for the evening (musicians The Weeknd and Belly canceled upon learning of his appearance). ""Have you ever seen anything like this?"" he asked. He meant this, the Trump phenomenon. Circumventing any chance that I might dampen the sentiment, he quickly answered his own question: ""No one ever has."" \n \n His son-in-law, New York Observer owner Jared Kushner, married to his daughter Ivanka and also a real estate scion — but clearly a more modest and tempered fellow, a wisp next to his beefsteak father-in-law — offered that they may have reached 100 percent name recognition. In other words, Trump could be the most famous man in the world right now. ""I may be,"" says Trump, almost philosophically, and referencing the many people who have told him they\'ve never seen anything like this. ""Bill O\'Reilly said in his lifetime this is the greatest phenomenon he\'s ever seen."" \n \n That notion is what\'s at the center of this improbable campaign, its own brilliant success. It\'s its main subject — the one you can\'t argue with. You can argue about issues, but you can\'t argue with success. Hence, to Trump, you\'re really foolish to argue with the Trump campaign. ""I\'ve spent $50 million of my own money to go through the primaries. Other people spent $230 million and they came in last. You know what I\'m saying?"" And this provides him the reason to talk endlessly and repetitively about the phenomenon of the campaign. That phenomenon is, of course, Trump himself, about whom Trump spends a lot of time talking in the third person. \n \n You can try, but it\'s hard to resist this admiration for himself. The certainty of it, the enthusiasm for it and the lack of not just doubt, but of any negativity. It\'s all upbeat and positive. The dark, scary, virulent heart of American politics is having the best time anyone has ever had. \n \n Trump at a May 25 rally in Anaheim. Violent clashes between protesters and police followed him through California. \n \n If onstage he calls people names, more privately he has only good, embracing things to say about almost everybody. (For most public people I know, it is the opposite.) He loves everybody. Genuinely seems to love everybody — at least everybody who\'s rich and successful (he doesn\'t really talk about anyone who isn\'t). Expressing love for everybody, for most of us, would clearly seem to be an act. But with Trump, it\'s the name-calling and bluster that might be the act. \n \n I offer that there are quite a number of people in New York, some we know in common, who are puzzled that the generous, eager-to-be-liked and liking-everyone-in-return Donald has morphed into a snarling and reactionary public enemy, at least a liberal enemy. This, I suggest, might be a source of the continuing dialectic — or to some, wishful thinking — that he does not necessarily believe what he says. \n \n I might detect the most mild sort of annoyance here. Trump says it\'s that he just never talked about his beliefs in the past — after all, he wasn\'t a politician. ""Who thought this was going to happen?"" But his larger point seems to be that such a topic — what he says — is a silly thing to focus on. The point is not about politics, or policies, but about how people, about how many people, have responded to him. It\'s too big to ignore the bigness. ""You heard Jimmy announce tonight that I have the most votes in the history of the Republican Party,"" he says by way of explanation for the larger issues at hand — i.e., him. \n \n In a way, what this evening\'s Kimmel show was about was treating Trump\'s positions as though they are, well, Trump\'s positions, qualitatively different than other politicians\' positions. In fact, you might logically see the Kimmel show as a devastating attack on Trump\'s views and claims. Kimmel flat out doesn\'t believe him. That recording of the PR person alleged to be Trump sounding like a PR person? Trump: ""It didn\'t sound like me."" Kimmel: ""No. Sounded like you."" (An exchange repeated similarly several times, with no rancor from either Trump or Kimmel.) ""And oh,"" says Kimmel, ""remember when you liked Hillary?"" Trump: ""I just said I like her. I say I like everybody."" And there was Kimmel, at every opportunity, happily mocking Trump, the overexposed media whore. \n \n The effect is not only not damaging, it\'s fun-loving, comic, even joyous. Kimmel is tickled to have such a good sport to poke fun at, and Trump is tickled that Kimmel is tickled. Everybody\'s in on it. There are no phonies here. Or everybody here is honest about being a phony. Nobody is taking anyone very seriously — forget what might be at stake in a presidential election. If Trump is the subject of the conversation, then Trump is happy. If Kimmel has Trump as a guest, he\'s happy. Everybody\'s happy. (Trump has a staffer take a picture of another picture of Trump when he was previously on the Kimmel show that\'s now hanging on the studio wall.) \n \n It is this media frisson that, with countless other professional and amateur analyzers, I\'m trying to plumb. Surely a big part of the answer lies in the nature of Trump\'s performance, an unself-consciousness so extreme that he has passed through hurdles of humiliation that would have destroyed nearly all others to emerge as though free of a private self. Trump is only fully alive in public. But another aspect is that, differentiating himself from every other candidate, he has a long, intimate relationship with nearly every significant player in the media and, indeed, lavishes copious praise on almost all of them. He may know few people in Washington, and care about them less, but he knows his moguls and where they rank on the modern suck-up-to list. \n \n On Murdoch: ""Rupert is a tremendous guy. I think Rupert [who for several years lived in the Trump building on 59th and Park Avenue in Manhattan] is one of the people I really respect and like. And I think Rupert respects what I\'ve done."" But what about Murdoch\'s grumpy Trump tweets? ""When I got into the world of politics, that was a different realm for me and maybe he felt differently. But I think he respects what I\'ve done and he\'s a tremendous guy and I think we have a very good relationship."" \n \n On Redstone: ""Sumner, well, he\'s had a good run. Good run. Terrible it comes to this, but a good run. He\'d give me anything. Loved me."" \n \n On Leslie Moonves: ""Great guy. The greatest. We\'re on the same page. We think alike."" \n \n These are the bulls of his real party. \n \n The party whips, to strain this metaphor, are the news heads: Roger Ailes at Fox News, Jeff Zucker at CNN (who previously at NBC bought The Apprentice and launched Trump as a national TV star) and Andy Lack, now the head of NBC News. Despite his tweets about the ""dishonest media,"" Trump is lavish in his praise of all of them. I ask him to rate them. ""That\'s an unfair question,"" he says, making a rare grab for politesse. ""I know Jeff very well. I know Roger very well. And, less well, but I think Andy has done a very good job."" \n \n Among his frequent media and now political confidants is WME co-CEO Ari Emanuel — whose brother, Rahm, the mayor of Chicago, was once Obama\'s chief of staff — whom Trump says has offered to take charge of the Trump celebratory convention film. Emanuel and Trump, while at seeming odds politically, might in fact be even better united in a kind of hyper salesmanship. ""He\'s a very good friend of mine,"" says Trump. ""He calls me a lot. I call him a lot and we talk. He\'s very political. Even though he\'s not political, he\'s political. He gets it. You\'re shocked to hear that, right? [About the movie.] But yeah, I might do something with Ari. Does he represent you?"" \n \n Sanders called a Trump win a ""real danger to the entire world"" on May 27. \n \n Trump will turn 70 on June 14, but he shows no sign of fatigue even as our conversation drifts toward 11 p.m. He\'s been at this since either 4 a.m. or 6 a.m. (he offers different times at different moments). ""Today, I\'m up at six in the morning, I\'m meeting some of the biggest people in the world. I then had to give a speech to a big group, then I had to give a speech at 12 to [Dole Food mogul] David Murdock, [real estate magnate] Donald Bren, tremendous guys. Then I had to drive to Anaheim and give a speech in front of thousands of people. Then I came back and did more meetings, then I did a fundraiser tonight, then I did Kimmel. And now you. You\'re not a two-minute interview guy."" \n \n He hands me a water bottle from the refrigerator (it only contains water and about a dozen pints of ice cream), and we walk through the dark house decorated with hotel-like furniture (a four-star rather than a five-star hotel lobby). He reclines, still in his standard boxy suit, tie slightly loosened, with his Haagen-Dazs on an overstuffed couch in the living room (he asks me not to put my water bottle on the fabric-covered ottoman). \n \n If there\'s any pattern to his conversation, it\'s that he\'s vague on all subjects outside himself, his campaign and the media. Everything else is mere distraction. But I press him about Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who, earlier in the day, has admitted to funding the $140 million Hulk Hogan lawsuit against Gawker. Thiel also is his most prominent Silicon Valley backer and will go to the convention in July as a pledged delegate. But Trump needs reminding who he is, and then concludes he must be a friend of his son-in-law Jared. (""Wow, I love him! So he funded it for Hulk Hogan? You think Hulk Hogan would have enough money, but he probably doesn\'t."") Indeed, Trump doesn\'t appear to be interested in Silicon Valley, except to roll off his numbers on each social media platform. (""On Facebook, I have close to 8 million people. On Twitter, I have 8.5 million. On Instagram, I have over a million people. I\'m inching on 20 million people. I have friends, somebody that\'s a great writer, where they write a book and call me up and say, \'Can you do me a favor, can you tweet it?\' "" ""Can you,"" I interject, ""tweet my book, please?"" ""I will!"") \n \n Finishing his pint, he reflects again on the remarkableness of the campaign, asking his traveling staffers, Corey Lewandowski and press secretary Hope Hicks, as well as his son-in-law, to confirm again how remarkable it is. Lewandowski recites the latest polls (as of press time, they show Trump inching to within a few percentage points of Clinton in a head-to-head matchup), and Trump, with something beyond confidence, seems to declare de facto victory. \n \n I broach his problems with women and Hispanics and the common wisdom that he\'ll have to do at least as well with these groups as Mitt Romney did in 2012. The ""pivot"" is the word more politico pros are using to refer to his expected turn to the center. ""Unless,"" I offer, ""you think you can remake the electoral math."" He says he absolutely can. So no pivot. ""It\'ll be different math than they\'ve ever seen."" He is, he says, bigger than anything anyone has ever seen. ""I have a much bigger base than Romney. Romney was a stiff!"" And he\'ll be bigger with the people he\'s bigger with, but also he\'ll be bigger with women and Hispanics and blacks, too. He believes, no matter what positions he holds or slurs he has made, that he is irresistible. \n \n I ask if he sees himself as having similarities with leaders of the growing anti-immigrant (some would say outright racist) European nativist movements, like Marine Le Pen in France and Matteo Salvini in Italy, whom The Wall Street Journal reported Trump had met with and endorsed in Philadelphia. (""Matteo, I wish you become the next Italian premier soon,"" Trump was quoted as saying.) In fact, he insists he didn\'t meet Salvini. ""I didn\'t want to meet him."" And, in sum, he doesn\'t particularly see similarities — or at least isn\'t interested in them — between those movements and the anti-immigrant nationalism he is promoting in this country. \n \n ""And Brexit? Your position?"" I ask. \n \n ""Huh?"" \n \n ""Brexit."" \n \n ""Hmm."" \n \n ""The Brits leaving the EU,"" I prompt, realizing that his lack of familiarity with one of the most pressing issues in Europe is for him no concern nor liability at all. \n \n ""Oh yeah, I think they should leave."" \n \n It is hard not to feel that Trump understands himself, and that we\'re all in on this kind of spectacular joke. His shamelessness is just so … shameless. So how much, I ask — quite thinking he will get the nuance here — is the Trump brand based on exaggeration? He responds, with perfect literalness, none at all. I try again. He must understand. How could he not? ""You\'ve talked about negotiation, which is about compromise and about establishing positions that you can walk back from. How much about being a successful person involves … well, bullshitting? How much of success is playing games?"" \n \n If he does understand, he\'s definitely not taking this bait. I try again: ""How much are you a salesman?"" \n \n Salesman, in the Trump worldview, is hardly a bad word, and he is quite willing to accept it, although, curiously, he doesn\'t want to be thought of that way when it comes to real estate. But as a politician, he\'s OK as a salesman. \n \n Trump says he\'s reading Edward Klein\'s book Unlikeable: The Problem With Hillary. \n \n In this, he sees himself — and becomes almost eloquent in talking about himself — as a sort of performer and voter whisperer. He is, he takes obvious pride in saying, the only politician who doesn\'t regularly use a teleprompter. With a prompter, he says, you can\'t work the crowd. You can\'t feel it. ""You got to look at them in the eye. Have you ever seen me speak in front of a large group of people? Have you ever watched?"" He reflects on the lack of self-consciousness that\'s necessary to make spontaneous utterances before a crowd. He cites a well-known actor (whose name he asks me not to use, ""I don\'t want to hurt anybody""), who had wanted to run for office but, without a script, was a blithering idiot. Trump was never fed lines on The Apprentice, he says. It was all him: ""You have to have a natural ability."" \n \n I ask if he\'ll use a teleprompter for his acceptance speech at the convention and, almost sorrowfully, he says he probably will. I find myself urging him not to, precisely for the theater of it all. The spontaneity. Who would want to miss that? Let Trump be Trump. \n \n ""Very interesting. What he\'s saying is very interesting,"" he notes to Lewandowski. \n \n He\'s punted on Hillary as a topic since we started our conversation, as though to talk about her was not to talk about him. If in public he needs to treat her as his cause, in private he doesn\'t want her taking up his time. But I sneak it back. \n \n ""Did you ever vote for Bill?"" I ask, thinking that both men have as much in common as they have that separates them. \n \n ""Let\'s see … did I ever? Eh, I don\'t want to say who I voted for."" \n \n Indeed. These two \'80s guys were undoubtedly once quite in sync. \n \n The anti-Christ Trump, the Trump of bizarre, outre, impractical and reactionary policies that most reasonable people yet believe will lead to an astounding defeat in November, is really hard to summon from Trump in person. He deflects that person, or, even, dissembles about what that person might have said (as much, he dissembles for conservatives about what the more liberal Trump might have said), and is impatient that anyone might want to focus on that version of Trump. It does then feel that the policies, such as they are, and the slurs, are not him. They are just a means to the end — to the phenomenon. To the center of attention. The biggest thing that has ever happened in politics. In America. The biggest thing is the theme. It\'s what he always wants to come back to. Bigness is unavoidable and inevitable. Bigness always wins. \n \n Before Trump trundles off to bed — actually, before that, never too tired, he plans to watch himself on Kimmel — I ask that de rigeur presidential question, which does not seem yet to have been asked of him. ""What books are you reading?"" \n \n He knows he\'s caught (it\'s a question that all politicians are prepped on, but who among his not-bookish coterie would have prepped him even with the standard GOP politician answer: the Bible?). But he goes for it. \n \n ""I\'m reading the Ed Klein book on Hillary Clinton"" — a particular hatchet job, which at the very least has certainly been digested for him. ""And I\'m reading the book on Richard Nixon that was, well, I\'ll get you the exact information on it. I\'m reading a book that I\'ve read before, it\'s one of my favorite books, All Quiet on the Western Front, which is one of the greatest books of all time."" And one I suspect he\'s suddenly remembering from high school. But what the hell. \n \n Donald Trump simply believes he is a unique individual, one whose singular conviction that he is special makes him appealing. And pay no attention to everything else. \n \n A version of this story first appeared in the June 10 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. To receive the magazine, click here to subscribe.', 'Author and columnist Michael Wolff was given extraordinary access to the Trump administration and now details the feuds, the fights and the alarming chaos he witnessed while reporting what turned into a new book. \n \n Editor’s Note: Author and Hollywood Reporter columnist Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House (Henry Holt & Co.), is a detailed account of the 45th president’s election and first year in office based on extensive access to the White House and more than 200 interviews with Trump and senior staff over a period of 18 months. In advance of the Jan. 9 publication of the book, which Trump is already attacking, Wolff has written this extracted column about his time in the White House based on the reporting included in Fire and Fury. \n \n I interviewed Donald Trump for The Hollywood Reporter in June 2016, and he seemed to have liked — or not disliked — the piece I wrote. ""Great cover!"" his press assistant, Hope Hicks, emailed me after it came out (it was a picture of a belligerent Trump in mirrored sunglasses). After the election, I proposed to him that I come to the White House and report an inside story for later publication — journalistically, as a fly on the wall — which he seemed to misconstrue as a request for a job. No, I said. I\'d like to just watch and write a book. ""A book?"" he responded, losing interest. ""I hear a lot of people want to write books,"" he added, clearly not understanding why anybody would. ""Do you know Ed Klein?""— author of several virulently anti-Hillary books. ""Great guy. I think he should write a book about me."" But sure, Trump seemed to say, knock yourself out. \n \n Since the new White House was often uncertain about what the president meant or did not mean in any given utterance, his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around — checking in each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, making appointments with various senior staffers who put my name in the ""system,"" and then wandering across the street to the White House and plunking myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch. \n \n The West Wing is configured in such a way that the anteroom is quite a thoroughfare — everybody passes by. Assistants — young women in the Trump uniform of short skirts, high boots, long and loose hair — as well as, in situation-comedy proximity, all the new stars of the show: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, Jared Kushner, Mike Pence, Gary Cohn, Michael Flynn (and after Flynn\'s abrupt departure less than a month into the job for his involvement in the Russia affair, his replacement, H.R. McMaster), all neatly accessible. \n \n The nature of the comedy, it was soon clear, was that here was a group of ambitious men and women who had reached the pinnacle of power, a high-ranking White House appointment — with the punchline that Donald Trump was president. Their estimable accomplishment of getting to the West Wing risked at any moment becoming farce. \n \n A new president typically surrounds himself with a small group of committed insiders and loyalists. But few on the Trump team knew him very well — most of his advisors had been with him only since the fall. Even his family, now closely gathered around him, seemed nonplussed. ""You know, we never saw that much of him until he got the nomination,"" Eric Trump\'s wife, Lara, told one senior staffer. If much of the country was incredulous, his staff, trying to cement their poker faces, were at least as confused. \n \n Their initial response was to hawkishly defend him — he demanded it — and by defending him they seemed to be defending themselves. Politics is a game, of course, of determined role-playing, but the difficulties of staying in character in the Trump White House became evident almost from the first day. \n \n ""You can\'t make this shit up,"" Sean Spicer, soon to be portrayed as the most hapless man in America, muttered to himself after his tortured press briefing on the first day of the new administration, when he was called to justify the president\'s inaugural crowd numbers — and soon enough, he adopted this as a personal mantra. Reince Priebus, the new chief of staff, had, shortly after the announcement of his appointment in November, started to think he would not last until the inauguration. Then, making it to the White House, he hoped he could last a respectable year, but he quickly scaled back his goal to six months. Kellyanne Conway, who would put a finger-gun to her head in private about Trump\'s public comments, continued to mount an implacable defense on cable television, until she was pulled off the air by others in the White House who, however much the president enjoyed her, found her militancy idiotic. (Even Ivanka and Jared regarded Conway\'s fulsome defenses as cringeworthy.) \n \n Steve Bannon tried to gamely suggest that Trump was mere front man and that he, with plan and purpose and intellect, was, more reasonably, running the show — commanding a whiteboard of policies and initiatives that he claimed to have assembled from Trump\'s off-the-cuff ramblings and utterances. His adoption of the Saturday Night Live sobriquet ""President Bannon"" was less than entirely humorous. Within the first few weeks, even rote conversations with senior staff trying to explain the new White House\'s policies and positions would turn into a body-language ballet of eye-rolling and shrugs and pantomime of jaws dropping. Leaking became the political manifestation of the don\'t-blame-me eye roll. \n \n The surreal sense of the Trump presidency was being lived as intensely inside the White House as out. Trump was, for the people closest to him, the ultimate enigma. He had been elected president, that through-the-eye-of-the-needle feat, but obviously, he was yet … Trump. Indeed, he seemed as confused as anyone to find himself in the White House, even attempting to barricade himself into his bedroom with his own lock over the protests of the Secret Service. \n \n There was some effort to ascribe to Trump magical powers. In an early conversation — half comic, half desperate — Bannon tried to explain him as having a particular kind of Jungian brilliance. Trump, obviously without having read Jung, somehow had access to the collective unconscious of the other half of the country, and, too, a gift for inventing archetypes: Little Marco … Low-Energy Jeb … the Failing New York Times. Everybody in the West Wing tried, with some panic, to explain him, and, sheepishly, their own reason for being here. He\'s intuitive, he gets it, he has a mind-meld with his base. But there was palpable relief, of an Emperor\'s New Clothes sort, when longtime Trump staffer Sam Nunberg — fired by Trump during the campaign but credited with knowing him better than anyone else — came back into the fold and said, widely, ""He\'s just a fucking fool."" \n \n Part of that foolishness was his inability to deal with his own family. In a way, this gave him a human dimension. Even Donald Trump couldn\'t say no to his kids. ""It\'s a littleee, littleee complicated …"" he explained to Priebus about why he needed to give his daughter and son-in-law official jobs. But the effect of their leadership roles was to compound his own boundless inexperience in Washington, creating from the outset frustration and then disbelief and then rage on the part of the professionals in his employ. \n \n The men and women of the West Wing, for all that the media was ridiculing them, actually felt they had a responsibility to the country. ""Trump,"" said one senior Republican, ""turned selfish careerists into patriots."" Their job was to maintain the pretense of relative sanity, even as each individually came to the conclusion that, in generous terms, it was insane to think you could run a White House without experience, organizational structure or a real purpose. \n \n On March 30, after the collapse of the health care bill, 32-year-old Katie Walsh, the deputy chief of staff, the effective administration chief of the West Wing, a stalwart political pro and stellar example of governing craft, walked out. Little more than two months in, she quit. Couldn\'t take it anymore. Nutso. To lose your deputy chief of staff at the get-go would be a sign of crisis in any other administration, but inside an obviously exploding one it was hardly noticed. \n \n While there might be a scary national movement of Trumpers, the reality in the White House was stranger still: There was Jared and Ivanka, Democrats; there was Priebus, a mainstream Republican; and there was Bannon, whose reasonable claim to be the one person actually representing Trumpism so infuriated Trump that Bannon was hopelessly sidelined by April. ""How much influence do you think Steve Bannon has over me? Zero! Zero!"" Trump muttered and stormed. To say that no one was in charge, that there were no guiding principles, not even a working org chart, would again be an understatement. ""What do these people do?"" asked everyone pretty much of everyone else. \n \n The competition to take charge, which, because each side represented an inimical position to the other, became not so much a struggle for leadership, but a near-violent factional war. Jared and Ivanka were against Priebus and Bannon, trying to push both men out. Bannon was against Jared and Ivanka and Priebus, practicing what everybody thought were dark arts against them. Priebus, everybody\'s punching bag, just tried to survive another day. By late spring, the larger political landscape seemed to become almost irrelevant, with everyone focused on the more lethal battles within the White House itself. This included screaming fights in the halls and in front of a bemused Trump in the Oval Office (when he was not the one screaming himself), together with leaks about what Russians your opponents might have been talking to. \n \n Reigning over all of this was Trump, enigma, cipher and disruptor. How to get along with Trump — who veered between a kind of blissed-out pleasure of being in the Oval Office and a deep, childish frustration that he couldn\'t have what he wanted? Here was a man singularly focused on his own needs for instant gratification, be that a hamburger, a segment on Fox & Friends or an Oval Office photo opp. ""I want a win. I want a win. Where\'s my win?"" he would regularly declaim. He was, in words used by almost every member of the senior staff on repeated occasions, ""like a child."" A chronic naysayer, Trump himself stoked constant discord with his daily after-dinner phone calls to his billionaire friends about the disloyalty and incompetence around him. His billionaire friends then shared this with their billionaire friends, creating the endless leaks which the president so furiously railed against. \n \n One of these frequent callers was Rupert Murdoch, who before the election had only ever expressed contempt for Trump. Now Murdoch constantly sought him out, but to his own colleagues, friends and family, continued to derisively ridicule Trump: ""What a fucking moron,"" said Murdoch after one call. \n \n With the Comey firing, the Mueller appointment and murderous White House infighting, by early summer Bannon was engaged in an uninterrupted monologue directed to almost anyone who would listen. It was so caustic, so scabrous and so hilarious that it might form one of the great underground political treatises. \n \n By July, Jared and Ivanka, who had, in less than six months, traversed from socialite couple to royal family to the most powerful people in the world, were now engaged in a desperate dance to save themselves, which mostly involved blaming Trump himself. It was all his idea to fire Comey! ""The daughter,"" Bannon declared, ""will bring down the father."" \n \n Priebus and Spicer were merely counting down to the day — and every day seemed to promise it would be the next day — when they would be out. \n \n And, indeed, suddenly there were the 11 days of Anthony Scaramucci. \n \n Scaramucci, a minor figure in the New York financial world, and quite a ridiculous one, had overnight become Jared and Ivanka\'s solution to all of the White House\'s management and messaging problems. After all, explained the couple, he was good on television and he was from New York — he knew their world. In effect, the couple had hired Scaramucci — as preposterous a hire in West Wing annals as any — to replace Priebus and Bannon and take over running the White House. \n \n There was, after the abrupt Scaramucci meltdown, hardly any effort inside the West Wing to disguise the sense of ludicrousness and anger felt by every member of the senior staff toward Trump\'s family and Trump himself. It became almost a kind of competition to demystify Trump. For Rex Tillerson, he was a moron. For Gary Cohn, he was dumb as shit. For H.R. McMaster, he was a hopeless idiot. For Steve Bannon, he had lost his mind. \n \n Most succinctly, no one expected him to survive Mueller. Whatever the substance of the Russia ""collusion,"" Trump, in the estimation of his senior staff, did not have the discipline to navigate a tough investigation, nor the credibility to attract the caliber of lawyers he would need to help him. (At least nine major law firms had turned down an invitation to represent the president.) \n \n There was more: Everybody was painfully aware of the increasing pace of his repetitions. It used to be inside of 30 minutes he\'d repeat, word-for-word and expression-for-expression, the same three stories — now it was within 10 minutes. Indeed, many of his tweets were the product of his repetitions — he just couldn\'t stop saying something. \n \n By summer\'s end, in something of a historic sweep — more usual for the end of a president\'s first term than the end of his first six months — almost the entire senior staff, save Trump\'s family, had been washed out: Michael Flynn, Katie Walsh, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon. Even Trump\'s loyal, longtime body guard Keith Schiller — for reasons darkly whispered about in the West Wing — was out. Gary Cohn, Dina Powell, Rick Dearborn, all on their way out. The president, on the spur of the moment, appointed John Kelly, a former Marine Corps general and head of homeland security, chief of staff — without Kelly having been informed of his own appointment beforehand. Grim and stoic, accepting that he could not control the president, Kelly seemed compelled by a sense of duty to be, in case of disaster, the adult in the room who might, if needed, stand up to the president … if that is comfort. \n \n As telling, with his daughter and son-in-law sidelined by their legal problems, Hope Hicks, Trump\'s 29-year-old personal aide and confidant, became, practically speaking, his most powerful White House advisor. (With Melania a nonpresence, the staff referred to Ivanka as the ""real wife"" and Hicks as the ""real daughter."") Hicks\' primary function was to tend to the Trump ego, to reassure him, to protect him, to buffer him, to soothe him. It was Hicks who, attentive to his lapses and repetitions, urged him to forgo an interview that was set to open the 60 Minutes fall season. Instead, the interview went to Fox News\' Sean Hannity who, White House insiders happily explained, was willing to supply the questions beforehand. Indeed, the plan was to have all interviewers going forward provide the questions. \n \n As the first year wound down, Trump finally got a bill to sign. The tax bill, his singular accomplishment, was, arguably, quite a reversal of his populist promises, and confirmation of what Mitch McConnell had seen early on as the silver Trump lining: ""He\'ll sign anything we put in front of him."" With new bravado, he was encouraging partisans like Fox News to pursue an anti-Mueller campaign on his behalf. Insiders believed that the only thing saving Mueller from being fired, and the government of the United States from unfathomable implosion, is Trump\'s inability to grasp how much Mueller had on him and his family. \n \n Steve Bannon was openly handicapping a 33.3 percent chance of impeachment, a 33.3 percent chance of resignation in the shadow of the 25th amendment and a 33.3 percent chance that he might limp to the finish line on the strength of liberal arrogance and weakness. \n \n Donald Trump\'s small staff of factotums, advisors and family began, on Jan. 20, 2017, an experience that none of them, by any right or logic, thought they would — or, in many cases, should — have, being part of a Trump presidency. Hoping for the best, with their personal futures as well as the country\'s future depending on it, my indelible impression of talking to them and observing them through much of the first year of his presidency, is that they all — 100 percent — came to believe he was incapable of functioning in his job. \n \n At Mar-a-Lago, just before the new year, a heavily made-up Trump failed to recognize a succession of old friends. \n \n Happy first anniversary of the Trump administration.']",2,"– The quotes are so incendiary that some are questioning their veracity. But Axios reports Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House author Michael Wolff has ""dozens of hours"" of tapes to back up statements that appear in the book. And in an excerpt running in the Hollywood Reporter, Wolff (who is the co-founder of Newser) explains just how he got access to them. A June 2016 Hollywood Reporter article may have helped grease things: Hope Hicks emailed Wolff to say Trump was pleased with the cover. Post-election, Wolff says he floated the idea of him coming to the White House ""journalistically, as a fly on the wall"" to gather information for a future book. Trump seemed disinterested in the idea of a book, but ""his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around,"" writes Wolff. And so Wolff writes he spent each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, scheduled appointments with senior staffers, and ""plunk[ed] myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch."" The excerpt shares other tidbits—how the Secret Service protested the president's attempts to lock himself in his bedroom; how Trump's post-dinner calls to billionaire pals spurred leaks; how Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump thought Anthony Scaramucci would be the White House's saving grace—which Trump's lawyer is now trying to block from release. The Washington Post reports Wolff and his publisher, Henry Holt and Co., have been sent a letter that demands they ""immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release, or dissemination of the book"" or any excerpts; the lawyer also wants a copy and says a libel suit is being considered."

Exactly who owns it is the subject of a federal lawsuit filed in San Francisco that reads like an Isaac Asimov sci-fi tale. \n \n A Novato man says it’s rightfully his. A Massachusetts couple say they paid the Novato man $425,000 for it and that it’s rightfully theirs. \n \n The Novato man says he canceled the sale when he found out the Massachusetts couple were running a rock museum in Maine. The Massachusetts couple say the Novato man canceled the sale because of seller’s remorse, when he figured he let the $425,000 rock go on the cheap. \n \n Meanwhile, a New York rock broker and two Kansas rock polishers say they’re entitled to a piece of the action, too. \n \n LATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing 4:20 pm on 4/20 at Hippie Hill Ted Andersen, SFGATE \n \n The Waldos at 4:20 p.m. on 4/20 David Downs \n \n Interview with the Waldos on 4/20 David Downs \n \n 'Blindspotting' trailer San Francisco Chronicle \n \n Cannabis revelers descend on Hippie Hil Paul Chinn, The Chronicle \n \n The real meaning of 420 Alix Martichoux / SFGATE \n \n Coast Guard search and rescue Ted Andersen, SFGATE \n \n Emeryville Police release video of robbery suspects San Francisco Chronicle \n \n 1906 Earthquake commemoration Douglas Zimmerman, SFGate \n \n Audio: Southwest Flight 1380 emergency landing via Broadcastify \n \n The tale begins 4 billion years ago, give or take an eon, when the meteorite plummeted to earth and landed in the Gobi Desert of China. In 2000, it was discovered, and pieces of it began to be sold to well-heeled rock hounds, one of whom was Stephan Settgast of Novato, who said he bought a 220-pound slice of it in 2004. \n \n In 2014, court documents say, Settgast agreed to sell the slice to Lawrence Stifler and Mary McFadden of Brookline, Mass., who paid him $425,000 through a New York meteorite middleman. \n \n But after the rock polishers, Keith and Dana Jenkerson of Osawatomie, Kan., who had been hired to spiff up the meteorite for its new owners, said they thought it was worth perhaps $1 million, Settgast decided he wanted his rock back, the Massachusetts couple say. \n \n Settgast went to the Jenkersons’ studio and, while they were away at a rock show, entered the premises and took back the meteorite. It was a clear case of meteorite-napping, said the spurned buyers. \n \n Settgast maintained he was reclaiming the rock because the couple planned to put it on public display at their under-construction museum in Maine. Settgast said that violated the terms of the sale. Stifler and McFadden said a no-museum promise was never part of the deal. They say Settgast has their rock and their money, too. \n \n Settgast sued in federal court in February to invalidate the sale and keep the rock. Stifler and McFadden countersued in March to get their hands on the rock. \n \n Nobody knows what a one-of-a-kind meteorite is worth, according to Settgast’s lawyer, Curt Edmondson. \n \n “It’s not like it’s a Toyota,” he said. \n \n Edmondson denied that Settgast stole back the meteorite or planned to keep the money. He said Settgast had never formally turned over the meteorite, despite being paid for it, and was entitled to take it back because it was still his. \n \n “It’s not like he went to Kansas and jimmied the lock on the back door and put a 220-pound rock under his arm,” Edmondson said. \n \n Court documents suggest one reason the rock polishers valued the rock at $1 million is that they believed they were entitled to 5 percent of its value for their services. They were seeking $50,000 for spiffing it up, instead of the $20,000 they had been promised and eventually accepted. \n \n Rock hounds say rare meteorites of the Fukang variety, known as pallasites, are beautiful and valuable but not particularly scientifically significant. \n \n “This kind of meteorite has been studied and has little new to tell us,” said Paul Doherty, senior scientist at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. “It came from the core-mantle boundary of an asteroid. We have studied lots of meteorites of this kind. It doesn’t need to be in a museum. If it was a Martian meteorite, that would be different.” \n \n Settgast, Stifler and McFadden did not return calls seeking comment.

I tried to make her human,"" she said in Venice. \n \n At the Toronto International Film Festival, Madonna added that Wallis ""was and is a very provocative character. She is also a mysterious and enigmatic creature, not conventionally beautiful, not young, twice divorced, not anything fabulous about her background and somehow she managed to capture the heart of the man who at the time held the most important position in the world. \n \n ""That story intrigued me immensely and I wanted to understand it."" \n \n ""But also I was interested in the concept of the cult of celebrity which we are all consumed with now, and then."" \n \n Polish classical composer Abel Korzeniowski set up the movie\'s haunting score. \n \n He tried to explain to reporters that Madonna had urged him to ""not try to be talented."" Madonna interrupted, ""No, I said: \'Don\'t over-think it.\' I always wanted you to be talented."" \n \n The clash of his classical and Madonna\'s pop backgrounds, he continued, resulted in ""the most interesting thing."" \n \n ""I found myself learning very interesting things (from Madonna) about music, which helped me in my classical thinking,"" Korzeniowski added. \n \n During filming, it was also revealed that Madonna and the cast held sing-a-longs ""to pass the time"" during rainy days when shooting was interrupted. \n \n In Toronto, Madonna serenaded journalists with a few impromptu lyrics they had sung together: ""We\'re making a movie, isn\'t it groovy, welcome to my house"". \n \n But Madonna has already conquered the music industry, and is more focused on filmmaking now. \n \n ""I had to earn my way ... to be taken seriously in the music department, and now I\'m well aware that I have to do the same in the world of film,"" she said, welcoming critics\' reviews of her film (not her personal life). \n \n W.E is scheduled for wide release in December at the peak of the pre-Oscar season. ""I\'m keeping my legs and fingers crossed"" for a nod, she quipped.']",2,"– The final surviving member of the singing von Trapp family that fled the Nazis in World War II and inspired The Sound of Music has died at the age of 99 in Stowe, Vt. Maria von Trapp was the third of seven children of Georg von Trapp and his first wife; she was the inspiration for Louisa in the famous musical and film. ""She was a lovely woman who was one of the few truly good people,"" said brother Johannes von Trapp, a son born later to Georg von Trapp and his second wife, also named Maria. ""There wasn't a mean or miserable bone in her body. I think everyone who knew her would agree with that."" After escaping Austria, the von Trapps settled in Stowe, eventually opening a ski lodge, where Maria von Trapp played accordion and taught Austrian dance with a younger sister. She recalled, well, the sounds of music surrounding her early years in an online biography, notes the AP. ""Father played the violin, accordion, and mandolin. Mother played piano and violin,"" she wrote. ""I have fond memories of our grandmother playing the piano for us after meals."" She also served as a missionary in Papua, New Guinea. The family was fairly long-lived: Maria's older sister, Agathe, died three years ago at age 97."

Lies have oozed out of the White House for more than two centuries and out of politicians’ mouths — out of all people’s mouths — likely as long as there has been human speech. \n \n But amid all those lies, told to ourselves and to one another in order to amass power, woo lovers, hurt enemies and shield ourselves against the often glaring discomfort of reality, humanity has always had an abiding respect for truth. \n \n Support our journalism Become a subscriber today to support editorial writing like this. Start getting full access to our signature journalism for just 99 cents for the first four weeks. \n \n In the United States, born and periodically reborn out of the repeated recognition and rejection of the age-old lie that some people are meant to take dominion over others, truth is as vital a part of the civic, social and intellectual culture as justice and liberty. Our civilization is premised on the conviction that such a thing as truth exists, that it is knowable, that it is verifiable, that it exists independently of authority or popularity and that at some point — and preferably sooner rather than later — it will prevail. \n \n Even American leaders who lie generally know the difference between their statements and the truth. Richard Nixon said “I am not a crook” but by that point must have seen that he was. Bill Clinton said “I did not have sexual relations with that woman” but knew that he did. \n \n “ He targets the darkness, anger and insecurity that hide in each of us and harnesses them for his own purposes. ” Share this quote \n \n The insult that Donald Trump brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth. \n \n His approach succeeds because of his preternaturally deft grasp of his audience. Though he is neither terribly articulate nor a seasoned politician, he has a remarkable instinct for discerning which conspiracy theories in which quasi-news source, or which of his own inner musings, will turn into ratings gold. He targets the darkness, anger and insecurity that hide in each of us and harnesses them for his own purposes. If one of his lies doesn’t work — well, then he lies about that. \n \n If we harbor latent racism or if we fear terror attacks by Muslim extremists, then he elevates a rumor into a public debate: Was Barack Obama born in Kenya, and is he therefore not really president? \n \n An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2012 Libya is being taken over by Islamic radicals—-with @BarackObama's open support. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2011 \n \n If his own ego is threatened — if broadcast footage and photos show a smaller-sized crowd at his inauguration than he wanted — then he targets the news media, falsely charging outlets with disseminating “fake news” and insisting, against all evidence, that he has proved his case (“We caught them in a beauty,” he said). \n \n If his attempt to limit the number of Muslim visitors to the U.S. degenerates into an absolute fiasco and a display of his administration’s incompetence, then he falsely asserts that terrorist attacks are underreported. (One case in point offered by the White House was the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, which in fact received intensive worldwide news coverage. The Los Angeles Times won a Pulitzer Prize for its reporting on the subject). \n \n If he detects that his audience may be wearying of his act, or if he worries about a probe into Russian meddling into the election that put him in office, he tweets in the middle of the night the astonishingly absurd claim that President Obama tapped his phones. And when evidence fails to support him he dispatches his aides to explain that by “phone tapping” he obviously didn’t mean phone tapping. Instead of backing down when confronted with reality, he insists that his rebutted assertions will be vindicated as true at some point in the future. \n \n Trump’s easy embrace of untruth can sometimes be entertaining, in the vein of a Moammar Kadafi speech to the United Nations or the self-serving blathering of a 6-year-old. \n \n “ He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief. ” Share this quote \n \n But he is not merely amusing. He is dangerous. His choice of falsehoods and his method of spewing them — often in tweets, as if he spent his days and nights glued to his bedside radio and was periodically set off by some drivel uttered by a talk show host who repeated something he’d read on some fringe blog — are a clue to Trump’s thought processes and perhaps his lack of agency. He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief. \n \n He has made himself the stooge, the mark, for every crazy blogger, political quack, racial theorist, foreign leader or nutcase peddling a story that he might repackage to his benefit as a tweet, an appointment, an executive order or a policy. He is a stranger to the concept of verification, the insistence on evidence and the standards of proof that apply in a courtroom or a medical lab — and that ought to prevail in the White House. \n \n There have always been those who accept the intellectually bankrupt notion that people are entitled to invent their own facts — consider the “9/11 was an inside job” trope — but Trump’s ascent marks the first time that the culture of alternative reality has made its home at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \n \n If Americans are unsure which Trump they have — the Machiavellian negotiator who lies to manipulate simpler minds, or one of those simpler minds himself — does it really matter? In either case he puts the nation in danger by undermining the role of truth in public discourse and policymaking, as well as the notion of truth being verifiable and mutually intelligible. \n \n In the months ahead, Trump will bring his embrace of alternative facts on the nation’s behalf into talks with China, North Korea or any number of powers with interests counter to ours and that constitute an existential threat. At home, Trump now becomes the embodiment of the populist notion (with roots planted at least as deeply in the Left as the Right) that verifiable truth is merely a concept invented by fusty intellectuals, and that popular leaders can provide some equally valid substitute. We’ve seen people like that before, and we have a name for them: demagogues. \n \n Our civilization is defined in part by the disciplines — science, law, journalism — that have developed systematic methods to arrive at the truth. Citizenship brings with it the obligation to engage in a similar process. Good citizens test assumptions, question leaders, argue details, research claims. \n \n Investigate. Read. Write. Listen. Speak. Think. Be wary of those who disparage the investigators, the readers, the writers, the listeners, the speakers and the thinkers. Be suspicious of those who confuse reality with reality TV, and those who repeat falsehoods while insisting, against all evidence, that they are true. To defend freedom, demand fact. \n \n This is the second in a series."", 'It was no secret during the campaign that Donald Trump was a narcissist and a demagogue who used fear and dishonesty to appeal to the worst in American voters. The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a “catastrophe.” \n \n Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck. Like millions of other Americans, we clung to a slim hope that the new president would turn out to be all noise and bluster, or that the people around him in the White House would act as a check on his worst instincts, or that he would be sobered and transformed by the awesome responsibilities of office. \n \n Instead, seventy-some days in — and with about 1,400 to go before his term is completed — it is increasingly clear that those hopes were misplaced. \n \n Support our journalism Become a subscriber today to support editorial writing like this. Start getting full access to our signature journalism for just 99 cents for the first four weeks. \n \n In a matter of weeks, President Trump has taken dozens of real-life steps that, if they are not reversed, will rip families apart, foul rivers and pollute the air, intensify the calamitous effects of climate change and profoundly weaken the system of American public education for all. \n \n His attempt to de-insure millions of people who had finally received healthcare coverage and, along the way, enact a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich has been put on hold for the moment. But he is proceeding with his efforts to defang the government’s regulatory agencies and bloat the Pentagon’s budget even as he supposedly retreats from the global stage. \n \n “ It is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. ” Share this quote \n \n These are immensely dangerous developments which threaten to weaken this country’s moral standing in the world, imperil the planet and reverse years of slow but steady gains by marginalized or impoverished Americans. But, chilling as they are, these radically wrongheaded policy choices are not, in fact, the most frightening aspect of the Trump presidency. \n \n What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation — these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his scorched-earth outsider campaign; indeed, some of them helped get him elected. But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous. \n \n Although his policies are, for the most part, variations on classic Republican positions (many of which would have been undertaken by a President Ted Cruz or a President Marco Rubio), they become far more dangerous in the hands of this imprudent and erratic man. Many Republicans, for instance, support tighter border security and a tougher response to illegal immigration, but Trump’s cockamamie border wall, his impracticable campaign promise to deport all 11 million people living in the country illegally and his blithe disregard for the effect of such proposals on the U.S. relationship with Mexico turn a very bad policy into an appalling one. \n \n In the days ahead, The Times editorial board will look more closely at the new president, with a special attention to three troubling traits: \n \n 1Trump’s shocking lack of respect for those fundamental rules and institutions on which our government is based. Since Jan. 20, he has repeatedly disparaged and challenged those entities that have threatened his agenda, stoking public distrust of essential institutions in a way that undermines faith in American democracy. He has questioned the qualifications of judges and the integrity of their decisions, rather than acknowledging that even the president must submit to the rule of law. He has clashed with his own intelligence agencies, demeaned government workers and questioned the credibility of the electoral system and the Federal Reserve. He has lashed out at journalists, declaring them “enemies of the people,” rather than defending the importance of a critical, independent free press. His contempt for the rule of law and the norms of government are palpable. \n \n 2His utter lack of regard for truth. Whether it is the easily disprovable boasts about the size of his inauguration crowd or his unsubstantiated assertion that Barack Obama bugged Trump Tower, the new president regularly muddies the waters of fact and fiction. It’s difficult to know whether he actually can’t distinguish the real from the unreal — or whether he intentionally conflates the two to befuddle voters, deflect criticism and undermine the very idea of objective truth. Whatever the explanation, he is encouraging Americans to reject facts, to disrespect science, documents, nonpartisanship and the mainstream media — and instead to simply take positions on the basis of ideology and preconceived notions. This is a recipe for a divided country in which differences grow deeper and rational compromise becomes impossible. \n \n 3His scary willingness to repeat alt-right conspiracy theories, racist memes and crackpot, out-of-the-mainstream ideas. Again, it is not clear whether he believes them or merely uses them. But to cling to disproven “alternative” facts; to retweet racists; to make unverifiable or false statements about rigged elections and fraudulent voters; to buy into discredited conspiracy theories first floated on fringe websites and in supermarket tabloids — these are all of a piece with the Barack Obama birther claptrap that Trump was peddling years ago and which brought him to political prominence. It is deeply alarming that a president would lend the credibility of his office to ideas that have been rightly rejected by politicians from both major political parties. \n \n Where will this end? Will Trump moderate his crazier campaign positions as time passes? Or will he provoke confrontation with Iran, North Korea or China, or disobey a judge’s order or order a soldier to violate the Constitution? Or, alternately, will the system itself — the Constitution, the courts, the permanent bureaucracy, the Congress, the Democrats, the marchers in the streets — protect us from him as he alienates more and more allies at home and abroad, steps on his own message and creates chaos at the expense of his ability to accomplish his goals? Already, Trump’s job approval rating has been hovering in the mid-30s, according to Gallup, a shockingly low level of support for a new president. And that was before his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, offered to cooperate last week with congressional investigators looking into the connection between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. \n \n “ Those who oppose the new president’s reckless and heartless agenda must make their voices heard. ” Share this quote \n \n On Inauguration Day, we wrote on this page that it was not yet time to declare a state of “wholesale panic” or to call for blanket “non-cooperation” with the Trump administration. Despite plenty of dispiriting signals, that is still our view. The role of the rational opposition is to stand up for the rule of law, the electoral process, the peaceful transfer of power and the role of institutions; we should not underestimate the resiliency of a system in which laws are greater than individuals and voters are as powerful as presidents. This nation survived Andrew Jackson and Richard Nixon. It survived slavery. It survived devastating wars. Most likely, it will survive again. \n \n But if it is to do so, those who oppose the new president’s reckless and heartless agenda must make their voices heard. Protesters must raise their banners. Voters must turn out for elections. Members of Congress — including and especially Republicans — must find the political courage to stand up to Trump. Courts must safeguard the Constitution. State legislators must pass laws to protect their citizens and their policies from federal meddling. All of us who are in the business of holding leaders accountable must redouble our efforts to defend the truth from his cynical assaults. \n \n The United States is not a perfect country, and it has a great distance to go before it fully achieves its goals of liberty and equality. But preserving what works and defending the rules and values on which democracy depends are a shared responsibility. Everybody has a role to play in this drama. \n \n This is the first in a series.']",2,"– It's not unusual for newspaper editorials to criticize a president's policies. But the editorial board at the Los Angeles Times is taking the concept to a new level with a multi-part series called ""Our Dishonest President."" Part one on Sunday issued a warning that President Trump is ""so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation."" Those traits may have helped him get elected as an ""outsider,"" but hopes that they would be reined in once he entered the White House are fading. The editorial ends with a plea for voters, protesters, members of Congress, state legislators, the courts, the media, etc., to be vigilant about protecting America from its own president. On Monday, part two focuses on Trump's capacity to lie. Plenty of politicians lie, of course, but what Trump ""brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth."" What makes this especially dangerous is that Trump repeats the lies of others, even crackpots. ""He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief."" Verification seems to be a foreign concept to Trump, but it can't be for everyone else, write the editors, who close with advice: ""Investigate. Read. Write. Listen. Speak. Think. ...
