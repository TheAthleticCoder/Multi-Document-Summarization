"– A defrocked priest at the heart of Boston's Catholic clergy sex abuse scandal was released from prison Friday and settled into an apartment across the street from a children's dance studio. Paul Shanley, who was convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, 65 miles west of Boston, after his release from the Old Colony Correctional Center, where he served a 12-year sentence. Shanley, 86, used a cane and was helped by a man as he arrived in Ware. His new home in a multiunit building is across from a recently opened dance studio that teaches children as young as 2. The studio's owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install ""state-of-the-art"" security systems and to make sure every child leaves with an adult. “It’s terrible ... that he’s moving across the street, but there’s nobody who is better to be his neighbor than me because all I do is make kids safe,"" Lask tells the Boston Herald. As a condition of Shanley's 10-year probation, the AP reports that he has been ordered to have no contact with children under age 16. Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender, though psychologists citing Shanley's advanced age and health issues concluded his likelihood to reoffend is low. ""I'm sure that law enforcement will ensure that the community feels safe, and I have every expectation that they are going to ... be certain that Paul Shanley also remains safe,"" says Shanley's lawyer. ""Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children,"" argues an attorney who represented dozens of Shanley's accusers.","[""Shanley was a street priest who ministered to alienated youths in the 1960s and '70s"", 'Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender and posters will be displayed around town notifying the public that Shanley is living in the area, which is typical procedure for the police department', '""Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children,"" Garabedian said', ""Reporting by the Globe's Spotlight team helped break open the priest sex abuse scandal in the Archdiocese of Boston in 2002"", 'Paul Shanley, who had been convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west of Boston, after being released from the Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater, where he completed a 12-year sentence', 'The studio\'s owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install ""state-of-the-art"" security systems and to make sure every child leaves the studio accompanied by an adult', ""They also cited Shanley's health issues, which were blacked out from the reports, and the fact his last reported offense was in 1990"", '""It\'s awful that he\'s even on the streets of Ware,"" Lask told The Boston Globe', 'The reporting uncovered how dozens of priests in the archdiocese had molested and raped children for decades while church higher-ups covered it up and shuffled abusive priests from parish to parish', ""Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represented dozens of men who say they were abused by Shanley, said the evaluations were incomplete because the psychologists didn't interview Shanley"", 'Shanley will be at least the third sex offender living on his street, he said', ""The state's sex offender registry designates Shanley as a Level 3 offender, considered the most likely to reoffend"", ""said he understands the reaction from those who opposed Shanley's release from prison""]"
"– Women suffering from a heart attack seem to have a better chance of survival if they're treated by a female doctor, according to a new study in PNAS. Using data on 582,000 heart attack patients admitted to Florida emergency rooms from 1991 to 2010, researchers found that women treated by male doctors were 1.5% less likely to survive than males treated by female doctors. Reuters frames it this way: If 1,000 women went to the ER with a heart attack, 15 more would die if treated by a man. Survival rates also increased if there were many female physicians in the ER, suggesting that female doctors assist their male colleagues in diagnosis, per the Guardian. So what's going on? ""Since heart disease is often cast as a 'male' condition, male physicians might not pick up on the atypical presentation symptoms women more often show, or at least not to the degree that female physicians do,"" says lead author Brad Greenwood. While more research is needed, ""the key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,"" he adds. That doesn't mean female patients should seek out female doctors, who presided over just 10% of the study cases, per Reuters. While calling for better gender diversity in medicine, the study authors note that careful evaluations of symptoms could prevent critical delays in treatment. (Breastfeeding may help the heart.)","['That means if 1,000 women went to the emergency room with a heart attack, 15 more would die if they were treated by a male doctor, study leaded Brad Greenwood of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities told Reuters Health', 'Greenwood suspects the excess deaths are due to delays in treatment because the male doctors took longer to diagnose the heart attack', 'However, the team found that when patients shared the same gender as their doctor, they were more likely to survive, with the probability of death falling by just over 0', '“As a doctor who is very aware of gender bias particularly as it relates to cardiac disease, one can’t help but wonder if improved outcomes stem from the fact that female physicians take women’s symptoms more seriously, thereby expediting the workup and cardiac care of these women and improving mortality,” Haythe told Reuters Health', '“We find that gender concordance increases a patient’s probability of surviving a [heart attack] and that the effect is driven by increased mortality when male physicians treat female patients,” said Dr Brad Greenwood, associate professor of information and decision sciences at the University of Minnesota', '52 percent less likely to survive than men treated by female doctors, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences', 'The team also found women were more likely to survive if the emergency department had a higher proportion of female doctors who had treated heart attacks – a trend particularly strong if the woman was being treated by a male doctor', 'In addition, the more female patients a male doctor had previously treated for heart attacks, the better the chances of survival a woman had', 'What’s more, Gale noted that as in the UK, US patients are generally seen by a number of healthcare professionals if they seek medical help, meaning that looking at the gender of just one doctor is a limitation', '” (Reuters Health) - Women who show up in the emergency room with a heart attack are less likely to die if they are treated by a female physician rather than a male, a new study finds', 'In this work, we posit that these difficulties may be partially explained, or exacerbated, by the gender match between the patient and the physician', 'Intriguingly, women treated by a male doctor were more likely to survive if there were many female physicians in the ER', '5 percentage points less likely to survive a heart attack than male patients in the care of female doctors', 'Chris Gale, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the latest research but has worked on previous studies in the field, welcomed the new research but cautioned that the study was based on US data, meaning it is not clear if the same trend is present in other healthcare systems including the NHS', 'Empirical extensions indicate that mortality rates decrease when male physicians practice with more female colleagues or have treated more female patients in the past', 'Karol Watson, director of the Women’s Cardiovascular Center at the University of California, Los Angeles', '“The key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,” Greenwood said', 'As well as looking at the patients’ age, gender, and whether they had other health problems, the team also looked at whether the patient died during their stay in hospital and whether the emergency room doctor primarily looking after them was a man or a woman', 'Why would women treated by male physicians be dying at a higher rate than those treated by female doctors even though they were admitted to the hospital?', 'Now researchers say the gender of the doctor might affect female patients’ chances of survival']"
"– A new UN analysis finds that at least 60,000 people have died in the Syria conflict, a ""much higher"" number than was expected and one that is ""truly shocking,"" says the UN human rights commissioner. The exhaustive, months-long study compiled data from seven sources to come up with a list of 59,648 names as of November. And because fighting has continued, it's safe to say that number is now above 60,000, Reuters reports. (That's slightly higher than the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.) The last UN estimate, in May, had the death toll at more than 10,000. This new estimate finds that deaths were at 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011, but had risen to more than 5,000 per month by this past summer. And the violence continued today with what may have been one of the worst attacks so far, al-Jazeera reports: Dozens were killed when a Syrian warplane fired a missile at a gas station near Damascus where people were waiting in line to fill up their cars.","[', the Virtual Memorial now extends the healing power and emotional impact of The Wall to millions of more people through the Internet', 'Fighting also broke out around the crucial Wadi Deif base, one of the last regime bastions in the northwest, the Britain-based observatory said, in a fresh bid to wrest control of the strategic post', 'The deadly strikes came as forces loyal to Assad battled rebels with artillery fire in Harasta and Douma, rebel strongholds to the northeast of the capital, and in Daraya to the southwest', 'The rebel assault came after authorities announced the temporary closure of the international airport in Aleppo province on Tuesday, after days of attacks there by the rebels who hold large swathes of territory in northern Syria', 'A local resident told the AFP news agency that the army was carrying out air raids around the Taftanaz base in an attempt to repel the multi-pronged attack', 'The Virtual Memorial features more than 100,000 messages, anecdotes and photographs and provides visitors with the ability to view digital name rubbings similar to those at The Wall in Washington, D', 'Northeast of Damascus, the army shelled Qaboon district, the observatory said, while in the south, residents of a Palestinian refugee camp that faced deadly air raids in December, fled once again amid mortar attacks', ', and will showcase the photos of the more than 58,000 individuals whose names are on The Wall', 'Army reinforcements have been massing for weeks in Daraya in a bid to drive rebel Free Syrian Army fighters from the town, the site of the bloodiest massacre of the conflict in which hundreds died in August', ""For veterans, family, friends and others who are unable to travel to the nation's capital, the site offers an opportunity to remember and honor the more than 58,000 men and women whose names are inscribed on the Memorial"", 'Regime warplanes also bombed the town of Moadamiyet al-Sham, southwest of the capital, killing at least 12 members of the same family, most of them children, the watchdog said', 'Launched on November 10, 1998, The Virtual Memorial is a commemorative website created to extend the legacy of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial', 'The Education Center is being built underground on the National Mall in Washington, D', 'Rebels captured the nearby town of Maaret al-Numan, located on the important Damascus-Aleppo highway, in October', 'Mohammed Saeed, an activist who visited the area, said the missile struck as drivers waited in line with their cars at the station']"
"– The first government shutdown since the Clinton/Gingrich years has some people bemoaning our divided government. And yes, ""separation of powers is inefficient,"" admits Charles CW Cooke at the National Review; ""it will not only 'allow' gridlock, but it is explicitly designed to encourage it."" And that's not a mistake. ""The Constitution is the product of an abiding insight into politics—an insight that does not change with the wind."" This is how the system is supposed to work. Not everyone agrees: Republicans have driven the government past the point of rationality, complains Joe Nocera at the New York Times. ""A government that functioned would fight over the budget, but would ultimately pass a budget. This government can barely hobble from one CR to the next."" Michael Gerson at the Washington Post notes that the Tea Party's most vociferous opponents are now fellow Republicans, and it's gone beyond traditional GOP ideological disputes. ""We are no longer seeing a revolt against Republican leadership,"" he observes. ""This revolt is against anyone who accepts the constraints of political reality."" The man who orchestrated the last shutdown, on the other hand, thinks Democrats are the ones being unreasonable ""When President Barack Obama is willing to negotiate with Russian, Syrian, and Iranian leaders, but unwilling to negotiate with the US House … it is time for the House to stand firm,"" Newt Gingrich writes in a CNN op-ed. If Republicans cave, he argues, Obama will be able to bully them for years to come. Regardless of who's right, Sean Trende at RealClearPolitics thinks that politically, Republicans will suffer but survive. A shutdown will give Democrats ammunition to blame them for the next economic downturn. But their cause is more popular than Gingrich's was.

"– Megyn Kelly's memoir is out next week, and she doesn't appear happy with parts of a review that appears Friday in the New York Times. Kelly took to Twitter to clarify two things: She doesn't think she was poisoned the morning of the first GOP debate, and she doesn't think any questions were leaked to Donald Trump in advance, reports USA Today. Kelly doesn't explicitly state either thing in the book, Settle for More, but Times reviewer Jennifer Senior reads between the lines. For instance, on the leak, Kelly wrote in her memoir that Trump was angry the day before the debate because he'd heard that the first question would be a tough one from Kelly, which turned out to be true—it was about his treatment of women. Reads Senior's review: ""She doesn’t speculate where the leak came from. (She reports. You decide.)"" But the review adds that an ""unambiguous takeaway from this book"" is that then-Fox chief Roger Ailes and others ""seemed to be nakedly colluding with the Republican presidential nominee."" Kelly, though, tweeted that her book ""does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did."" As for the other incident: Kelly wrote in her book that a driver picked her up to take her to the debate and insisted on fetching her coffee, even though she had repeatedly declined; she was violently sick minutes later. ""Ms. Kelly never says outright that someone tried to poison her,"" adds the review. ""But the episode spooked her. ... Foul play? Again: She reports. You decide.""

"– ""Hopefully she can start to mend her relationships and reunite with her children,"" Shannon Smith's lawyer said Wednesday after an Ohio judge granted her early release from prison, where she's serving 10 years for the slaying of her children's father. Smith's 10-year-old son, Bradyn—who saw his mom stab his dad, Robbie Takach, in the chest while Takach held his 15-month-old daughter in 2009—had asked the Warren County judge to keep Smith in jail because ""I am afraid of her."" However, the judge ruled that Smith, convicted of voluntary manslaughter, will be released after serving seven years in December 2016. She will be on house arrest for one year and probation-like community control for three, reports the Washington Post. ""The judge said she needed to be out to be there for her children—but her children are afraid of her,"" the children's paternal grandmother, who is raising them, said after the hearing. She had previously expressed that she thought Bradyn and younger sister Brooklynn would be ""better able to handle the situation"" if their mom was released after the full 10 years, at which point they'd be 15 and 13, respectively. Smith told the judge, ""I'm so very sorry and I hate what I've done. I hate the pain that I've caused so many people,"" reports WLWT.

"– What began as an Ugly Sweater Party has turned into an international incident. The BBC reports Michael Rohana was attending such a party four days before Christmas at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia when he allegedly entered a room that was closed to guests but, per the Guardian, had an unlocked door. Inside were 10 of China's famed 8,000 terracotta warrior statues, on loan from China. Xinhua reports on the FBI's allegations: that the 24-year-old took a selfie with the statues, touched the left hand of one and seemed to break something off it, then left. On Jan. 8, museum staffers discovered the statue he was said to have touched—valued at $4.5 million—was missing a thumb. An investigation led to Rohana and his home in Bear, Del.; he allegedly confessed to having broken off the thumb and placed it in his desk drawer. An FBI affidavit states that a friend claims Rohana also Snapchatted a photo of the finger the day after the party, reports the Courier Post. China is incensed, with the head of the organization that loaned the statues to the US asking ""that the US severely punish the perpetrator. We have lodged a serious protest with them."" Two of the organization's members will travel to the US to see the damage first-hand and make the repair with the now-recovered thumb. China will seek monetary damages. Rohana has been charged with concealment of a major artwork and was released on bail after giving up his passport. (How was the Terracotta Army made?

Though the ABC show wouldn’t confirm the report, an “insider” says “Ryan has wanted to be on the show for years.” Lochte, 32, could use some good PR. Slammed for fabricating a robbery story, Lochte has insisted he only “over-exaggerated” details of the incident in Rio. This week, the 12-time Olympic medalist was dumped by Speedo and Ralph Lauren.

Per WTVR, Clayton Litten was perusing his new bathroom floor from his perch on the porcelain throne when he spotted what he says is a ""one in a trillion"" sighting—a ""perfect"" depiction of the GOP presumptive nominee within the tile's riveting Rorschach, standing with arms folded. ""This cannot be. There's no way,"" Litten tells the station he said when his eyes fell upon this lavatory vision, which he confirmed with workers who were still toiling away on his bathroom remodel. Litten, who's said to be suffering from incurable lung cancer, doesn't leave the house except for doctor visits, and he mainly corresponds with people via email, per the Genorosity.com page set up in his name. He tells WTVR he used that email account to shoot off a pic of the tile to Trump's campaign in the hopes that he might snag a meeting with the candidate when he's in nearby Richmond Friday for a rally. He adds he's a Republican who, tile or no tile, intends to vote for Trump in November (Litten says he hasn't heard back yet). Meanwhile, the station is crowdsourcing opinions about the tile, tweeting an image of Litten's Trump and a poll asking if others see Donald, don't see him, or … see Hillary.

"– The frontman of Darkthrone, a Norwegian ""black metal"" band, has accidentally gotten himself elected to his local town council, Pitchfork reports. As Glyve ""Fenriz"" Nagell explained to Clrvynt last week, ""basically, they called and asked if I wanted to be on the list [of backup representatives]. I said yeah, thinking I would be like 18th on the list and I wouldn’t really have to do anything."" He then took a campaign photo of himself holding his cat, Peanut Butter, with the message, ""Please don't vote for me."" People did not listen. Nagell was indeed elected to be a backup representative in Kolbotn, an Oslo suburb, a role that lasts four years and, he complains, doesn't pay much. ""I'm not too pleased about it,"" he says. ""It's boring."" As for how exactly he got added to the list of candidates in the first place, he says, per FACT, ""They just need a list to be able to … well, it’s hard to talk local politics in another language.""

A sampling of reactions from the Huffington Post, Reuters, the AP, and the Los Angeles Times: John Ramsey, 25, quit his job, donated thousands of dollars to Camping’s Family Radio, and took to the streets of Manhattan with his family to spread word of the coming end of days. Now, he and his mother must find new jobs and his 19-year-old brother, who quit high school, might re-enroll. The good news is, Ramsey’s wife will get to have her baby. “Life goes on,” he says. “I get to be a dad.” Peter Lombardi, 44, who took an “indefinite break” from his job last year, acknowledges that perhaps “no man knows the day or the hour” the world will end. He spent yesterday peeling Judgment Day stickers off his minivan, but says he’s “not disappointed.” He does want an explanation from Camping, to whom he donated money: “I don’t think they were scamming me, but I am definitely waiting to see what they say … on the radio show.” Robert Fitzpatrick, who spent much of his life savings on advertisements for the rapture, stood in Times Square at 6pm and simply said, “I do not understand why … I do not understand why nothing has happened.” He added, ""I can't tell you what I feel right now. Obviously, I haven't understood it correctly because we're still here."" Keith Bauer, 38, loaded his family into his SUV and drove from Maryland to California to await the end of days.

"– A massive fire New Year's Eve in a multi-story parking garage in Liverpool, England, destroyed around 1,400 cars, with one exploding every few seconds at the height of the blaze, authorities say—but no humans or animals were seriously injured. Horses had been stabled in the garage before performances at the Liverpool International Horse Show, but they were moved to safety inside the nearby Echo Arena, the AP reports. Firefighters say six dogs that had been left in cars were rescued, including four from a vehicle on the roof of the seven-story structure and two that were saved from the second floor before the fire took hold, reports the Guardian.

"– Tom Wolfe, author of works including The Right Stuff, the Bonfire of the Vanities, and A Man in Full has died in Manhattan at age 88, reports the New York Times. The cause of death was unclear, but Wolfe had been recently hospitalized for an infection.

An acolyte of French novelist Emile Zola and other authors of ""realistic"" fiction, the stylishly attired Wolfe was an American maverick who insisted that the only way to tell a great story was to go out and report it, per the AP.

McGinniss came to fame at age 26, notes the New York Times, when he published The Selling of the President, his account of Richard Nixon's 1969 campaign. ""McGinniss was an emissary from the New Journalism,"" wrote historian David Greenberg, ""with his countercultural accents, youthful iconoclasm, and nonchalant willingness to bare his left-leaning political views."" McGinniss authored other books and worked as a newspaper columnist, but cemented his legacy with 1983's Fatal Vision, his controversial account of the murders of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald's pregnant wife and two children. McGinniss, who was initially invited to chronicle the trial by MacDonald himself, eventually came to believe MacDonald was guilty and inserted himself blatantly into his own narrative; MacDonald was convicted, but eventually sued McGinniss successfully. In 2011, he authored The Rogue, his very unauthorized biography of Sarah Palin.

"– A body discovered at the home of New York Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins has led to a manslaughter charge for his brother. William Jenkins, released from a New Jersey prison in 2016 after serving time for drug charges, was arrested in New York around 2am Tuesday; he had violated his parole by leaving the state. Eight hours later, authorities received a 911 call and responded to the Fair Lawn home of Janoris Jenkins, 10 miles north of MetLife Stadium, where they found the body of 25-year-old Roosevelt Rene. Described as a family friend and music producer working under the name Trypps Beatz, Rene had been living at the home while the NFLer was in his native Florida, having wrapped up a Giants minicamp two weeks ago, per ESPN and NJ.com. Though authorities asked a neighbor if they'd heard gunshots, per WABC, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reports police are investigating the death as a ""possible strangulation/suffocation."" Rene's body was reportedly found in the basement of the home by a worker, according to TMZ. William Jenkins, who also lived at his brother's home, was charged Wednesday with aggravated manslaughter and is being held at Ontario County Jail in New York.

"– Guardians of the Galaxy—what the AP describes as a ""3-D space opera"" starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper—opens today, and reviewers seem happy. As of this writing, 91% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes approve of the Marvel flick, mainly because it does what a summertime movie inspired by a comic series is supposed to: entertain, excite, and elicit a few laughs. Examples: Peter Travers writes at Rolling Stone that, ""through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the cliches of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun."" He adds that it's ""insanely, shamelessly silly"" and that this is the movie where a ripped Pratt transforms into a ""full-fledged movie star."" Summer and cinema metaphors as over the top as the movie abound. Tom Long writes at the Detroit News that the film ""will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more,"" while David Hiltbrand writes at the Philadelphia Inquirer declares that Guardians ""is an open fire hydrant of a summer movie: more fun than should be allowed in hot weather."" Tom Huddleston writes at Time Out London that the movie is like the ""box of chocolates"" from Forrest Gump: ""A vast, family-sized festive crate of chocolates, all wrapped in the shiniest packaging, all exploding with sweetness and surprises."" Bilge Ebiri offers more of a backhanded compliment, writing at Vulture that the ""very fun"" Guardians ""is the class clown of the Marvel Universe,"" wistfully adding that, ""like most class clowns … you wish it would apply itself, because it seems capable of being so much more."" And then—the naysayers. Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle writes that the movie ""feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it,"" while Kyle Smith at the New York Post calls the movie ""space junk"" and makes the wince-inducing comparison of the film to sci-fi fiascos Howard the Duck and Green Lantern.","['This is all very much to the good, but the problem with ""Guardians of the

"– John Boehner has never looked weaker than he did last night, when Republicans refused to pass Plan B. It ""was hardly the first public humiliation"" Boehner's troops have dealt him, writes Steve Kornacki at Salon, but ""it raises some very basic questions about the House speaker's political future—like whether he even has one."" This is a speaker who doesn't even have the GOP votes to pass his own plan, let alone a compromise Obama would be willing to sign. If Boehner stays on as speaker, he's going to have to get used to passing things with Democratic votes—but that's a pretty big if. As Ezra Klein at the Washington Post points out, Boehner will need an absolute majority to win the Jan. 3 speaker election, which means that even a no-hope conservative challenger could derail him, clearing the way for, say, a consensus candidate like Eric Cantor to come forward.

"– The Carolina Panthers started a new trend called ""Creedbombing,"" which is exactly what it sounds like—surprising someone by loudly singing a Creed song in your best impersonation of Creed's growly lead singer, Scott Stapp—and the team has won Stapp himself as a fan as a result. ""They are my team right now,"" the frontman, normally a Cowboys fan, tells the Charlotte Observer. He adds that he wants to meet the team and maybe even film a Creedbombing video with players. ""The fact that Creed is still in the conversation 20 years later I think speaks for volumes for how the music has impacted people,"" he notes. ""Like, are you serious? This is so cool,"" Stapp said when describing his initial reaction to learning about Creedbombing. ""And I just felt like, hey man, there are Creed fans on the Panthers?"" Well, either that or they're making fun of your band, Scott. But, to be fair, linebacker Ben Jacobs said Creedbombing was born out of a realization that he and other teammates ""still kind of liked the songs"" when he first described Creedbombing to the Observer. ""The key is you’ve got to make really deep, direct eye contact,"" he said. ""So if you Creedbomb someone you’ve got to look them directly in the eye.""

"– The nuclear deal struck with Iran last night is either ""a triumph,"" or something we shouldn't be all that excited about just yet. Dueling columnists weigh in: Guess what: The deal is exactly what President Obama was going for, an agreement that—when details were leaked a few weeks ago—no one thought Iran would agree to, writes Fred Kaplan at Slate. The interim agreement requires Iran to stop enriching uranium above 5%, freeze the stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.5%, neutralize the stockpile enriched to 20% so it cannot be used for weapons, halt work on centrifuges and enrichment facilities, permit more and better inspections, and more. ""The agreement makes it impossible for the Iranians to make any further progress toward making a nuclear weapon in the next six months—and, if the talks break down after that, and the Iranians decide at that point to start building a nuclear arsenal, it will take them much longer to do so."" Kaplan calls it ""a triumph,"" adding that only a very small percentage of the sanctions on Iran will be freed up in exchange. It's a first step ""rife with historic possibilities.""  On Politico, Aaron David Miller takes a more wary approach. Yes, this deal could end up being a ""historic"" part of US-Iran relations, but ""we should be careful about putting on the party hats and breaking out the champagne—at least for now, anyway."" He lays out five reasons why. Among them: Israel isn't happy with the deal, which could make for ""a diplomatic trainwreck."" But perhaps the most serious problem: In Miller's opinion, the deal doesn't go far enough to put the brakes on Iran's nuclear program (it should have ""limit[ed] centrifuges and [sought] ironclad assurances that Iran can’t reconvert its enriched uranium stockpile into useable material""), meaning we must consider the consequences if a comprehensive accord is not reached within the six-month limit—which it likely won't be. ""We need to be honest with ourselves about what’s achievable.""","['Without going into a lot of technical detail (which can be read here), the point is this: The agreement makes it impossible for the Iranians to make any further progress toward making a nuclear weapon in the next six months—and, if the talks break down after that, and the Iranians decide at that point to start building a nuclear arsenal, it will take them much longer to do so', 'The advocates of cutting a deal with Iran, including smart and cool heads in Israel, are right that the best you might be able to do is to put more time back on the Iranian nuclear program’s clock so that the world will have enough warning to detect and deal with an effort to break out and weaponize', 'Part of this flows from the conviction of those inside who know how hard it is to get anything done in negotiations; and part from the logic that you need to compare the accord not to the perfect but to the alternative: Iran’s continued effort to acquire a breakout capacity', 'But what if the six-month period ends without a comprehensive accord? The logic behind a comprehernsive deal is that Iran will get hooked on a reinvigorated economy—popular pressures will grow as jobs are created, goods become available and the leadership sees the advantage of more and more sanctions relief', 'But reaching a sweeping agreement with Iran that puts to rest any prospect of the reconstitution of its nuclear program in exchange for removal of the toughest sanctions, on banking and oil, seems right now a fantastical proposition', '24, 2013: The article originally stated that it took the U', 'And even if Iran fudges some aspects of the deal, there will be great pressure and temptation to try to work things out even at the risk of not strictly enforcing the agreement', 'It’s time for all the critics to take a deep breath, read the terms of the agreement, recognize that the deal goes way beyond what anybody could reasonably have hoped for, and give this thing a chance', 'On the Iranian side, their hard-liners must be gulping at even this interim agreement, hoping that the unfreezing of assets will provide enough economic relief to make the nuclear cutbacks worthwhile', 'Here’s the thing: The deal just signed by Iran and the P5+1 nations (the United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China plus Germany) is precisely the hoped-for deal laid out at that briefing', 'How much further they’re willing to cut without the total lifting of Western sanctions—and how far the West is willing to lift sanctions without the total dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear programs—is unknown', 'Certainly the NPT allows them the right to develop “peaceful nuclear energy”—that is, to have some form of a nuclear program', 'That the four other permanent members of the U', 'The next phase—the more comprehensive agreement that the parties will try to negotiate over the next six months—will be a much harder nut', 'Yet this deal goes way beyond any arms-control accord that the United States and the Soviet Union struck in the first 18 years of détente', 'and the USSR a ""quarter-century"" to reach any arms-control deals during détente', '5 percent; neutralize its stockpile of uranium that’s been enriched to 20 percent (either by diluting it to 5 percent purity or converting it to a form that cannot be used to make a weapon); stop producing, installing, or modernizing centrifuges; stop constructing more enrichment facilities; halt all activities at the Arak nuclear reactor (which has the potential to produce nuclear weapons made of plutonium); permit much wider and more intrusive measures of verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency, including daily inspections of all facilities', 'If it imposes them anyway, they must know that this agreement—and the international coalition holding the sanctions in place—will collapse', 'Meanwhile, Iran has to do the following things: halt the enrichment of all uranium above 5 percent and freeze the stockpile of uranium enriched to 3', 'Even if the mullahs of Iran vanished tomorrow and were replaced by secular democrats, these new rulers would continue to demand what they see as the right to enrich uranium to some degree', 'But if the next phase—the comprehensive accord—falls apart, it will be harder for the P5+1 nations to reimpose sanctions', 'The second reason for resistance, and a more serious political problem, is that some people (including the Israeli president, many American neoconservatives, and lots of Sunni Arabs) are worried, above all, that this agreement might work', 'This amounts to a very small percentage of the sanctions imposed on Iran’s energy and financial sectors', 'Iran has come too far in its nuclear program for the United States and Israel ever to have that kind of certainty or finality', 'And because there will be a need to pacify Iran’s own hardliners, nasty anti-Israeli statements of the kind the supreme leader made last week, when he described Israel as a “rabid dog,” are likely to continue', 'The U', 'And if a détente-of-sorts evolves from these talks, if it becomes possible for the United States and Iran to discuss, then maybe act upon, issues of mutual interest, then that is certainly in our interest, whatever anybody else thinks', 'The follow-on accord will, presumably, require Iran to dismantle more of its nuclear program—and require the West to start lifting its more crippling sanctions', 'The recently concluded interim agreement may be problematic because it doesn’t put a brake on some of the most troubling aspects on Iran’s nuclear program, particularly limiting centrifuges and seeking ironclad assurances that Iran can’t reconvert its enriched uranium stockpile into usable material', 'The Sunnis fear that doing so might tilt the regional balance of power against them and toward the Shiites']"
"– Eyes now automatically turn to Twitter after anyone criticizes Donald Trump, and Meryl Streep's dig at the president-elect during Sunday's Golden Globes did indeed elicit a Trump response. Streep used her time onstage while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award to talk about when she first saw Trump mock a disabled reporter at a 2015 rally. ""It kind of broke my heart,"" she noted, berating the ""instinct to humiliate"" that he seemed to display. The New York Times first got hold of Trump right after the awards—it was Times reporter Serge Kovaleski whom Trump reportedly made fun of—and although he said he hadn't seen Streep's speech, he noted he ""wasn't surprised"" about coming under fire from ""liberal movie people."" ""People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter's disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing,"" he said, adding he'd simply been ""calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story."" He reiterated his stance early Monday with a three-tweet defense. ""Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a … Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never 'mocked' a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him … 'groveling' when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad.

"– An interpreter broke down crying yesterday when he relayed a message from a Holocaust survivor to the Polish man whose family hid him in their attic during World War II—a man he had not seen for almost 70 years.

The only reason we are alive is because of you and your family,"" Leon Gersten, 79, told Czeslaw Polziec, 81, both of them fighting against tears of their own.

They'll celebrate Thanksgiving and Hanukkah together, CNN reports. Gersten, now a Long Island psychologist, was sheltered by Polziec's Catholic family for two years along with other family members including his mother, sister, and his brother-in-law's family. ""These generations are growing up"" because of the Polziec family, Gersten said, gesturing to his extended family. The Polziecs did not know the Gerstens before the family showed up at their farm seeking shelter, but they went so far as to build an underground bunker, just in case the Gerstens needed to hide there. Polziec's father was even once beaten by suspicious Nazis, the New York Post reports. But the Gerstens ""were honest people who just wanted to do the right thing,"" said Polziec when asked why his parents took them in.

"– The timing of energy tycoon Aubrey McClendon's death raised suspicions, but police say they've found no connection between the fiery car crash he died in and the fact that the former Chesapeake Energy CEO had been indicted just a day earlier for alleged bid-rigging, reports the Wall Street Journal. McClendon, part owner of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was speeding and not wearing a seatbelt when he slammed into a bridge in Oklahoma City on March 2. The 56-year-old fracking pioneer, who had a wife and three children, faced up to 10 years in federal prison and a $1 million fine if found guilty of conspiring to rig bids for oil and gas leases in Oklahoma.

"– The wave of the future for some German government communications could be a decidedly retro one. It's no secret that the country is unhappy with NSA and other spying on the country, and in a TV interview Monday, the politician heading up parliament's probe into NSA doings in the country revealed that his NSA committee is seriously considering using typewriters. ""And not electronic models either."" The interviewer seemed not to expect that revelation, notes the Guardian, asking, ""Really?"" Replied Patrick Sensburg, ""Yes, no joke."" Some of Germany's politicians do see it as a joke, however. Says the SPD's representative on the committee, ""This call for mechanical typewriters is making our work sound ridiculous.

"– Before its battery petered out, the small spacecraft that landed on a moving comet managed to detect organic molecules on the comet, reports NBC News. An instrument aboard the Philae lander essentially sniffed the atmosphere and found evidence of the molecules, which, as the Wall Street Journal explains, are the ""rudimentary building blocks of life."" It might shed further light on the theory that a comet or comets smacked into a young Earth and delivered the materials necessary for life. While the discovery isn't a huge surprise, it could prove especially interesting if the molecules are complex ones such as amino acids rather than simple ones such as methane, observes the Journal. Further study is needed to figure out what kind of molecules were found, but it looks like scientists won't be getting any help from soil analysis. The lander drilled below the comet's surface to retrieve a frozen sample, which was to be analyzed in the lander's oven, but it now looks like no sample ever made it into the oven, reports the BBC. As scientists pore over data that the lander managed to send before going dark, they continue to hold out hope that the craft, which is equipped with solar panels, will wake up in the coming months as the comet moves closer to the sun. As for the newly discovered organic molecules, ""they could hold a key to early life on Earth,"" writes Sarah Zhang at Gizmodo. ""This is a big reason we sent Rosetta all the way to a lonely comet in the first place.

"– An Italian actor has been declared dead after a hanging scene apparently went horribly wrong. Raphael Schumacher, 27, was taking part in a live theater performance of ""Mirages"" at the Teatro Lux in Pisa, Italy, last Saturday when a spectator found him unconscious. The Washington Post reports the play was viewed in sections in different parts of the theater with audience members moving between scenes. A single spectator watched in a courtyard as Schumacher recited a monologue about the angst of a 15-year-old boy, stepped on a cube, and placed his head in a noose hanging from a fig tree, reports Il Tirreno. A medical school graduate—it isn't clear if she was the original spectator—then saw Schumacher's body twitching and rushed to help, reports ANSA News. Schumacher—who never regained consciousness and was declared brain-dead at a local hospital on Thursday, per the BBC—changed the original ending of the scene, which was supposed to involve a gun, says a Teatro Lux manager. ""Raphael changed it without telling us."" But a prosecutor says the scene ""was performed successfully earlier on Saturday evening, when he ended the scene laying his head in the noose."" Schumacher's family members don't believe it was suicide. ""His father died recently and he had just broken up with someone, but he had soon regained inner peace,"" his mom says.

"– A pair of British hikers looking for adventure in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been freed after being kidnapped, but a 25-year-old park ranger is dead. British authorities said Sunday that Bethan Davies and Robert Jesty had been freed after gunmen ambushed their vehicle in Virunga National Park on Friday, reports the BBC. During the ambush, the gunmen killed Rachel Masika Baraka, who was one of 26 female rangers at the park. She is believed to be the first female ranger killed at Virunga, which Reuters explains is located in a still-volatile region near Uganda and Rwanda but remains a draw for tourists worldwide because of its endangered mountain gorillas and active volcano. She is the eighth park ranger overall killed in this year alone. The details of how the hostages were freed remain murky, but ransom negotiations had been underway. The gunmen took the British pair on foot, along with their driver, who was eventually freed before the Brits. ""One of them said to me ‘I will leave you here, if (they) find you, tell them we need $200,000 and if they keep on chasing us, we will kill these two,'"" the injured driver tells the Telegraph. The kidnappers later reduced their demand to $30,000, according to another story in the Telegraph.

"– That Tylenol you just popped may do the trick when it comes to dulling your headache. But a new University of Toronto study finds that the painkiller's active ingredient, acetaminophen, may also put a damper on your ability to notice errors, Science Daily reports. ""The core idea of our study is that we don't fully understand how acetaminophen affects the brain,"" researcher Dan Randles says. To get a clearer picture, the team put together two teams of 30 participants each and had them play ""Go or No Go,"" in which they hit a Go button when the letter F flashed on a screen and do nothing when the letter E appeared. The subjects, half of whom had taken 1,000mg of acetaminophen, were hooked up to an EEG to measure brain activity. The group that had taken the equivalent of a normal maximum dose of the painkiller hit the Go button more often when E flashed on the screen, according to UPI. Also, they failed to push the button when the F appeared more often than those on the placebo group. ""It looks like acetaminophen makes it harder to recognize an error,"" Randles says. Next on the agenda for the researchers: to study whether acetaminophen causes people to ""mind wander,"" and to answer the question of whether the drug, in addition to inhibiting the ability to detect errors, also contributes to people making more mistakes. Past research has suggested that acetaminophen may reduce the pain of social rejection, ""sort of like alcohol or Xanax,"" the Atlantic reported in 2013. Another study shows that the drug alters the way people pass moral judgment.

"– A badly doctored propaganda photo has made hapless officials in China's Huili county the laughing stock of a nation of 1.3 billion people. The photo on the rural county's website appeared to show county officials levitating above the road project they were inspecting, the Guardian reports. The county apologized and pulled the photo—but not before it had spread through countless blogs and chatrooms. Chinese Internet users came up with a flood of parodies, showing the officials on the moon, at a soccer game, surrounded by dinosaurs, or joined by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.

"– When President Obama meets with Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House today, he’ll probably pressure the Israeli PM to stop illegal construction in the West Bank. But even as the administration fights those settlements, the US government is giving millions in tax breaks to groups that help build them, the New York Times reports. At least 40 US groups have collected more than $200 million in tax-exempt donations to use specifically for Israeli settlements. Senior State Department officials call the donations “a problem,” saying they undermine administration policy. “It drove us crazy,” says a Bush-era ambassador to Israel. But “it was a thing you didn’t talk about in polite company.” Israel itself stopped offering such tax breaks in 1995. But in the US, paperwork requirements are so scant that groups pretty much do as they please; the Times found some with expenditures that looked suspiciously like illegal real estate purchases or

"– A long-running California lawsuit has concluded with three paint companies being ordered to pay $1.1 billion to remove lead paint in 10 cities and counties. The judge ruled that the companies had created a ""public nuisance"" by selling the toxic paint for decades before it was banned in 1978, the Los Angeles Times reports. Some 5 million homes in the cities and counties that sued, mainly in low-income neighborhoods, may still contain enough lead paint to pose a health risk. Childhood exposure to lead has been linked to learning disabilities, other health problems, and even adult criminality. But the paint companies say they sold the lead paint in good faith before the ban and have vowed to fight the ruling, the AP reports. ""The decision rewards scofflaw landlords who are responsible for the risk to children from poorly maintained lead paint, and it conflicts with and threatens to upend California's lead poisoning prevention programs, which work,"" a spokeswoman for the companies says. ""This decision is more likely to hurt children than help them, and it will likely disrupt the sale, rental, and market value of all homes and apartments built before 1978.""","['""It does not change the fact that lead paint is the primary source of lead poisoning for children in the jurisdictions who live in pre-1978 housing', 'Some 60,000 children under the age of 6 suffered from lead poisoning between 2007 and 2010 alone in the jurisdictions who filed the lawsuit, the judge noted', 'The government’s case stressed that lead paint is widely considered to be the main cause of lead poisoning for children who live in older housing', '""The decision rewards scofflaw landlords who are responsible for the risk to children from poorly maintained lead paint, and it conflicts with and threatens to upend California\'s lead poisoning prevention programs, which work,"" Campbell said', 'The opinion set aside $605 million, or 55% of the judgment, to pay for lead removal in Los Angeles County', 'The companies, however, argued that they never deliberately sold a hazardous product and relied on experts that did not determine the levels of lead in their paints were a public health problem until they were taken off the market in the 1970s', 'Bonnie Campbell, a spokeswoman for the companies, said the paint manufacturers will urge the judge to overturn his decision', 'The money will go into a fund administered by the state’s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch and will pay for inspections and lead abatement on the inside walls of tens of thousands of homes', '“The court is convinced there are thousands of California children in the Jurisdictions whose lives can be improved, if not saved through a lead abatement plan,” the judge’s ruling said', 'Data from the 2010 census show that close to 5 million homes at issue in the lawsuit were built before lead paint was banned in 1978', 'The companies have 15 days to object to the tentative ruling, which the judge can alter', 'Campbell said the verdict unfairly penalizes companies for marketing lead-based paint in good faith before the health risks were known', 'Nearly 5 million homes in the cities and counties that sued were built before the 1978 ban and could require abatement', 'It alleges the manufacturers knew of lead-paint dangers starting in the 1890s but still sold it to consumers without health warnings', '""The defendants sold lead paint with actual and constructive knowledge that it was harmful', 'The 10 cities and counties awarded damages Monday are the counties of Santa Clara, Alameda, Los Angeles, Monterey, San Mateo, Solano and Ventura, and the cities of Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco', 'She said the current owners of pre-1978 painted homes should be responsible for removing the lead', 'The case has taken 13 years to reach trial because of objections from the industry, but appeals courts have allowed it to proceed', 'The case went to trial in July']"
"– It's less killer whale and more killed whales, at least according to a new study that found at least half the world's orcas could be taken down by ocean pollution in just a few decades. The culprit: highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. ""Despite a near-global ban of PCBs more than 30 years ago, the world's killer whales illustrate the troubling persistence of this chemical class,"" reads the study in Science. Most PCBs, which were used in everything from plastics to paint, have not been destroyed or securely stored, reports the BBC, and those that already leached into the ocean are unrecoverable and stubbornly persist in the whales, who metabolize them incredibly slowly, reports the New York Times. PCB concentration rises as you climb the food chain. Killer whales are at the top, leaving them with levels than can be 100 times what's considered safe and making them ""the most contaminated animals on the planet,"" as the Guardian puts it. Newborn calves are heavily dosed with PCBs via milk, and even birthing newborns may be compromised: Science Daily reports researchers evaluated the PCB levels of more than 350 orcas and detected PCB levels of 1300 milligrams per kilo in some whales' blubber; other studies have shown animals with levels of just 50 milligrams can exhibit infertility and immune system issues. The most contaminated, and therefore threatened, populations are those near Brazil, the UK, and the Strait of Gibraltar.

"– Ever stop and think the planet would be a better place if humans weren't around? Les U. Knight came to that conclusion long ago, and unlike you, he's doing something about it. He's the founder of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, which aims to rid Earth of humans. Sounds like a depressing goal, right? Well, VHEMT (say it as ""vehement"") is actually pretty upbeat about the whole thing. To clarify, the organization's website notes it doesn't advocate for suicide, it's not a suicide cult, and yes, it likes babies. But it also states that the annihilation of humans would give Earth a chance to recover. This idea isn't exactly new: The Awl points to an overpopulation-minded essay published in 1798. But as the Awl puts it, VHEMT is ""the only serious organization committed to peacefully annihilating all of humanity."" As its unofficial motto goes, ""May we live long and die out."" Knight—who had a vasectomy at 25, per Big Issue—started the group in 1991 and gained supporters with the zine These Exit Times, which included essays and comics, and, once, a Valentine's Day contest to win a free vasectomy. Those who are fully on board are known as ""volunteers,"" though all they had to do to ""join"" was ""make the choice to refrain from further reproduction."" Writing for the Awl, Joe Veix sees a problem: ""If we are to assume that humans are so selfish/destructive that the earth is better off without us, it also holds that we're too selfish/destructive to ever actually allow ourselves to die off."" Knight offers this counterpoint: ""We're spreading memes, not genes, so the more people who learn of VHEMT, whether they agree or not, it's a success,"" he says. ""I'd like to think there are more than a few people who don't exist thanks to our encouragement.""

"– A Papa John's owner tried to make a buck off his employees' backs, and now he's paying big time. Abdul Jamil Khokhar, who owns nine of the chain's restaurants in the NYC area along with BMY Foods, has pleaded guilty to not paying the correct minimum wage when workers put in overtime, Fortune reports. He and BMY were also accused of filing false business records to make it appear as if other (i.e., fake) employees were actually working those extra hours so he wouldn't get nabbed for not paying the overtime, per a press release. The AP notes that about 300 current and ex-employees were affected.

And when workers put in more than 40 hours per week, they're supposed to be paid time-and-a-half. But, along with co-owner BMY Foods, Khokhar tried to game the system, paying his workers just their regular wages for overtime hours, then concocting ghost workers and filing fraudulent tax returns when he realized the US Labor Department was investigating him, the press release notes. A civil sentence laid out in July mandated that Khokhar cough up $230,000 in back pay for his workers, as well as $230,000 in damages and $50,000 in penalties, Consumerist notes.

Tillerson called Iran ""the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism"" and accused it of ""intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining US interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon,"" the BBC reports.

"– Columbia senior Emma Sulkowicz says school authorities have ignored her allegations that a fellow student raped her in her dorm room on the first day of sophomore year.

"– Just when you thought the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 couldn't get any more mystifying, it has. While searching for the Boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board after departing Kuala Lumpur in March 2014, a ship itself disappeared more than 1,200 miles off Western Australia, reports the Guardian. Ten days into a 90-day search commissioned by Malaysia—which will pay up to $70 million if the ship is found—the Seabed Constructor from US-based company Ocean Infinity apparently turned off its satellite monitoring system Thursday, leaving it untrackable in the Indian Ocean. It reappeared three days later en route to a scheduled refueling stop in Fremantle, Australia, but neither Ocean Infinity or the Malaysian government have offered an explanation for the disappearance, which has sparked wild conspiracy theories. Some speculated that the crew was actually pulling treasure from a Peruvian shipwreck nearby, per News.com.au. With Malaysian officials saying only that Flight 370 wasn't found during the first week of the search that began Jan. 22, others say the Seabed Constructor might've found an area of interest and turned off its Automatic Identification System to protect passengers' relatives from undue distress at seeing the ship focused on a particular spot. The wide-ranging speculation is perhaps no surprise given this search was ""shrouded in mystery"" from the outset of the deal signed in January after months of negotiations, reports New York. An interesting tidbit the magazine uncovered: ""A so-called anchor-handling vessel designed to support offshore oil drilling"" was seen heading for a rendezvous with the Seabed Constructor days before

have ended up in a 25,000-square-kilometer area to the north of the completed search area', 'The ship arrived in the search zone on Sunday, and, given the rate at which the vessel’s swarm of eight

"– ""It started with a dumb decision,"" says Amber VanHecke, a 24-year-old Texas college student who spent five days of her spring break lost near the Grand Canyon. After a day of hiking last week, VanHecke stopped for gas but didn't want to fill up for $2.70 per gallon because she thought it was too expensive, she tells Fox 4. She put only a small amount of gas in her tank and drove on, taking a rough road as instructed by her GPS, reports ABC News. But 20 miles from civilization, her car sputtered to a stop, leaving her without a cell signal. ""That was the first moment I felt true panic,"" VanHecke says. But ""I just wasn't going to give up."" While bad judgment got her stuck, rescuer Jonah Nieves says the former Girl Scout ""did everything right"" from that point on, per the Arizona Republic. Rationing her 34 bottles of water and snacks, including ramen she cooked on her dashboard, VanHecke made a ""help"" sign with rocks and stayed with her car, which allowed her to keep her cellphone charged. On March 17, she went in search of a cell signal, which she found 11 miles away. Her call to 911 cut out after 43 seconds, but it was enough time for dispatchers to pick up her general location. Rescuers arrived at her car in a helicopter soon after and found a note she'd left saying she’d gone down the road, which is exactly where they found her crying ""tears of joy,"" Nieves says.

"– It is now officially the future: Hoverboards are real. A company called Arx Pax has developed a skateboard-style device that rides on air instead of wheels, and it's raising money to ""perfect"" the project on Kickstarter, Phys.org reports. Arx Pax has already surpassed its $250,000 goal. How it works: Four engines on the board create a magnetic field which ""literally pushes against itself,"" the company says on Kickstarter. That pushes the board upward. Says co-inventor Greg Henderson of his Hendo Hoverboard: ""The wheel may finally have some competition."" Pretty cool, but it's not quite a Marty McFly experience yet, Engadget notes: It only gets about an inch off the ground, and it only works over certain types of metal, including copper and aluminum. It's also very loud, according to the Verge (via Gizmodo). Still, it can hold a 300-pound person, Arx Pax says, though the New York Times adds that the board itself weighs 100 pounds. The paper notes that the Hendo Hoverboard ""is basically a publicity stunt.""

"– Syrian regime tanks swept into a Damascus suburb yesterday, killing 25 people and wounding 200 more, opposition activists said today. Government forces met with little resistance there, Reuters reports; rebels had already cleared out of the town. Damascus isn't getting as much press as Aleppo, but it's become an epicenter of violence in Syria, the Washington Post reports. Rebels typically flee in the face of Syrian troop advances, but their departure is followed by the slaughter of civilians in their wake.

"– A 19-year-old college student in Michigan has died after accidentally coming into contact with peanut butter at a friend's apartment on Nov. 19. The Oakland Press reports that Chandler Swink was diagnosed at age two with the most severe level of nut allergy—level six. Someone at the apartment had made peanut butter cookies, and Swink's mother says the Oakland University sophomore either ate food that had somehow touched the cookies or was touched by someone who had peanut butter residue on his hands. Chandler, who hoped to become a nurse, injected himself with an EpiPen and then drove himself to St. Joseph Mercy Oakland where he was found, unconscious, in the parking lot around 1am. He was in a coma for a week, with doctors giving him a 2% chance of survival. The university's paper reports he died at 8:45pm yesterday; it previously reported that his family had been wrestling over whether to take him off life support. Mom Nancy says Swink was bullied throughout his childhood for his allergy, which was so severe his school district went peanut-free for him, much to the displeasure of many. ""When he went to college, he was the happiest kid because he was no longer labeled,"" she says.

"– President Obama has unveiled his fiscal 2016 budget, and it's not likely to receive a warm welcome from Republicans, Reuters reports. The $3.99 trillion plan for the budget year that begins Oct. 1 is founded on higher taxes both for the wealthy and corporations; some money will come from closing loopholes, USA Today reports. The budget aims ""to bring middle-class economics into the 21st century,"" the White House says. Among its key points: That $3.99 trillion in spending meets with projected revenues of $3.53 trillion, for a deficit of $474 billion, or 2.5% of GDP. The AP reports the plan doesn't zero out the deficit over the next decade, but the administration maintains that various actions on health care, immigration, and taxes would trim the deficits by about $1.8 trillion over that period, leaving the red ink at manageable levels. Indeed, the goal is a ""sustainable"" deficit below 3% of GDP, Politico reports. Companies like General Electric and Microsoft would face a one-time 14% tax on what's thought to be $2.1 trillion in profits ""piled up abroad,"" Reuters reports; firms would owe 19% on foreign profits in the future. Sequestration spending ceilings would end, USA Today reports, and domestic and military spending would climb by 7%, with infrastructure and education seeing benefits. Some $3 billion would go to science and math education. The bill would also cover two years' tuition for some community college students at a cost of $60 billion over 10 years. Also put forward: an up-to-$3,000 child care tax credit. The plan also puts forward $14 billion for upping cybersecurity, proposes paid-leave programs, and calls for $1 billion put toward a ""fully democratic"" Central America. Though much of the plan will be distasteful to Republicans, Obama has included significant boosts for GOP priorities like defense, Politico reports, calling the bill an ""opening bid in a long hostage

"– A black counterprotester at August's white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., who was shown being beaten in a viral video, is now facing his own troubles with the law. The Daily Progress reports an arrest warrant has been issued for 20-year-old DeAndre Harris for his alleged attack on an unnamed victim who says it happened shortly before Harris' own beating in a parking garage on Aug. 12. Per WVIR, a Charlottesville Police Department release notes that the victim went to the local magistrate's office to detail the attack allegedly carried out by Harris and to request a warrant. After a detective ""verified"" those facts, a warrant against Harris for unlawful wounding, a felony, was issued. Harris was not yet in custody as of the PD's statement. S. Lee Merritt, one of Harris' attorneys, tells the Washington Post the warrant is ""clearly retaliatory"" and also ""highly unusual"" in that it was issued by a magistrate, not the cops. ""We find it highly offensive and upsetting, but what's more jarring is that he's been charged with the same crime as the men who attacked him,"" Merritt adds. NBC News notes that Merritt started a fundraiser in September for Harris, which has brought in close to $45,000 to help identify and bring to justice his attackers. Two men have already been arrested in that case: Alex Michael Ramos, 33, of Georgia, and Ohio's Daniel Patrick Borden, 18, both charged with malicious wounding. Meanwhile, Zach Roberts, a journalist who took photos of Harris' beating, tweeted that neither Charlottesville cops nor the FBI have had any interest in interviewing him on what he saw that day as a witness, per the Root.","['“They were beating that nigger on the ground!

"– Ukraine's prime minister yesterday said Crimea would remain part of Ukraine, but Crimea itself isn't exactly on board.

The Crimean parliament voted 78-0 (with eight abstentions) ""to enter into the Russian Federation with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation,"" reports Reuters, which cites diplomats as saying today's developments could not have occurred without the OK of Vladimir Putin.

"– Megyn Kelly's deeply controversial interview with Alex Jones aired Sunday night—and although a sizable chunk of her Sunday Night segment on Jones and his Infowars media operation was devoted to explaining why NBC would give airtime to a man who has claimed the Sandy Hook mass shooting was a hoax, some critics were unconvinced. ""Here's the thing, Alex Jones isn't going away,"" Kelly said, who noted that praise for President Trump has helped expand the conspiracy theorist's influence. Jones leaked audio of his conversations with Kelly days before the broadcast. A roundup of coverage: Jones failed to provide a straight answer when Kelly, who said she would deal with his ""notorious lie,"" pressed him on his Sandy Hook claims, the AP reports. He claimed to have been playing ""devil's advocate"" when he said the shootings were faked, but also said there was ""cover-up and manipulation"" surrounding the massacre and some of the footage ""looks like a drill."" The light that Kelly promised to shine on Jones turned out to be a ""dim bulb at best,"" according to Lorraine Ali at the Los Angeles Times. She says Kelly asked tough questions but failed to push for answers, noting that when Kelly asked Jones about his claim that the people killed in the concert attack in Manchester last month were ""liberal trendies,"" Jones delivered a ""senseless word salad of an answer"" that Kelly failed to follow up. Jack Shafer at Politico disagrees, saying Kelly gave Jones a ""pantsing,"" taking him apart in a ""textbook manner."" ""Short of waterboarding him, I don’t know what more Kelly could have done to expose Jones’ dark methods,"" he writes, adding that despite outrage over the interview, dealing straight-on with people like Jones is more effective than pretending he doesn't exist. Kelly was ""out of her league"" in the interview, according to Don Kaplan at the New York Daily News. ""Sure, she looked tough as she grilled Jones, but Kelly delivered no news,"" he writes. ""She did not move the story of this monster forward, nor provide anything aside from a shallow profile of a frightening, sweaty, tin-foil-hat-wearing nutjob.""

"– A Syrian military prison that Amnesty International last year called a ""human slaughterhouse"" is reported to be executing upward of 50 prisoners daily, and now a US State Department official says President Bashar al-Assad's regime has built and is using a secret crematorium to dispose of the bodies, Reuters and the Washington Post report. Stuart Jones, the acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, puts the number of Syrians who have been rounded up, detained, and ""exterminated"" at the Sednaya prison outside of Damascus in the thousands, and the killings appear to have ""unconditional support"" from both Russia and Iran. Jones, who offered overhead photos of the reported crematorium, said evidence was culled from ""intelligence assessments,"" as well as human rights and other sources. Based on the Amnesty International report, the prisoners are apparently yanked from their cells in the middle of the night, ostensibly to be placed in different cells, then summarily hanged or otherwise killed en masse, per CNN. Jones indicated that while Russia and Iran may not have known specifically about the crematorium, they've certainly been aware of other atrocities said to be taking place, ABC News notes.

"– It's long been speculated that James Hewitt, the former British cavalry officer who had an affair with Princess Diana, is Prince Harry's real father—and a controversial new play is set to bring those rumors back to the forefront. Truth, Lies, Diana, opening in London's West End on Jan. 9 after a run in New York, features the Hewitt character telling a journalist, ""Diana and I started our relationship more than a year before Harry was born. Now, that doesn't prove that I am his father. It's just the inconvenient truth."" According to the Telegraph, playwright Jon Conway says Hewitt really did admit his relationship with Di started 18 months prior to Harry's birth and allowed the play to use this information, during two years of interviews with Conway. Hewitt has also confirmed he was interviewed and said he thinks the play is ""accurate,"" but he says he's never read the script. In the past, however, he's staunchly denied fathering Harry and said he didn't even meet Diana until Harry was a toddler. One more royal rumor, plus one fact: A new book called Backstairs Billy, about a servant to the queen mother, claims she adored him ""mostly because he made her gin and tonics just the way she liked them, nine-tenths gin and one-tenth tonic."" (The book also claims that during the last two decades of her life, ""she was dotty to the point of lunacy."") Hilariously, the queen mother's niece and former lady-in-waiting's rebuttal to the ""disgusting"" rumors, as offered to the Express, includes this line: The queen mother ""never drank a gin and tonic, not ever. ... She preferred a gin martini mix, which she usually made herself."" Sir James Dyson, the billionaire vacuum inventor, has now surpassed the queen in English land ownership.

"– A brother of the fugitive Tunisian suspected in Berlin's deadly Christmas market attack is urging Anis Amri to turn himself in to police. Amri's family members, speaking from his hometown of Oueslatia in central Tunisia, were shaken to learn he's the prime suspect in Monday's truck attack, which killed 12. Amri, who turned 24 on Thursday, left Tunisia years ago for Europe but had been in regular contact with his brothers via Facebook and phone. ""I ask him to turn himself into the police,"" brother Abdelkader Amri tells the AP. ""If it is proved that he is involved, we dissociate ourselves from it."" He says his brother may have been radicalized in prison in Italy, where he went after leaving Tunisia in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings. In other developments: German media reported several locations were searched overnight, including a house in Dortmund and a refugee home in Emmerich on the Dutch border. Federal prosecutors, who are leading the investigation, declined to comment. The manhunt also prompted police in Denmark to search a Sweden-bound ferry in the port of Grenaa after receiving tips that someone resembling Amri had been spotted. But police said they found nothing indicating his presence. German officials had deemed Amri, who arrived in the country last year, a potential threat long before the attack. They had been trying to deport him after his asylum application was rejected, and politicians are now bickering over what conclusions should be drawn. The Berlin market that was attacked has reopened. Concrete blocks have been put in place at the roadside to heighten security. Organizers decided to reopen the market next to the central Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on Thursday, though without party music or bright lighting. Berliners and visitors have laid candles and flowers at the site in tribute. Israel Foreign Ministry rep Emmanuel Nahshon said Thursday that citizen Dalia Elyakim was among those killed in the attack. Elyakim was visiting Berlin with her husband Rami and had been missing since the attack. Her husband was seriously wounded but is now stable. The couple, in their 60s, loved to travel, friends say. Donald Trump, when asked Wednesday if the attack in Berlin would cause him to evaluate the proposed ban or a possible registry of Muslims in the United States, said ""You know my plans.

"– If Kim Jong Un's New Year's Day speech managed to warm South Korea, his stylist might deserve the praise. Kim chose to forego his usual navy and black suits and appeared in front of TV cameras in a light grey jacket and tie. The look—including rimmed glasses and slick hair cut above the ears—was more modern than usual for the North Korean leader, who spoke of melting ""frozen North-South relations."" But it was probably a political, rather than a personal, choice. With the New York Times noting South Korea is ""known for its attention to outward appearances,"" Reuters reports the look ""was likely carefully calculated to project a softer, more relaxed image to go with his surprise offer for talks with Seoul."" ""The change from the previous dark Maoist suits to a softer toned grey Western-style suit likely aimed to underpin peace,"" says the South Korean-run Korea Institute for National Unification. A leadership and image consultant adds that clients in less-than-ideal situations are often advised to wear grey or white in an attempt to deflect negative attention. Kim's speaking style might've also helped his message. Once a shaky talker, Kim spoke clearly, barely looking at his notes, per Reuters. It was a showing of confidence perhaps derived from what analysts say was a resemblance to his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, who sometimes wore Western suits. Kim, however, is ""the same ruthless SOB as his father,"" Kim Jong Il, who favored drab Mao-style suits, analyst Robert Kelly tells the Times.","['Departing from his usual black or navy suits, Kim gave his televised speech wearing black-rimmed glasses and slicked back hair, speaking fluently and rarely looking down to read as he raised the possibility of sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea', 'In his first New Year’s address as North Korea’s leader in 2013, Kim frequently sounded short of breath, his voice wavering from time to time', 'Kim, the leader of North Korea, traded his usual atonal, Mao-collared outfits for what looked like the sort of silver-gray suit and matching tie that come straight from the elder statesmen costume department', 'Kim Jong Un has embraced New Year addresses as a chance to outline his policies and rally the North Korean people', 'SEOUL (Reuters) - The light-grey suit and matching tie that North Korea’s Kim Jong Un donned for his New Year’s address was likely carefully calculated to project a softer, more relaxed image to go with his surprise offer for talks with Seoul', 'Last year, he used his speech to declare that North Korea was in the “final stages” of perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile', '“The change from the previous dark Maoist suits to a softer toned grey Western-style suit likely aimed to underpin peace, which Kim stressed in his address,” the institute said', '“In this New Year’s address, North Korea seems to have taken great pains with the image portrayed by Kim Jong Un,” said an analysis by the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification after Kim’s speech', 'His voice, his hair shaved on the side, as well as his light-colored Western-style suit and glasses, were also reminiscent of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, according to defectors and analysts']"
"– A judge sentenced Chris Brown today to a year in jail, but that may end up being just four months—or 6 days—or whatever. In a Los Angeles courtroom, Brown admitted to violating his probation by getting in a fight in Washington, DC, so the judge gave him a one-year sentence, TMZ reports. But subtract 116 days for Brown's time in rehab and 59 more for his days in jail, and you get 131 days. Then consider his 2 days' credit for each day jailed, and the LA County Sheriff's Dept thing for reducing year-long sentences to 240 days, and you may just get ... a 6-day sentence. Brown still needs to attend therapy sessions twice a week, have random drug tests three times a week, and complete his 1,000 hours of community service, the AP reports. And a separate trial for the DC assault is coming up in a couple of months.

"– It's a victory for international agreement, but not for consumers: OPEC nations and Russia have managed to overcome their differences because of their common desire to drive up oil prices, Reuters reports. They have agreed on their first joint output cut since 2001, a move that sent the price of crude oil up around 10% on Wednesday. The Russians and Saudis announced a deal earlier this year, but skeptics found it hard to believe fellow OPEC members Iran and Iraq would come on board. They did, though they'll be giving up less than other cartel members. In total, OPEC says it will cut its output by 1.2 million barrels a day, while the Russians say they'll cut theirs by 300,000. A roundup of coverage: The AP reports that even with the cuts, there's likely to be more supply than demand, meaning that the return of $100-a-barrel oil is not on the horizon, though US consumers may see small rises soon. ""The average Joe filling up his tank may notice in the next week or two that gas prices move higher by 5 to 15 cents a gallon just on the psyche of the deal,"" says GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan. The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal will cut world oil production by around 1% if all parties stick to the agreement—and that is a big if. Enforcement of the agreement is expected to be a big problem, and analysts say the Russians in particular might not cut or even freeze production, especially not if prices keep going up. Analyst Chris Weafer tells CNBC that the announcement of the deal was ""very weak in detail,"" and it appears that Russia will be able to simply reduce its stated 2017 production targets and pass it off as a cut. Shares in US shale oil producers soared after the deal was announced, reports Fortune, which notes that the agreement ""will effectively end the price war started by Saudi Arabia two years ago in its efforts to wrest market share back from US."" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said before a deal was reached that the country was willing to take a ""big hit"" on production. ""I think it is a good day for the oil markets, it is a good day for the industry,"" he told reporters Wednesday, per Reuters. ""It should be a good day for the global economy. I think it will be a boost to global economic growth."" An editorial in the Independent says the deal ""may have done the world a good turn"" by bringing historic enemies Saudi Arabia and Iran together, and by giving the renewable energy industry a boost. The Financial Times reports that the future now looks brighter for US shale producers, who could end up being the biggest winners from the deal. Other winners include brokers who benefited from ""frenzied"" trading in oil futures after the agreement was announced.","['com It is not often that the interests of an industry cartel and the global

"– A Moscow zoo is suing an advertising company for misuse of one of its animals. The bizarre claim? That the company used a raccoon from the zoo in an ""erotic"" ad and traumatized it.

Then the zoo found behind-the-scenes footage of the shoot on the website of Art-Msk and thinks it figured out why: It shows Tomas with a topless model, and the zoo's theory is that the animal was associating breasts with the treats possibly used to coax it during filming. The zoo says it never would have given the OK for the raccoon to be used in a racy ad, and it worries about the raccoon population at large: ""Now everyone who sees this video ... will directly associate raccoons with erotica,” declares the lawsuit. ""Absurd,"" responds the head of marketing for Art-Msk. The ad for blankets and pillows was made for national TV in Russia and thus doesn't come close to ""erotica,"" says Valery Bogatov. In fact, he says the raccoon actually stole the model's bra on set and destroyed it during the August shoot, reports Euro News. ""When the zoo told us they would sue us, we told them we’d file our own suit for the cost of the bra,” he tells the Telegraph. ""I said it as a joke, because I thought they were joking, too."" But the zoo was serious, as this week's filing made clear. It wants all photos and videos related to the shoot taken offline. As for Tomas, he seems to have recovered. ""It took two to three months to change his behavior,"" says a spokesman. ""Now he is happy again."" (An essay argues that keeping apes in zoos is, contrary to popular opinion, a moral imperative.)","['“The plaintiff considers it unacceptable to use a raccoon in video and photographs with a naked woman,” the zoo said in a suit demanding the material be removed from Art-Msk’s website', ""But the zoo's press service said it was not orchestrated, and alleged the video had undermined the reputation of a family-friendly petting zoo"", 'Mr Bogatov has threatened to counter-sue the zoo, and to claim compensation for the damaged bra, the Russian blogsite tjournal reports', 'After the request failed, the zoo filed a lawsuit in October, also demanding compensation for damages caused to the raccoon', 'But in photos and a video, published by the advertising studio and circulating the Internet, the raccoon can be seen being held by a topless model', 'The zoo Animals are not a toy says its raccoon was left traumatised, demoralised and was sexually harassed during the photoshoot, which the company Art-Msk said would advertise blankets and towels', 'According to the zoo, the deal in August 2016 was for Thomas to be used in a regular advertisement', 'ru Image caption This photo from the zoo shows Thomas and the text of the lawsuit', 'A statement the zoo posted on social media about the case featured plenty of socially savvy hashtags, including #interestingmoscow and #scandal', 'But the zoo says that when it saw the footage on social media, featuring a naked model, it complained and asked for all video and photos to be withdrawn', 'A nature conservation group has backed the zoo\'s cause in the raccoon case, and ""anti-exploitation"" activists rallied in Moscow\'s Sokolniki district on 12 March', '“By photographing him with a naked woman, the defendant has caused damage to the raccoon population', 'Animals Aren’t Toys, a privately run “contact zoo” that allows visitors to handle its animals, is now suing the company not only for Tomas’ ordeal, but damage to the reputation of an entire species', 'Tomas the racoon was left “traumatised” and came back with an unhealthy attraction to women’s breasts after the shoot with Moscow studio Art-Msk last year, his owners have said', 'The zoo says it renewed the lawsuit on Tuesday because no action had been taken']"
"– Devotees of French cuisine love their snails. Unfortunately, a slimy and highly invasive flatworm newly discovered in France finds them quite tasty, too, reports AFP. How invasive? ""All snails in Europe could be wiped out,"" says Jean-Lou Justine of the National Museum of History in France. In other words, goodbye, escargot. The culprit is the New Guinea flatworm, known formally as platydemus manokwari, which has the distinction of being on the list of the world's 100 most invasive species. As Quartz notes, the 2-inch worm managed to hitch a ride into Hawaii from its native New Guinea and wiped out 90% of the state's 750 species of land snails. Now a new report in the journal PeerJ warns that all of Europe could be next, unless authorities somehow stop the spread early. The researchers suggest aggressive quarantines wherever the worm is spotted; it first showed up at a botanical gardens in Normandy. ""It may seem ironic, but it’s worth pointing out the effect that this will have on French cooking,"" says lead author Justine. ""If the worms do manage to gain a foothold,"" adds a blogger at Mother Nature Network, ""they could radically transform ecosystems and menus in Europe forever. "" (The worms don't do so well in cold temperatures, so maybe Europe needs a pest-destroying blast of our polar vortex?)","['In this paper, we present evidence for the identification of the species in France, the first record in Europe, and provide a brief review of the records of the species in the world, lists of its known prey, and possible control options', 'In fact it has been and probably will continue to be used by local farmers, and plant protection agencies in the Pacific region as a bio-agent in the control of outbreaks of the Giant African snail Achatina fulica (FAO-SAPA, 2002;

Zainab al-Hilli apparently remembers details of the shooting last week that left her parents and maternal grandmother dead, sources tell the Independent. Zainab was shot in the shoulder and suffered a fractured skull in the attack. Her 4-year-old sister, Zeena, was found, unharmed, hiding beneath the bodies of her parents. Both girls are under police guard. The interview with Zainab was cut short so as not to overtax or further traumatize her, but she may be able to identify the attackers, say sources. A single weapon using outmoded ammunition was used to kill the al-Hilli family and Sylvain Mollier, a French cyclist who happened upon the scene. At least 25 shots were fired above Lake Annecy in southeastern France. Stumped authorities are investigating the possibility that a sibling feud over money may have been behind the killing of Saad al-Hilli, a British-Iraqi aeronautical engineer, his wife, and his mother-in-law, reports AP.

"– North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency is out with a doozy of a report: It says the North has ""uncovered and smashed"" a plot by the CIA and South Korea's Intelligence Service to assassinate Kim Jong Un. The North says the two agencies worked in cahoots with a North Korean citizen and an unnamed terrorist group on the plot, which involved using a ""biochemical substance"" on Kim, reports the BBC. The idea was apparently to deliver some kind of slow-acting poison, possibly at a military parade, that would kill the North Korean leader over the course of six months to a year. The report said the ""terrorists"" who were to carry out the plot had entered the country, but the North said it would ""mercilessly destroy"" them. As for the traitorous North Korean citizen, the report said only that he had a surname of Kim. Pyongyang, of course, is known for its far-out claims, though CNN notes that South Korea has previously acknowledged having plans in place to assassinate Kim. Still, this latest claim is likely to be bogus and just part of the recent war of words between the countries, a professor at Tongji University in Shanghai tells the Washington Post.

"– A tiff over cold chicken nuggets apparently led to a trashed Florida Chick-fil-A. Action News Jax reports on the incident, which took place Monday night in a Jacksonville restaurant and started with what witnesses say was a teen boy complaining he wasn't satisfied with his order. Allison Music, who recorded part of what happened on her phone, says she first saw the boy ""making a complete fool of himself"" while arguing with workers for 15 or 20 minutes. Next, she continues, two women approached the counter, which is where her video (posted on Facebook) begins. In the clip, one of the women can be heard referring to the boy who'd been involved in the previous argument as ""our brother,"" and the two verbally spar with employees over his nuggets being cold and how he should get a refund. A woman who appears to be a manager finally tells them she did give him his money back. A police report notes that at one point the women were told to leave because the store was closing, but once outside, one allegedly tried to re-enter, slamming on a locked door and causing $900 worth of damage (Music says the door handle broke off and the women then entered through an unlocked door). A second video shows one of the women storming off, leaving behind a floor littered with condiment packs and straws. Once off-screen, she appears to hurl something (reportedly one of Chick-fil-A's table vases). The restaurant owner says they are cooperating with the police in the probe.

"– Fentanyl suppliers on the so-called ""dark web"" are delisting the drug because it's just too dangerous—and tends to attract police attention, the Guardian reports. If true, the move places fentanyl alongside explosives and certain firearms that are too risky for some purveyors to sell. ""There are marketplaces that will not accept listings for weapons and explosives—those are the ones that will not accept listings for fentanyl,"" says Vince O’Brien, a drug-enforcement officer at the National Crime Agency in Britain. ""Clearly, law enforcement would prioritize the supply of weapons, explosives and fentanyl over, for example, class C drugs—and that might well be why they do this."" A powerful pain-killer, fentanyl is so dangerous that even a sugar packet of it can kill 500 people, the LA Times reports. The opioid's rising popularity has caused roughly 160 deaths in the UK and many more in America, where nearly 29,000 people died in 2017 from synthetic-opioid-linked overdoses. Police say labs in China are producing fentanyl, which is often processed by Mexican cartels and sold domestically as pills or mixed into heroin and other substances.

"– A woman is suing a Denver Starbucks over a spilled cup of hot tea she claims caused second-degree burns that disfigured her and killed her dog, the Denver Post reports. A federal lawsuit filed by Deanna Salas-Solano, 58, contends an employee at the drive-thru window didn't secure the lid to the ""unreasonably hot"" 20-ounce tea she ordered in September 2015. The complaint says the cup was so hot it began to burn her hands; tea then spilled onto her lap, melting her clothes and scalding her stomach, legs, and lap. Her dog, Alexander, was splashed and burned. He was taken to the vet and died shortly after. With 2% of her body surface severely burned, Salas-Solano underwent surgery the following day and needed to get skin grafts. The legal action seeking more than $75,000 for injuries, emotional distress, and lost wages notes Salas-Solano hadn't ordered an ""extra hot"" tea. The barista didn't slip a cardboard sleeve on the hot cup and, contrary to Starbucks policy, didn't use a second cup, the suit says. A wall timer marks how fast employees fill orders, per the filing. Starbucks denies the charges, saying a video contradicts the woman's claims. Their legal teams wouldn't provide a copy of it, but KDVR watched it and says it's ""not conclusive"" what happened. The footage shows Salas-Solano on her cellphone, with her dog on her lap, but the station says it's unclear if she spilled the tea because the cup was hot, she got distracted, or due to a jostle by the dog. Starbucks says in a statement: ""We don't have any reason to believe our partner (employee) was at fault.""

"– Tom Junod of Esquire thinks modern-day 42-year-old women are the bomb, through some combination of sexiness, frankness about sexiness, gravitas, self-confidence, yoga, Pilates, feminism, and summer dresses. ""A few generations ago, a woman turning 42 was expected to voluntarily accept the shackles of biology and convention,"" he writes. ""Now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free."" He ticks off names such as Cameron Diaz, Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Garner, and Amy Poehler to make his point. And he similarly asks us to imagine a remake of the 1967 movie The Graduate, when a young Dustin Hoffman is disgusted with himself for having an affair with the 42-year-old Mrs. Robinson. The movie wouldn't be quite the same today, he writes. ""It is hard to feel sorry for a young man who goes to bed with the woman everybody else in the theater wants to go to bed with."" In short, 42 ain't what it used to be. The essay, however, is getting just as much buzz for the reaction, often in the form of ridicule, from female writers. Some examples: Tracy Moore, Jezebel: ""The only thing more ludicrous than Tom Junod's feelings about 42-year-olds are the misguided assumptions that lurk beneath them…like a 42-year-old woman clawing at the icy surface above her, desperate to escape the tomb of her old age and fading beauty, trapped in part because she acknowledges that icy cold water could significantly invigorate her appearance."" Sarah Miller, the Hairpin: She professed relief upon reading the piece: ""Tom Junod still wanted to have sex with me, and more importantly, laugh over hamburgers afterward, as he admired me in a stunning shift. Because according to Junod, I’m still hot—not like 42-year-old women used to be, back when they were super gross, like Anne Bancroft in The Graduate. And according to Junod what makes me hot isn’t just being hot, it’s that, unlike other women who just haven’t had all this time, I also finally figured out how to be sort of interesting.""

"– Buckingham Palace has made it very clear that it is not amused by the leak of a video showing a very young Princess Elizabeth giving a Nazi salute, but some historians have welcomed the chance to take a fresh look at King Edward VIII, the man in the video. While the girls are clearly just playing around, Edward—who became king a few years after the 1933 video and then abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson—had close ties to Germany and was often accused of having Nazi sympathies, the Independent reports. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1937 and discussed becoming the figurehead for a Hitler-friendly international peace movement, the BBC reports. Historians believe Hitler might have put Edward back on the throne if he had successfully invaded Britain. The Sun has been condemned for leaking the footage, but it should be saluted for reminding the world that Edward ""was a charming, libidinous idiot,"" writes Peter Preston at the Guardian. ""He dabbled his toes in the fascist stream that ran through the 1930s. He belonged instinctively to a gullible ruling class that longed to bring 'order' and 'control' to a tumultuous decade."" But there has been no suggestion that the queen's parents had Nazi leanings, reports the New York Times, which notes that they were praised for staying in London instead of fleeing to Canada during wartime bombing, with the queen mother saying, ""The children won't go without me. I won't leave the king.

"– For six months, Joe Bell had been walking, determined to make it across the country to memorialize his 15-year-old son, who was openly gay and killed himself in January after being bullied at school. But last Wednesday, his journey ended in a second tragedy for the family: Bell was hit and killed by a tractor-trailer on a rural Colorado road after the driver apparently fell asleep, the New York Times reports. Bell, 48, planned to walk from his home in Oregon to New York City, because son Jadin wanted to live there one day, and he had been sharing his son's story as he walked in an attempt to raise awareness of bullying. Bell spoke anywhere he could, from schools to gay-outreach centers to motorcycle rallies, and thousands of people were following his trek on a Joe's Walk for Change Facebook page. (You can read their tributes and see photos of Bell and Jadin here.) He planned to be on the road at least two years, carrying his things on his back and in a pushcart, and getting help from strangers who became friends along the way. He was set to speak at a Hugo, Colo., church the day he died, an engagement set up by a sheriff he met who also has a gay son. ""This man had to [have] made a huge difference in everyone he met,"" the sheriff says. ""He made me realize how important basic humanity still is.""

"– The town of Woodland, North Carolina, is taking a drubbing online after its town council not only shot down a proposed solar farm but put a moratorium on future similar projects. It wasn't the mere rejection, however, that's drawing ridicule but some of the comments made by local residents during the comment period as rounded up by the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald. The big one: A man voiced concern that ""solar farms would suck up all the energy from the sun and businesses would not come to Woodland,"" in the words of the newspaper. ""You’re killing your town,"" he told planning officials. ""All the young people are going to move out."" A retired science teacher also worried that solar farms would interfere with photosynthesis and result in dead plants around town, and might even cause cancer. ""I want to know what's going to happen,"" she said. ""I want information."" A representative from the company that floated the proposal assured everyone that solar panels make use only of the sunlight that hits them directly and ""don’t draw additional sunlight,"" but the nays still won the day. (The News-Herald notes that the town council had previously given the green light to three other solar farms.) The story is now generating not-so-flattering headlines all over. A post at Science Alert begins, ""Wow"" and hopes that ""increased exposure and better education"" about solar power will help. Ars Technica, meanwhile, looks at satellite images to question one resident's contention that solar farms were becoming a nuisance in the area, while newspapers in the the UK and as far away as Australia are joining in to snigger at the idea of solar panels sucking up all the sun's energy.

"– Maybe the officers were dog people? The Local reports a woman in Madrid was fined by police Sunday for carrying a bag that read ""All Cats Are Beautiful."" The two riot officers that stopped graphic designer Belén Lobero claimed the acronym on the bag—despite the drawing of a cat and aforementioned phrase—actually stood for ""All Cops Are Bastards,"" according to El País. That meaning of the acronym dates back to the 1970s, was made famous by a British punk band, and is frequently used by soccer hooligans. A police spokesperson tells the AP the lettering on the bag is similar to that used in anti-cop tattoos and graffiti. Officers hit Lobero with a fine of up to $670 under Spain's Public Security Law, which—among other things—makes ""disrespecting the police"" illegal. Lobero took to social media to complain about the fine. ""What a bloody disgusting country,"" the Local quotes one of her Facebook posts as saying. ""But well, ALL CATS ARE BEAUTIFUL and anyone who says otherwise is lying."" Her tweet about the incident was shared more than 20,000 times. After that, the Madrid police commissioner decided to drop the fine against her, citing the bag's ""ambivalence."" The Public Security Law went into effect last July.

"– If Woody Allen were to throw a dinner party, he could probably count on invites being accepted by Diane Keaton, Alec Baldwin, and now, Javier Bardem. In a new interview in Paris Match, the Spanish actor says he's ""very shocked at this sudden treatment"" of Allen, who's now widely seen as a pariah in Hollywood due to sexual abuse allegations from his daughter, Dylan Farrow. ""Judgments in the states of New York and Connecticut found him innocent,"" Bardem said. ""The legal situation today is the same as in 2007."" The Guardian and People note there was actually ""probable cause"" to prosecute Allen, per a Connecticut state's attorney, but that he never went to trial because prosecutors didn't want to force a ""fragile"" young Farrow onto the stand. Either way, Bardem says he's ""absolutely not ashamed"" for having worked with Allen on 2008's Vicky Cristina Barcelona. ""If there was evidence that Woody Allen was guilty, then yes, I would have stopped working with him, but I have doubts,"" he says. On the #MeToo movement in general, Bardem adds: ""Today, we have the impression there are men on one side and women on the other, which sends a very bad message to the younger generation.

"– Explorer Benedict Allen is no longer missing in Papua New Guinea, having been flown to the country's capital via helicopter Friday. As for what mucked with Allen's itinerary, the BBC reports he missed his flight after becoming ""disorientated with fever."" His agent describes it as suspected malaria. The Daily Mail quotes him as saying ""things were not looking good. I had this terrible dilemma: do I stay out here in a remote village and believe that, somehow, a miracle would happen and a plane would come—or do I try to control my destiny somehow and head out to find help when I'm weak?"" He was ultimately spotted at a remote airstrip. But the ordeal is not entirely over: The Guardian reports Allen is now receiving no shortage of criticism over his decision to make the trek to hopefully reconnect with the Yaifo tribe without any type of tracking device, leading others to suspect it was all a stunt (""utterly not true,"" says his agent). Still others are bothered at the press coverage, with the paper quoting one such criticism, from an ethnomusicologist who spent a decade in Papua New Guinea: ""Why should we care about a lost, unprepared, silly, white privileged male middle-aged fool?

"– The literature world rejoiced yesterday in hearing that Harper Lee would be publishing her reportedly long-lost second novel more than 50 years after To Kill a Mockingbird. But others aren't so sure everything's on the up-and-up, citing the author's notoriously publicity-shy nature, the recent death of her fiercely protective sister, and the somewhat shady characters that have swirled around her for years, perhaps preying on her age and reported ill health. After all, Lee won a Pulitzer Prize in 1961 for her debut effort, and in a 1962 press conference, when asked how she felt about a possible second novel, she replied, ""I'm scared,"" as per the New York Times. (Lee herself noted in the publisher's statement released yesterday that she'd written the new novel before Mockingbird.) As Megan Garber writes for the Atlantic in pondering Lee's legacy: ""Why end the silence? And why do it now?"" The skepticism partly comes from the fact that Lee has been linked in the past (and perhaps the present) with those who may not have been looking after her best interests. She sued Samuel Pinkus, her ex-agent, for reportedly ""duping"" her out of the copyright to Mockingbird (they settled in 2013); she disputed she had anything to do with a memoir published about her in 2014; and she ""has a history of signing whatever's put in front of her,"" sometimes at the urging of Tonja Carter, her tight-lipped attorney, Gawker has noted. But it's the loss of Alice Lee—her older sister and most ardent protector—that may have upped the vulnerability level of Lee, said by multiple sources to be mostly blind and deaf after a 2007 stroke. ""Just feels very potentially exploitative, especially given how TKAM itself was exploited and how badly Lee was cheated,"" a tweet cited on Jezebel reads.","['But it’s worth considering, either way, something that is both inconvenient and also indicative of the expectations we place on the small cadre of people we have elevated to the status of Author: that Harper Lee, née and known to those close to her as Nelle, spent the majority of her life not wanting Go Set a Watchman to be published', 'His first move was to obtain the copyright to To Kill a Mockingbird, which he did on May 5, 2007, “as part of a scheme to secure to himself an irrevocable interest in the income stream from Harper Lee’s copyright and to avoid his legal obligations to M&O under the arbitration decision,” Lee’s lawsuit contends', '“I used to take Harper Lee down here until she got too old to play,” said the refined, white-haired reverend, stopping beside a corner slot machine, where in early May 2007, he said, he had found the writer gambling in the company of her local attorney, Tonja Carter, “who was handing her money,” and a visitor from New York in a “sport shirt with the tail hanging out,” whose name was Samuel L', 'The Defendant apparently believes that she lacks the desire to police her trademarks, and therefore seeks to take advantage of Ms', 'In 1991, the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Library of Congress’s Center for the Book said it rated behind only the Bible in books that are “most often cited as making a difference in people’s lives', 'Her lawsuit outlines her frustration: “In the years since Pinkus left M&O, he has acted on Harper Lee’s behalf primarily to the extent of trying to secure irrevocably his right to commissions from TKAM until the end of copyright', 'Although she lived frugally in her apartment on East 82nd Street, she enjoyed attending Mets games, treating friends to meals in restaurants, going to the theater, visiting museums and cemeteries, and playing the slots in Atlantic City', 'Her lawsuit alleged the copyright assignment to him was ""a gross example of self-dealing"" and was intended to ""secure to himself an irrevocable interest in the income stream"" from sales of her book', 'Most of what Mills appears to have learned is on the order of knowing that Harper Lee is a Christopher Guest fan (!) or that she believed that Truman Capote, her childhood friend and the model for Dill in Mockingbird, was a ""psychopath', 'Meanwhile, back in Monroeville, according to the complaint, Harper Lee had become “increasingly dissatisfied” over receiving royalties with no backup information, as well as over Pinkus’s visits to the assisted-living facility, where Pinkus often visited her, “especially when he had papers that needed to be signed … sometimes without prior announcement until Harper Lee finally gave orders that the management of the facility was not to permit his entrance', 'Lee, who won the Pulitzer prize in 1961 for To Kill a Mockingbird, alleged in her lawsuit that Pinkus ""duped"" her into signing over the copyright to the novel in 2007', 'After all, To Kill a Mockingbird might not exist had it not been for the efforts of her first agent, Maurice Crain, the husband of Annie Laurie Williams, the film agent who had sold the movie rights to Gone with the Wind and who would later do the same for To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Pinkus abused that trust and took advantage of Harper Lee’s physical condition and years of trust built at M&O to engineer the assignment of her copyright in a document that did not even ensure her a contractual right to income', ') According to Lee’s lawsuit, on April 11, 2011, two months after assigning his To Kill a Mockingbird copyright to Posner and PPI, Pinkus met with Harper Lee and Tonja Carter, who was a legal protégée of Alice Lee’s, and the agent presented them with a document to confirm that Lee had signed over her Mockingbird copyright to him', '] DADDY’S GIRL From left: Harper Lee in 1961, the year she won the Pulitzer Prize for the novel (inset); a scene from the 1962 film of To Kill a Mockingbird, with Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar, and Mary Badham as the author’s surrogate', '“During its decades of representation, M&O acted appropriately and in Harper Lee’s interests, handling the kinds of activities that are the business of a literary agent,” Lee stated in her lawsuit', 'When the agency’s principal, Patricia Myrer, retired, in 1984, she tapped Winick to be president of M&O, and he became the agent and attorney for the literary estates handled by M&O as well as for writers including Mary Higgins Clark and Harper Lee', 'The dispute was complicated, but boils down to this: in 2007, Pinkus (who inherited Lee as a client) had Lee sign a document which assigned the copyright in her books to him', '“We had always been told she was a complete recluse, but at the end of the lunch she walked around the table to me and said, ‘Do you think the two of us could have lunch à deux?

"– Chris Rock's cryptic tweet on Friday about a ""blackout"" had many wondering what the comedian had in store for his second turn hosting the Academy Awards (Weinstein Co. co-chair Harvey Weinstein, for one, predicted Rock would ""annihilate"" Hollywood, per the Hollywood Reporter). This anticipation was spawned by the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, a protest not only against the fact that nominations in the award show's major categories don't adequately represent people of color or those in the LGBT community, but also that the film industry overall is lacking in its opportunities for minorities. And Rock addressed the issue as soon as the opening scenes from this year's nominated films came to a close. ""Man, I counted at least 15 black people in that montage!"" he exclaimed, per the Washington Post. He explained that he didn't boycott the show as some black luminaries were doing because the ""last thing I need is to lose another job to Kevin Hart"" and that ""Jada [Pinkett Smith] boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited!"" He also wondered aloud why there hadn't been as big of a protest during the previous 87 award shows. His conclusion? Black people have had bigger things to worry about. ""We were too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best cinematographer,"" he said. ""When your grandmother's swinging from the tree, it's really hard to care about best documentary foreign short."" But he turned serious as he summed up the issue in Hollywood: ""We want opportunity. We want black actors to get the same opportunities.

"– Comcast is reviving the idea of Internet data caps, and intends to roll them out to all of its customers in the coming years. At a conference yesterday, Executive VP David Cohen said he envisioned implementing ""a usage-based billing model"" for everyone within five years. Customers would have to pay a fee if they used too much bandwidth in a month—though Cohen said the cap might be as high as 350 gigabytes or even 500 gigabytes, CNN reports. Cohen added that Comcast would likely keep increasing that cap over time. ""We will always want to say the basic level of usage at a sufficiently high level that the vast majority of our customers are not implicated,"" he said. Comcast is already experimenting with 300-gigabyte caps in some markets, which it once told Ars Technica affect only 2% of users. Basically the move is a shot across the bow at cord cutters, observes Amadou Diallo at Forbes. Comcast ""could essentially say, 'Want to drop our TV service? Go ahead. But it’s going to cost you.'""","['""I would also predict that the vast majority of our customers would never be caught in the buying the additional buckets of usage, that we will always want to say the basic level of usage at a sufficiently high level that the vast majority of our customers are not implicated by the usage-based billing plan,"" Cohen said', 'Cohen said he doesn\'t think Comcast will ever have a system in which ""80% of customers"" are impacted by data limits and are forced to pay for additional usage, though he added that it\'s ""very difficult to make predictions', 'That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved', 'Cohen said the company would aim to set the limit at a level where ""the vast majority of our customers"" wouldn\'t be affected', '"" Cohen today said that Comcast will raise the limit over time so that the large majority of users won\'t go over it, suggesting that 500GB is a possible monthly limit five years from now', ""If the deal is approved, the combined group will be the country's dominant provider of television channels and Internet connections, reaching roughly one in three American homes"", 'A Comcast executive said he expects the company will roll out ""usage-based billing""—what most people call ""data caps""—to all of its customers within five years', ""Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors"", '""I don\'t think that\'s the model that we are heading toward, but five years ago, I don\'t know that I would have heard of something called an iPad,"" he said', 'When asked if customers will get a ""reasonably large number of usage plans"" to choose from, Cohen said he doesn\'t want a situation where ""80 percent of our customers are implicated by usage-based billing and are all buying different packets of usage', ""I don't think that's the model that we are heading toward, but five years ago I don't know that I would have heard of something called an iPad"", 'David Cohen, executive vice president of America\'s largest cable company, predicted at a conference Wednesday that in five years\' time, the company will have ""a usage-based billing model rolled out across its footprint']"
"– More than 12 hours after President Trump's national security adviser suddenly resigned, and the story looks poised to continue dominating headlines and the goings-on in Washington for the foreseeable future. Here are some of the latest updates on the ongoing Michael Flynn situation: On Tuesday morning, Kellyanne Conway told Today that Flynn decided to resign because he ""knew he had become a lightning rod."" But during a press briefing a few hours later, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said Trump asked Flynn to resign due to an ""eroding level of trust,"" the New York Times reports. Spicer also insisted that Flynn hadn't broken the law. Regardless, even Republican senators—including Senate majority whip John Cornyn—are now calling for an investigation into Flynn and his talks with the Russian ambassador, though Cornyn wouldn't go so far as to say Flynn should testify, according to CNN. Meanwhile, Trump insists leaks, not Flynn's resignation, are the ""real story."" ""Why are there so many illegal leaks coming out?"" Politico quotes the president as saying. The Washington Post has a list of 10 questions about Flynn's actions and resignation that still haven't been answered, including if Flynn will face prosecution or if Spicer or the vice president will apologize to America for lying, deliberately or otherwise. Finally, Vox reports that before the Flynn situation, lifting Russian sanctions would be ""controversial but doable"" for Trump. But to do so now ""would blow up in Trump's face.""","['Cornyn said that he had not been briefed on the transcripts of calls between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the US, but expects the issue to come up with members of the Senate intelligence committee meet later Tuesday', 'Who exactly is in charge at the White House?

According to one estimate, climbers leave 26,500 pounds of excrement on Everest every year, Gawker notes.

"– How likely is it that Vladimir Putin was behind the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in England? ""Overwhelmingly likely"" in the eyes of UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

"– Henry VIII once called hops a ""wicked and pernicious weed,"" but they're crucial to the production of most beers, especially when it comes to ""hoppy"" India Pale Ales, or IPAs. In fact, more than 4,000 brewers are battling for less than a dozen popular hop varieties ""like a bunch of wolves going after a carcass,"" Wicked Weed Brewing co-owner Luke Dickinson tells the Wall Street Journal. The result is a shortage of the weed even as its production continues to rise; farmland devoted to the crop has jumped 65% in the past five years alone, but the number of brewers has grown faster, doubling from 2,000 to 4,000 in that same period. Competition is so fierce, and hops so slow to mature (it takes the vines two to three years), that some brewers are forced to turn away thousands of barrels of beer orders. Ironically, the resulting slowdown in craft beer production growth this year has farmers worrying about a coming glut of hops, not to mention a concern about how reliable all the new breweries will be two, three, four years down the road. This has farmers cautious even as demand outpaces supply. Further complicating matters is that craft brewers are looking for aroma hops to add flavor, not alpha hops that give Budweiser and Miller Lite their bitterness, resulting in a wide variety of new and niche hops, many of which have small orders. ""To deal with a few boxes of this [variety] and few pellets of that is a real challenge,"" says Diane Gooding of Gooding Farms in Idaho. And then there's climate change, reports Slate, with hot weather in Europe destroying huge hop harvests, which could lead to pricier beers. (Pumpkins have caused brewers headaches, too.)","['And according to the Wall Street Journal, that shortage is one factor slowing down the rise of craft beer sales—which last year increased 8 percent, “ending six years of double-digit growth', 'The brewer has had so much trouble finding enough of a special type of hops called citra—the plant that gives its popular Tropicália ale its bitter flavor and fruity aroma—that it has been forced to reject orders for about 8,000 barrels of beer during the past year', ""I wouldn't exactly say it's time to pour one out for the craft beer boom based on those numbers, but the hop problem does illustrate how what economists call “frictions”—and what the rest of us call real life—can muck with the laws of supply and demand"", ""The upshot is that right now, supply can't really stretch to meet demand, which has made hops—particularly hot new breeds that beer nerds are clamoring for—much more expensive"", 'Farmers are devoting 65 percent more acres to growing hops than they were five years ago, according to the Journal', ""Unfortunately, farmers apparently can't produce enough of the little green flowers to keep up with the demand from the ever-growing number of American breweries""]"

"– Aitabdel Salem needed to hand over only $2 to bail himself out of Rikers Island, a fact he found out after a five-month stay. The 41-year-old Queens man was initially jailed on $25,000 bail for allegedly attacking an officer who arrested him on suspicion of theft at a retail store on Nov. 21, 2014, reports the New York Daily News. A week later, prosecutors couldn't get an indictment, and Salem was ordered released. First, though, he needed to pay $1 bail for each of two other charges of tampering and mischief—and he would have, had he been informed of the change. The Algerian native says his lawyer at the time, a legal aid defender, never told him that a $2 bill would be enough to set him free—the equivalent of a slice of pizza in New York City, notes the Washington Post. Salem ""was shocked and dismayed and frustrated that his case was unconscionably mishandled,"" his new lawyers told a hearing. He was finally released in the spring of 2015, but he missed the police assault arraignment in May of that year—and Salem blames that on another communication foul-up by his original attorney involving an errant address. Still, the mix-up led to charges of bail jumping, and Salem was sent back to jail with bail set at $30,000. He remains locked up.

"– A disgruntled 290-pound White Castle fan is taking his pain to court, Fox News reports. Stockbroker Martin Kessman, 64, is suing the fast food chain for not expanding its booths for his meaty girth. He complained two years ago after banging a knee against a table support at his local franchise in Nanuet, New York, the New York Post reports. He says the company sent three ""very condescending letters,"" each containing ""a coupon for three free hamburgers—but the cheese was extra!” However, White Castle also promised to expand its seats, Kessman says: ""They sent me specs and everything. ... So two and a half years went by, and nothing was done."" Now he says the booths violate his rights as a fat person.

"– The Senate approved a historic farm bill today that eliminates all cash payments to producers, but invests massively in food stamps and crop insurance, Politico reports. The overall bill: $1 trillion over 10 years, which means $24 billion in savings, the New York Times says. The bill was forged by the unlikely partisan duo of newcomer Debbie Stabenow and cantankerous old-timer Pat Roberts. “That’s what can happen when we break the logjam of partisanship and work together to get something done,"" said Roberts. But the bill faces a harsher battle in the House, where Republicans want to cut back the food stamp program that accounts for most of the bill's spending. Representatives may preview their debate next week, when a $19.4 billion agriculture bill is slated to hit the floor. On July 11, Rep. Frank Lucas will start markup of his own farm bill. But Lucas will have to lean left and right, Politico notes, to maintain target price supports while appeasing Tea Partiers who want to beat the savings offered by the Senate.","['Currently, the government subsidizes about 62 percent of the crop insurance premiums, and the policies typically guarantee 75 percent to 85 percent of a farmer’s revenue', 'On the surface they make an odd couple: she, the newcomer, always upbeat and confident, and he the more cantankerous veteran of decades of farm battles', 'A landmark five-year farm bill cleared the Senate Thursday, putting pressure on the House to act this summer and adding a big new piece to the budget puzzle that Congress and the White House must resolve before automatic spending cuts take effect in January', 'Going forward, much depends still on the House response to the Senate measure', 'But defying doubters, they forged an agreement this week allowing scores of amendments and brought the bill across the floor largely intact', 'But for the first time crop insurance would be subject to payment limits, and recipients of the subsidy would have to follow soil and water conservation requirements, as they do in other farm programs', 'In the House, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Representative Frank D', 'While they said the bill provided incentives for low-income families to buy more fruits and vegetables, they argue that the cuts will have a devastating effect on low-income families during a time of high unemployment', 'Amid all the acrimony of this year, the bill is foremost a personal triumph for the partnership forged between Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich', 'The House Republican budget introduced earlier this year by Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, would reduce food stamp spending by about $134 billion over the next decade and turn the program into block grants for the states', 'Still, he said, “We applaud the provisions that require farmers who receive crop insurance subsidies to carry out basic environmental protections on their farms and to reduce insurance subsidies for the largest and most successful agribusinesses', '“Now is the time to protect and strengthen food nutrition assistance, not cut it,” said Eric Olsen, the group’s senior vice president of government relations and public policy', '), who is also part of the farm coalition, said he hopes “the tone” set by Stabenow-Roberts will carry over to the difficult tax issues he must next confront', 'The bill reduces the premium subsidy for farmers with adjusted gross incomes of more than $750,000', 'These must be mailed out each year, and Toomey argued that if no violations had been found, rural companies overseen by the Agriculture Department could simply post the analysis on the Internet, thereby saving paperwork costs', 'And the farm bill savings could yet become an important part of the same year-end calculus on automatic spending cuts ordered under last summer’s debt accord', 'Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a Washington research organization, said the bill failed to achieve real savings because it expanded crop insurance', 'Adopted 64-35, the measure is one of the few bipartisan bills to promise real savings: more than $24 billion over 10 years', 'The measure would affect only 1,500 out of the 1']"

"– For the first time in five attempts, amateur golfer Christopher Crawford looked poised to qualify for the 64-player match-play tournament at the United States Amateur Championship in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Then his game went, well, downhill. While preparing for a shot, 23-year-old Crawford realized his caddie was using the slope function on his distance-measuring device to read the course at Bel Air Country Club, reports ESPN. Though measuring instruments are permitted, Crawford's caddie—a last-minute fill-in for his regular caddie, who was sick—apparently didn't realize slope-reading was banned. What was Crawford to do? ""I know nobody else would have known,"" he says. But ""I knew instantly that I had to disqualify myself."" Had the slope reader been used once, Crawford would have been given a two-shot penalty. But Crawford's caddie had used the feature repeatedly and USGA rules state ""multiple uses of a distance-measuring device with the slope feature activated"" are grounds for disqualification, per Golf.com. ""This is the biggest amateur tournament, and it's a commitment financially"" so ""to have it end in such a disappointing way is pretty crushing,"" Crawford tells ESPN. Still, he doesn't want praise for his sportsmanship. ""You might as well congratulate a man for not robbing a bank,"" he says. He's getting it anyway. ""Tournament finishes ultimately get lost to history.

"– Three organizations and 17 members of Chris Christie's current and former staff—including former deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, ex-campaign manager Bill Stepien, and press secretary Michael Drewniak—were last night slapped with subpoenas demanding they hand over any Bridgegate documents to a legislative panel looking into the mess, the Bergen Record reports. The governor was not included in the list. The news comes as a preliminary inquiry by Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Chair Jay Rockefeller found ""zero evidence"" that the lane closures on George Washington Bridge were tied to a legitimate traffic study, the Asbury Park Press reports. The number of investigations into the traffic scandal are racking up—one each in the state Assembly and Senate, plus US Attorney's Office, Port Authority inspector general, and Senate Committee reviews.

"– A Massachusetts mom isn't too thrilled with the word-ban imposed by her daughter's preschool, the AP reports. Christine Hartwell says her 4-year-old daughter Julia came home unhappy from the Pentucket Workshop Preschool in Georgetown because her teacher said the term ""best buddy"" was forbidden. ""I think it's ridiculous,"" Hartwell tells WIS-TV. ""Children who are four years old speak from their heart, so they should be able to call kids anything loving."" The school explained to the Hartwells that the term ""best friend ... can lead other children to feel excluded"" and ""ultimately lead to the formation of cliques and outsiders,"" per ABC 7. Pentucket hasn't responded to the media, leaving a gap filled by pediatric psychologist Gregory Young: ""I think that words are really important and the term 'best' does have an implied meaning to it,"" he says, ""[but] I don't know if the right answer is necessarily denying children the ability to use that term."" Media reports in recent years have referred to a ""best friend"" ban in European and British schools but didn't give any concrete evidence, the Washington Post reports. As for Julia, she seems unnerved by the whole thing: ""Even now she goes to say it in a loving way—'I'm going to go see my best friend Charlie' or this one or that one—and she looks at me sideways as she's saying it and she's checking in with me to see if that language is okay,"" Hartwell says.","['The school explained to Hartwell that ""the term best friend can lead other children to feel excluded,"" and it can ""ultimately lead to the formation of cliques and outsiders,"" and the school encourages ""students to have a wider group of friends', 'Hartwell says Julia still says ""best friend"" at home, but her daughter seems unsure if the term is appropriate since she was told not to use it at school""Even now she goes to say it in a loving way -- \'I\'m going to go see my best friend Charlie\' or this one or that one -- and she looks at me sideways as she\'s saying it, and she\'s checking in with me to see if that language is OK,"" Hartwell said', 'But, in a letter to the Hartwells they said, it had been their experience that the use of the term ""best friend,"" even when used in a loving way, can lead some children feeling excluded', '” The school, she told the station, said the term can lead to feelings of exclusion and the formation of cliques', 'The preschool offered an explanation to Julia\'s parents, saying ""the term ‘best friend’ can lead other children to feel excluded and it can ultimately lead to the formation of cliques and outsiders', '” The story said the private Thomas’s day school in Battersea — the school Prince William’s son attends — encourages students to have a lot of friends, and tells parents to invite all children to birthday parties', 'That’s not the same as discouraging having a best friend or banning the use of the term on campus', 'Hartwell was quoted as saying about her daughter: “Even now, she goes to say it in a loving way, ‘I’m going to see my best friend Charlie’ or this one or that, and she looks at me sideways', '""Although I think that words are really important and the term \'best\' does have an implied meaning to it, I don\'t know if the right answer is necessarily denying children the ability to use that term,” said Gregory Young, a pediatric psychologist', 'Christine Hartwell said her daughter will not be going to school the rest of the year', 'Hartwell says her daughter will not be going to school the rest of the year', 'Some schools are attempting to ban the entire concept of children having best friends', '11, 2017, article in the British edition of Marie Claire magazine with this headline: “Prince George won’t be allowed to have a best friend at school', '""Even now she goes to say it in a loving way - \'I\'m going to go see my best friend Charlie\' or this one or that one - and she looks at me sideways as she\'s saying it and she\'s checking in with me to see if that language is okay', 'A 2013 article in the British newspaper the Telegraph reported that there was no official policy at the Battersea school but that its headmaster, Ben Thomas, said there was “sound judgment” behind discouraging children from picking best friends', 'The school wants to encourage their students to have a wider group of friends', 'Christine Hartwell, the mother of 4-year-old Julia, told WBZ that she thought the practice was “ridiculous', 'I don\'t know if the right answer is necessarily denying children the ability to use that term,"" said Dr', ""The teacher told her that she couldn't say that there in school,” Julia’s mother, Christine Hartwell, said"", '""""Although I think that words are really important and the term \'best\' does have an implied meaning to it', 'Sign of the apocalypse?']"
"– If Kirsten Gillibrand decides to run for president, Politico reports that she shouldn't expect help from several big Democratic donors during the primaries. The reason? Her role in forcing Al Franken to resign last year. The website talks to more than a dozen big donors and bundlers on both coasts who say they will not donate to the New York senator or help her raise money. If Gillibrand ends up as the nominee, that would change, but she won't be getting any help before then. The gist of the sentiment is that Gillibrand led a rush to judgment on Franken before the sexual harassment allegations against him were properly vetted. “I do hear people refer to Kirsten Gillibrand as ‘opportunistic’ and shrewd at the expense of others to advance herself and it seems to have been demonstrated in her rapid treatment of her colleague Al Franken,” donor Susie Tompkins Buell tells Politico. ""I know [Gillibrand] thought she was doing the right thing, but I think she will be remembered by this,"" she adds. Gillibrand, for her part, has staunchly defended her role. When George Soros voiced a similar complaint against her in August, she responded, “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him.” A post at Jezebel suggests it's unfair for the likes of Tompkins Buell to punish Gillibrand, whose call for Franken to step down was quickly joined by other female lawmakers. ""That Democratic donors are now withholding their money from Gillibrand is a reminder that there are costs for speaking up—and powerful people ready to enforce them,"" writes Clio Chang.

"– Canada's new leader had some bad news for President Obama in their first conversation since his stunning election win on Monday. Justin Trudeau told Obama that he plans to follow through on his campaign promise and end Canada's role in the airstrike campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, CNN reports. Trudeau, who didn't say exactly when the fighter jets sent by ousted Prime Minister Stephen Harper last year would withdraw from the fight, said Obama ""understands the commitments I have made around ending the combat mission,"" reports the CBC, which notes that Trudeau's Liberal Party has pledged to focus on humanitarian aid and training missions instead of airstrikes. The White House says the two leaders talked about issues such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and efforts to fight climate change, on which Trudeau plans to work more closely with the US than Harper did. ""Canada's days of being a less-than-enthusiastic actor on the climate-change file are behind us,"" Trudeau said on Tuesday, per the BBC. Trudeau said the tone of the call was ""warm,"" and Obama teased him about his lack of gray hair, reports the CBC. ""He said that I will probably get some quite soon, just like him,"" Trudeau said.

Ex-champs Larry Holmes and Michael Spinks joined the crowd at a north Philly baptist church, where condolence videos were shown from Mike Tyson, Mickey Roarke, and Donald Trump, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Jesse Jackson stirred the crowd by asking them to ""show their love"" for Frazier, who died last week after a battle with liver cancer, reports the AP. At Jackson's call, Ali stood and clapped vigorously for his former rival—his only time standing during the 2-hour service. Otherwise, the former champ was given assistance entering and leaving the church.

"– ""I'm still not even certain as I stand here today about what happened,"" Casey Anthony told the AP earlier this year of the death of her daughter, Caylee, in 2008. Her former defense attorney has a theory as to why that might be. In an interview with LawNewz, Cheney Mason suggests Anthony, who was famously acquitted of murder, suppressed memories associated with her daughter's death and only truly comprehended the event during her trial. ""She didn't go crazy by any means—but [she experienced a] blackout—completely a blackout—of what went on and what happened,"" Mason says. ""She went into what I call 'Casey World.'

He believes it was only when a grief counselor gave testimony in court that Anthony became conscious of Caylee's death. ""She started shaking, and shivering, and she cried,"" Mason said. ""All the time I've known her, and all the times I've seen her, I had never seen this.

"– For the first time in 91 years, thirsty Irish folk can get a pint in a pub on Good Friday. Since 1927, a law has required bars to keep closed on the holiday, which has traditionally seen drinkers gather in homes or on booze-selling trains.

"– Wall Street bankers received smaller bonuses this month, and it is really hard for them.

"– An increasingly common feature that many car manufacturers tout as convenient is actually a very dangerous ""defect,"" according to critics. NBC News—citing stats from a safety group—reports keyless ignitions have caused at least 19 deaths and more than two-dozen ""close calls"" since 2009. A Washington family of six was one of those close calls when their house filled with carbon monoxide in November. The father took his keyless ignition fob out of his van but forgot to turn the engine off. The van continued to run in the family's attached garage until its tank was empty. The president of Safety Research & Strategies, who calls keyless ignition ""an inherent design defect,"" sums up the problem: ""You need the fob to start the vehicle, but it plays absolutely no role in turning it off."" The ability to remove the keyless ignition fob and exit the car with the engine running is especially dangerous in many newer hybrid cars, in which the engine may only come on after the hybrid battery is drained and which often feature ""very quiet, smooth-running engines,"" CNN reports. Many manufacturers are including warning systems or auto-shutoffs in new models to address complaints, but a lawsuit filed against 10 manufacturers is pushing them to recall older models to add additional safety features. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which first highlighted the dangers of keyless ignition back in 2011, tells NBC it should finally have new safety requirements in place next month.","['The ""defect"" alleged in the lawsuit is that, once the car has been started, these systems allow to it continue running even after the fob itself is no longer in the car', 'She wants to force carmakers to fix the millions of vehicles on the road and those that are manufactured in the future', 'The way he sees it, manufacturers changed the relationship between the driver and the key and without warning them of the resulting safety hazard', 'The father told fire officials he parked his Toyota van (equipped with a keyless ignition) in the garage and took the fob with him into the house without remembering to turn off the engine', 'Keyless ignition systems, available on many new cars sold in the United States today, allow drivers to start the car with the press of a button while an electronic ""key fob"" remains in their pocket or purse', 'Many automakers have also added an ""auto-off"" feature to their newer cars and trucks, according to the lawsuilt but have not gone back to older vehicles already on the road and added the software', 'Now, I put the fob in the cup holder between the front seats', 'The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers represents many of the companies named in the lawsuit', 'NHTSA gave two examples: leaving a passenger with heat or air conditioning while the diver runs an errand or keeping the engine running to prevent having to restart the car in a very cold climate', 'Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, blames the carmakers and the government for not taking action to correct a detective design', 'In December 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said keyless vehicles posed a “clear safety problem” and it proposed rules to require an exterior alarm system to warn drivers who walk away from a car that’s still running or capable of starting without the fob being present', '“In the past, you had a traditional metal key that you could only remove from the ignition when you shifted the vehicle into park and the key had been turned to the off position,” Kane explained', 'In most vehicles you can exit with the fob – which most drivers believe is the key – and the engine will keep running until it is out of fuel', 'When NHTSA announced the proposed rule, it said it did not call for an auto-shut-off because there are “many situations in which a driver intends to leave some electrical system or the engine in the vehicle running without his or her presence', 'I pulled my hybrid car into the garage and headed into the house – the key fob was in my jacket pocket – assuming I had turned the car off', 'Another model with keyless fobs – the 2014 and 2015 Ford Lincoln MKS – have an auto-shutoff system that stops the engine after it’s been idling for more than 30 minutes, according to court papers', 'For example, in gasoline-electric hybrid cars, the engine may not be running at all when the driver first gets out of the vehicle', 'You need the fob to start the vehicle, but it plays absolutely no role in turning it off', 'said, in a statement, ""Ford takes the safety of our customers very seriously; the keyless ignition system has proven to be a safe and reliable innovative feature that has been well-received by customers', 'That way, I have to reach for the keys before I get out, which reminds me to hit the ignition button', 'In an email, Wade Newton, director of communications for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said: “The industry continues working with a standards-setting body to further develop best practices', 'Also, so many people are simply hardwired into thinking that when they take the fob out of the car the ignition is off or will turn itself off', 'Luckily, I had to go back into the garage to get something and heard the gasoline engine turn on', 'Three firefighters responding to the emergency call also went to the hospital', ""The current keyless ignition systems have “an inherent design defect,” according to Sean Kane, president of Safety Research & Strategies and a researcher and consultant for plaintiffs' lawyers in consumer-product cases"", 'Newer Volts have software that will shut the car off after a few minutes if the key fob leaves the vehicle', 'The car will not start if the key fob is not detected inside the vehicle', ""The engine could come on later, though, after power in the vehicles' batteries runs low""]"
"– An attack against three black SUNY Albany students that they said was racially motivated has now taken a turn, NBC News reports. Ariel Agudio, Alexis Briggs, and Asha Burwell, all 20-year-old females, say they were on a late-night city bus on Jan. 30 when they were harassed by a group of about a dozen white men and women who hurled racial slurs and assaulted them, per a statement at the time from the university's president. But now, after police interviews with nearly three dozen people who were on what students refer to as the ""drunk bus"" and the review of security footage and passenger cellphone videos, the accusers are the ones to be charged with assault, the Albany Times Union reports.

"– Their daughters were taken away from them; their friends and family were questioned about them molesting children; and on Tuesday—a decade later—AJ and Lisa Demaree received some amount of justice. It started when the Demarees went to a Walmart in Arizona to get more than 100 photos from a 2008 family vacation to San Diego developed, the Washington Post reports. Eight of those photos were of their daughters—ages 1, 4, and 5—playing around at bath time. According to KTVK, a Walmart employee flagged the photos as pornographic and went to the police. The Demarees' daughters were taken away by Child Protective Safety workers and sent to live with their grandparents during the month-long investigation, Courthouse News reports. No charges were filed after judges ruled the photos were harmless pictures like countless parents have taken. In 2011, the Demarees sued the two social workers who took their daughters away without a court order. And on Tuesday—after a string of defeats for the family—a federal appeals court ruled the social workers ""acted unconstitutionally"" and violated the Demarees' rights. “The social workers did not have reasonable cause to believe the children were at risk of serious bodily harm or molestation,” the panel of judges ruled. They found there was no reason the social workers had to rush the children out of the home before first getting a court order. A lower court had dismissed the case against the social workers in 2014 based on qualified immunity. The detective behind the investigation settled with the Demarees earlier.","['“Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Demarees, the social workers did not have reasonable cause to believe the children were at risk of serious bodily harm or molestation,” the panel ruled', '(Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)', 'In Tuesday’s decision, the panel also denied the Demarees’ request to seal the federal court’s summary judgment order to protect the “privacy and innocence of children” and to prevent that material from use in “improper purposes,” like for sexual stimulation', '“The defendants did not suggest that there was any possible harm of the requisite sort to the children before the juvenile courts would reopen after the holiday,” the panel found', 'No evidence of sexual abuse was found during the investigation, and the Demarees sued Wal-Mart, the City of Peoria, the Arizona Attorney General’s Office and the Department of Economic Security', 'The Demarees also sued Walmart, the Arizona Attorney General, and the Peoria Police Department in 2009 over their roles in the girls’ removal from the home', '“The unquantifiable odds that an unsavory individual might find this language titillating does not create a compelling reason for removing it from the public record – especially since the Demarees did not file their complaint under seal, and in fact gave public interviews in which they, themselves, described the photos and the nudity depicted', 'The growth of social networks and photo- and video-sharing sites has facilitated the trade of child pornography, and offenders have found increasingly sophisticated ways to avoid detection, according to the Department of Justice', '“Therefore, viewing the record most favorably to the Demarees, the defendants acted unconstitutionally in taking the three children away from home without judicial authorization', 'When the detective showed up at the couple’s door in August 2008, he brought photocopies of the bath-time photos and pressed the parents about them, according to court documents', 'The lawsuit originally named as defendants the detective, Walmart, the state attorney general and the town of Peoria', 'Police interviewed about three dozen friends, family members and co-workers of the Demarees in the course of their sex-abuse investigation, according to the lawsuit', 'The Walmart employees reported the photos, which contained some nude images of the girls, to the Peoria Police Department, which called in Child Protective Services', 'and Lisa had distributed, or were likely in the future to distribute, nude pictures of their children to anyone,” the panel said', 'and Lisa had distributed, or were likely in the future to distribute, nude pictures of their children to anyone,” the three-judge panel wrote', 'But toward the end of the search of the couple’s house, a Child Protective Services investigator showed up and discussed the case with police', 'The detective settled with

passed since a Wal-Mart employee, who developed the photos, turned them over to Peoria police, causing the couple to lose custody of their children for a month during the investigation', '“[T]he district court order employed clinical, anatomically correct language to briefly describe the nudity depicted in the photographs at issue,” the ruling stated', 'While the exams were being conducted, they got a search warrant and raided the couple’s home, seizing computers, cellphones, undeveloped film and other materials relevant to a child pornography probe, the court wrote', 'A shocking amount of child pornography changes hands every day in the dark corners of the Internet and whatever other channels pedophiles use to traffic sexually exploitative images of minors, as evidenced by the steady drum beat of arrests and sting operations by law enforcement', 'The decision, which came nearly 10 years after the parents’ initial encounter with police, revived the case against the two social workers after a lower court dismissed it in 2014', 'The children’s exams came back normal, showing no signs of abuse, and the girls were returned to their parents', 'But police and social workers launched a full-blown sex abuse investigation, raiding the couple’s home and putting the girls in protective custody for a month while they interviewed dozens of family members and friends about whether the Demarees were child sex offenders', 'While the removal did take place over a holiday weekend when the juvenile court was closed, social workers could have waited for the court to open to seek a warrant', 'After questioning the parents, police took the children in for interviews and medical exams to look for signs of sexual abuse', 'But the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit panel disagreed, ruling in a 47-page opinion that the social workers presented no evidence that the children were in danger of being abused', 'The Demarees sued Pederson and Van Ness in 2011, claiming the social workers’ actions violated the family’s constitutional rights to family unity and companionship', 'Demaree photographed their daughters, who were ages 5, 4, and 1 1/2 at the time, in the bath

children, ages five, four, and one-and-a-half, nude, including their genitalia,” the judges added, “as caring for children of those ages necessitates doing so', 'and Lisa Demaree did not sexually exploit their three daughters, who were ages 5, 4 and 1 at the time, when they took eight photos of them nude in the bathtub', 'As Lisa Belkin, a former New York Times parenting blogger, wrote of the

"– The Golden State Warriors were nearly invincible during the regular season this year, but they fell to Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals. If the Cavs hope to repeat, it looks like they'll have to go through Golden State once again: The Warriors just added free agent Kevin Durant, one of the game's best players, to their roster and thus become the ""heavy favorites"" to win the title next year, reports USA Today. Durant, who will be playing alongside superstar Steph Curry, is expected to sign a two-year deal for $54.3 million, reports ESPN. In a post at the Player's Tribune, the 27-year-old Durant writes that finding a team to help him improve as a player was one factor, ""but I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth.""

The US death toll for August now stands at 53, almost all of whom were killed in southern and eastern Afghanistan, where the Taliban insurgency is strongest, the AP reports. NATO commanders warn that casualties will keep rising as the offensive in the Taliban heartlands around Kandahar continues. America's top commander in Afghanistan says the last of the extra troops being sent to the country will be in place within days. He stressed that the withdrawal of US troops scheduled to begin in July next year will be very gradual and will depend on conditions on the ground.

"– Syria is on board with Russia's proposal to put its chemical weapons under international control, Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told reporters in Moscow today. Moallem earlier met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov today, and says he ""welcomes"" Lavrov's suggestion, CNN reports. John Kerry appeared to suggest something similar today, and so did UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who said he might urge the Security Council to demand Syria turn over its stockpiles for destruction. Ban said that, had chemical weapons been used, it would be a ""terrible crime."" But the statement doesn't necessarily mean Syria will avoid a US strike. The State Department is now walking back Kerry's comments, with a spokeswoman saying he ""was making a rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of Assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied he used."" And writing for the AP, Vladimir Isachenkov observes that Moallem made no mention of timeline or specifics and notes that it remains to be seen whether his comments are truly ""a genuine goodwill

"– Quartz describes it as ""theft-meets-murder-in-a-meal,"" but we think it sounds more like nature's turducken. In a study published Wednesday in Biology Letters, marine biologists from the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Portsmouth in Britain describe a heretofore unobserved method of eating and coined a new term for it: ""kleptopredation."" The concept of kleptoparasitism has been around for a while; it's what hyenas do when they scare off an animal that's just killed its prey in order to steal the meal, Live Science explains. In kleptopredation, on the other hand, an animal waits until its prey has finished eating then just straight-up eats its prey and its prey's prey, which is currently sitting in its prey's belly. The marine biologists observed kleptopredation in a type of sea slug called a nudibranch. The study found that in 14 out of 25 cases, nudibranchs chose to eat hydroid polyps, its normal prey, while the polyps still had a belly full of zooplankton, their typical prey. Because the zooplankton inside the polyps accounts for about half of nudibranchs' diet, researchers believe the sea slugs actually favor consuming plankton rather than the polyps themselves, which nudibranchs appear to be using ""as living fishing nets."" Researchers believe other marine organisms are likely using kleptopredation as well, likely because it increases their nutrition intake. (This sea slug does something incredibly unusual.)","['The nudibranch Cratena peregrina is a common type of bottom-dwelling marine mollusk found in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coastal waters near the Iberian Peninsula, Senegal and the Canary Islands', 'The term “kleptopredation” was introduced to the world by marine biologists from the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Portsmouth in the UK, writing in the journal Biology Letters on Nov', 'This way of catching prey boosts nudibranch intake substantially and is so clever that it seems likely sea slugs aren’t the only kleptopredators, the researchers say', 'In experiments, when presented with a colony of polyps that had just fed and a colony that was ""empty,"" the sea slugs ate twice as many of the polyps that were full of zooplankton', ""It measures about 1 to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimeters) in length, and has a pale body covered with colorful, elongated, fleshy spines called cerata, which help with respiration by increasing the surface area on the upper part of the animal's body"", ""In fact, kleptopredation provides the nudibranchs with enough plankton to account for about half of their diet, overturning previous claims that polyps were the nudibranchs' primary food source, according to the study"", 'That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved', 'Kleptropredation isn’t a crime, though the newly-coined term has a criminal ring, and the act is kind of like theft-meets-murder-in-a-meal', 'In 14 out of 25 cases, the sea slugs chose prey that had just eaten and was full of undigested plankton', 'The goal is to fix all broken links on the web', 'Although those numbers hardly prove the nudibranch’s preferences conclusively, researchers believe that some slugs were trying to get the most bang for their buck, two hunts in one']"
"– That an American female won the Boston Marathon for the first time since 1985 made headlines, but it's the woman who came in second who is grabbing them now. Eyes are shifting to Sarah Sellers, who finished 4 minutes and 10 seconds behind winner Desiree Linden with a time of 2 hours, 44 minutes, 4 seconds. But while Linden is a two-time Olympian, Sellers is a virtual unknown: A promising track career in college hit an early end due to a broken foot her junior year, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. She had only run one marathon prior, in Utah in September, in order to qualify for Boston. The 26-year-old has no sponsors, and did much of her training starting at 4am, before heading to her full-time job as a nurse anesthetist in Tucson, Arizona. CNN picks up this tweet from Kit Fox of Runners World as a sign of just how unexpected her win was: The first question she was asked in a post-race news conference was ""Please introduce yourself. Tell us who you are."" Sellers logs about 85 miles a week, and still relies on Weber State track coach Paul Pilkington for advice. She now walks away with $75,000 in prize money, which she says she and her husband will put toward their student debt. As for that first marathon in Huntsville, Utah, she didn't just win it: She set a course record.","['With rain and strong winds in the forecast for Monday, Pilkington and Sellers spoke over the weekend to dial in her strategy for the race', 'The combination of the wind and rain made conditions difficult, and it was the coldest Boston Marathon in 30 years', 'The coach instructed her to slow her pace slightly in the difficult conditions', 'On the fifth anniversary of the finish line explosions that killed three and wounded hundreds more, Linden and Kawauchi led a field of 30,000 runners through a drenching rain, temperatures in the mid-30s and gusts of up to 32 mph on the 26', 'When Desiree Linden crossed the finish line on Monday morning, there were tears of joy and celebration for the first American woman to win the Boston Marathon in more than three decades', 'She won the 5,000 meters and 10,000-meter title three times each at the Big Sky outdoor championships and won the 5,000 meters twice and the 3,000 meters once at the indoor championships', 'Sellers ran her first marathon in September of last year in Huntsville — and she set a course record in the process', 'Who was Sarah Callister Sellers?

"– Environmentalists are going to hate this one: A State Department review of the controversial Keystone oil pipeline raises no major environmental objections, reports the New York Times. The report concludes that the proposed pipeline from Canada to Texas would not affect global greenhouse gas emissions in a significant way, reports the Washington Post. This doesn't mean the project is now a slam-dunk, but the environmental assessment was seen as one of its biggest remaining hurdles. President Obama has said that he would sign off on the pipeline only if it didn't ""significantly exacerbate"" carbon pollution, and the report seems to satisfy that requirement. So what's next? John Kerry and his State Department now must consider other factors beyond the environment—the economic impact, relations with Canada, etc.—in making a final decision. As one State official tells the Post: The report ""does not answer the broader question about how a decision on this potential pipeline fits in with broader national and international efforts to address climate change and climate priorities or other questions of foreign policy or energy security."" Eight separate agencies have three months to weigh in, reports the Wall Street Journal.","['“After five years and five environmental reviews, time and time again the Department of State analysis has shown that the pipeline is safe for the environment,” said Cindy Schild, the senior manager of refining and oil sands programs at the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the oil industry', 'Williamson/The Washington Post', 'The $5', 'The U', '“Given the anticipated outlook of oil prices and the cost of development, no single project will likely affect the rate of extraction,” said a senior State Department official, who asked not to be named under the ground rules imposed by the department', '“In what could be perceived as eagerness to please the oil industry and Canadian government, the State Department is issuing this report amidst an ongoing investigation into conflicts of interest, and lying, by its contractor,” said Erich Pica, the president of Friends of the Earth', 'Though the report acknowledged that tapping the Canadian oil sands for the pipeline would produce more greenhouse gases, the assessment also said that blocking the project would not prevent development of those resources', 'Environmental activists fiercely oppose it, arguing that the pipeline could leak, would accelerate development of the greenhouse gas-intensive oil sands in Alberta and would increase the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels', 'The State Department is expected to shortly release the results of an inspector general’s investigation into the preparation of an earlier draft of the environmental impact report', 'The State Department report “includes a range of estimates of the project’s climate impacts, and that information will now need to be closely evaluated by Secretary Kerry and other relevant agency heads in the weeks ahead,” White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said in a statement Friday', 'McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration', 'The investigation was ordered after an environmental group obtained documents indicating that some consultants for the firm that wrote the draft report had previously done work for TransCanada, the company seeking to build the pipeline', '“It is hard to imagine how the president could justify rejection without turning the United States into a poster child for what the energy industry terms ‘above-ground’ risk,” said Robert McNally, president of the Rapidan Group consulting firm', 'Jones, the State Department official, said the report “presents considerable analysis, but it does not answer the broader question about how a decision on the proposed project would fit into the broader national and international efforts to address climate change or other questions of foreign policy or energy security', 'The State Department’s report includes 11 volumes of analysis on how the proposed pipeline would affect heavy-crude extraction in Canada’s oil sands and reaches the same conclusion as its draft report did in March: No single infrastructure project will alter the course of oil development in Alberta', 'Oil industry officials welcomed the fact that the department had affirmed the idea that the pipeline decision did not have a major climate impact', ""WASHINGTON—An Obama administration analysis of the Keystone XL pipeline said it probably wouldn't alter the amount of oil ultimately removed from Canadian oil sands, boosting the pipeline's backers by suggesting it would have little impact on climate change"", 'But the company is still waiting for a State Department permit for the 1,179-mile northern leg that would carry heavy crude from Canada into Montana and run to the small town of Steele City, Neb', 'The oil sands deposit is massive — and so is the pipeline The Keystone XL would tap into the second biggest petroleum reserves on Earth', 'The State Department has cited rail as a reason why blocking the pipeline would not slow oil sands development, although a spate of oil train derailments — including a derailment Friday in southeast Mississippi — has highlighted the dangers of that alternative', 'The release of the long-awaited report is one of the last steps before the up-or-down decision by President Barack Obama, who must juggle conflicting demands from supporters', 'The State Department concluded in its final environmental assessment issued Friday that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would be unlikely to alter global greenhouse gas emissions, but officials cautioned that they are still weighing whether the project would meet the test of President Obama’s broader climate strategy', '“This is the most scrutinized pipeline in the nation’s history,” said Brigham A', 'The EPA has questioned

oil industry applauded the review', '“We’re very pleased with the release and about being able to move to this next stage of the process,” said Russ Girling, chief executive of TransCanada', 'The new State Department analysis took into account the growing global demand for oil and the rapidly growing practice of moving oil by rail in areas where pipelines have not been built', 'The report said that “the proposed Project is unlikely to significantly affect the rate of extraction in oil sands areas (based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios)', '“We’re taking the inclusion of that scenario as good news,” said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, director of international programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council', 'The report concludes that crude extracted from the oil sands results in 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than the average barrel of crude used in the United States but only 2 percent to 10 percent more than the heavy crude it would likely replace at Gulf Coast refineries', 'State Department issues an environmental review of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, that played down the impact it would have on climate change', '“At the end of the day, there’s a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,” said Robert McNally, an energy consultant who was a senior energy and economic adviser to President George W', 'If investigators determine a conflict of interest in the preparation of that draft, the State Department may have to conduct a new environmental review', 'The new State Department report concludes that the process used for producing the oil — by extracting what are called tar sands or oil sands from the Alberta forest — creates about 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional oil', 'Larry Schweiger, the president of the National Wildlife Federation, said: “This is a large source of carbon that’s going to be

"– Jill Stein's recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania just got a major new supporter: the Clinton campaign. NBC News reports the campaign announced Saturday it will participate in the recount in Wisconsin and possible recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania to make sure the process is ""fair"" for everyone. ""We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted,"" campaign lawyer Marc Elias says in a post on Medium. The campaign was spurred to get involved in the recount partly based on reports that Russians hacked the DNC, tried to hack voter registration databases, and spread fake news about the election, according to the Washington Post. But that doesn't mean the Clinton campaign expects anything to change. Elias says they've had experts combing over the results for weeks and haven't found any ""evidence of manipulation."" And he notes that even in the closest of the three states, Michigan, Trump's lead ""well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount."" He adds that the Clinton campaign didn't initiate the recount efforts itself and had absolutely no plans to do so but now must monitor them ""on principle."" Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon denies that Elias' post means the campaign isn't accepting the results of the election. ""We see no evidence of tampering so far,"" he tells the Post. ""Not sure what you could point to to suggest there is anything here that calls the results into question.""","['Alex Halderman, one of the academics reportedly involved, later wrote on Medium that the deviations were “probably not” the result of a cyberattack but that “the only way to know whether a cyberattack changed the result is to closely examine the available physical evidence — paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania', 'Elias acknowledged that ""the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states — Michigan — well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount,"" but he said the Clinton campaign felt it was ""important, on principle,"" to take part in and monitor the process', 'In a Medium post, Clinton campaign lawyer Marc Elias said that the campaign had received “hundreds of messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something, anything, to investigate claims that the election results were hacked and altered in a way to disadvantage Secretary Clinton,” especially in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where the “combined margin of victory for Donald Trump was merely 107,000 votes', '“The post says we would not have sought the recount on our own, that we see no evidence of tampering so far, and acknowledge the margin in Michigan, which is the tightest of the three, exceeds the largest deficit ever overcome in a recount,” Fallon wrote to The Washington Post', 'In the coming days, we will continue to perform our due diligence and actively follow all further activities that are to occur prior to the certification of any election results', 'It could, however, delay the final results for weeks and provide fuel to the tens of thousands of upset Americans who\'ve taken to the streets in protest against Trump\'s win, declaring that the real estate mogul is ""not my president', '“The people have spoken and the election is over,” the

compared to poll-books, provisional ballots are resolved, and all of the math is double checked from election night', '” But because of the margin of victory — and because of the degree of apparent

"– Miley Cyrus and her tongue, which apparently has serious trouble staying in her mouth, are on the cover of Rolling Stone. It's difficult to pick just one disturbing thing from the accompanying article, so we'll run down the top 7 for you: Cyrus starts the interview by getting two new tattoos, ""Rolling"" on the bottom of one foot and ""$tone"" on the bottom of the other. Why? Because she wanted to do something fun with the reporter. ""I thought about going to play laser tag,"" she explains, ""but laser tag sucks."" After the tattoos are complete, she FaceTimes with the tattoo artist's 5th-grade daughter. ""Hey! I hear you make a face like me!"" she says, and they both stick their tongues out at each other. ""Yay!"" Miley says. Later, while skydiving with the reporter, a grandmother instructs her, ""Stick your tongue out!"" Steve Carell lives down the street from her, and ""he always gives me the stank-eye because I drive so fast,"" Miley says. ""The other day I was trying to reverse and I almost hit a thousand things, and I was getting nervous because I could see him going—"" and here she crosses her arms and sighs loudly to demonstrate. ""Honestly, that was our MTV version,"" she says of her controversial VMAs performance. ""We could have even gone further, but we didn't. I thought that's what the VMAs were all about! It's not the Grammys or the Oscars. You're not supposed to show up in a gown, Vanna White-style."" (Rolling Stone calls this a diss on Taylor Swift.) Later, she says, ""I wasn't trying to be sexy. If I was trying to be sexy, I could have been sexy. I can dance a lot better than I was dancing."" She and Kanye West are ""homies"" (her word; she uses it quite a bit in the article, and also ""homeboy""). After the VMAs, she mentioned to him that a pair of her swanky slippers were falling apart, and he bought her five more. In her ""Wrecking Ball"" video, she cries at one point. ""That was real. My dog just passed away,"" she says in a tone Rolling Stone describes as ""proud."" ""I'm still kind of a semi-nudist, because I never had clothes on"" as a kid, she says. That tendency was certainly on display during the Rolling Stone photo shoot; the pictures include topless Miley in a shower, topless Miley in a pool, and topless Miley leaning out a sliding glass door.

"– More than 25 years ago, Gary Hart's presidential campaign came to a screeching halt after a Miami Herald article investigating his supposed extramarital affairs and a photo of Hart with 29-year-old model Donna Rice sitting on his lap were published. Now, after years of speculation—and refusal by the Herald political reporter to ID the caller who initially filled him in on the photo—a Florida woman admits she's the one who phoned the Herald and also let the paper know that Rice was going to visit Hart in DC, the New York Times reports. Rice herself tells the Times that she thought former friend Dana Weems was somehow behind the leak, along with another pal, Lynn Armandt—and when Times writer Matt Bai called Weems, she reportedly sighed, then replied, ""Yeah. That was me."" (She also claims Armandt was standing next to her when she made the call, listening in.) The Herald story, photo, and ensuing scandal forced Hart to drop out of the running for the Democratic nomination (though the Washington Post disputes Bai's assertion that ""Hart was as close to a lock for the nomination—and likely the presidency—as any challenger of the modern era""). Weems, who has health issues from multiple sclerosis and now sells raincoats online, says Hart was actually enchanted with her—not Rice—and that Rice pursued Hart because she wanted to be famous, while Hart's philandering behavior (especially the thought of him getting away with it and becoming president) made Weems ""sick to her stomach."" She also tells the Times that she can't believe her secret has been safe all these years and that she was ""sorry to ruin [Hart's] life. I was young. I didn't know it would be that way."" (Read the entire Times story here.)","['The discovery of Hart’s supposed challenge, which the Herald reporters took from the advance copy of The Times Magazine on Saturday night and inserted at the end of their Sunday blockbuster — so that the two articles, referring to the same quote, appeared on newsstands simultaneously — probably eased any reservations the editors in Miami might have had about pushing the story into print before they had a chance to identify Rice and try to talk to her', 'Proximity to power and the information and insight derived from having it was the currency of the trade', 'To Hart\'s main point -- that The Herald had refused to interview ""the very people who could have given them the facts"" -- Fiedler told of the entreaties to Hart on Saturday night for the opportunity to speak with his acquaintances', 'According to the writer Richard Ben Cramer, who chronicled these events in his classic campaign book, “What It Takes,” Hart made a show of writing down the license-plate number in full view of the two reporters; The Herald didn’t mention this detail, but it did report that Hart seemed “agitated” and appeared to yell over his shoulder at someone on the other side of the street as he walked away', 'The changing role of political media in the United States is an interesting and important topic, and it needs to be understood in the context of the immutable and anomalous details of particular examples, including the saga of Gary Hart', 'He put the question point-blank to Hart: Had the senator had sex with the woman in the townhouse?', 'In his

the park to avoid recognition', 'If you were an aspiring journalist born in the 1950s, when the baby boom was in full swing, then you entered the business at almost exactly the moment when Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post — portrayed by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in the cinematic version of their first book, “All the President’s Men” — were becoming not just the most celebrated reporters of their day but very likely the wealthiest and most famous journalists in American history (with the possible exception of Walter Cronkite )', 'It was The Washington Post

Herald that could undo it all', 'He said that the house had been under surveillance and that he had observed Hart with the woman the night before, in Hart’s car', 'He was “serious” about the sentiment, all right, but only to the extent that a man who had been twice separated from his wife and dated other women over the years — with the full knowledge of his friends in the press corps and

for the same impromptu party at which Hart and his pal Billy Broadhurst, a Louisiana lawyer and lobbyist, met up with Rice, but in her version of events, Hart was hitting on her, not on Rice, and he was soused and pathetic, and she wanted nothing to do with him, but still he followed her around the boat, hopelessly enthralled', 'Fiedler readily acknowledged that the order of events pertaining to the “follow me around” quote had since become jumbled in the public mind, and his expression was genuinely regretful', 'He glanced up the street, and the series of coincidences that drove the story continued', 'But she had come to believe that Armandt was in cahoots with another friend of theirs in Miami — a woman named Dana Weems — who was on the boat for a party but didn’t join them on the cruise to Bimini and thus escaped notice in contemporary accounts of the scandal', ""Possible comings and goings through the rear alley garage -- out of the sight of reporters for part of the time --

do exactly the kind of surveillance they had undertaken the night before', 'As America continued to debate the Equal Rights Amendment for women into the 1980s, younger liberals — the same permissive generation that ushered in the sexual revolution and free love — were suddenly apt to see adultery as a kind of political betrayal, and one that needed to be exposed', 'He said it was a coincidence that Hart and the blond ended up together in Washington over the weekend, something Hart himself and she would contradict later', 'McGee, sensing he had been made, turned on his heels and ran, bumping into Fiedler, who, being the only reporter on the scene whom Hart actually knew from the campaign plane, had disguised himself in a tracksuit and was pretending to jog around every so often', 'Back then, Hart was as close to a lock for the nomination — and likely the presidency — as any challenger of the modern era', 'But somewhere in that period, the tide of the debate seemed to turn and run

"– Some 14,000 life jackets discarded by refugees entering Europe via the Greek island of Lesbos now adorn the six pillars of Berlin's landmark Konzerthaus concert hall. It's the work of Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei, Quartz reports, who has been a vocal critic of Europe's handling of the refugee crisis. Since January, more that 84,000 migrants have arrived in Europe, according to the International Organization for Migration. Of those, at least 410 have drowned or are missing. More than 1 million migrants made the journey to Europe in 2015, with the vast majority of them coming by sea. More than 3,700 people died crossing the Mediterranean last year, per Quartz. Officials in Lesbos say they gave the life jackets to Ai, CNN reports. The artist has spent a lot of time on the island in the last year—even setting up a studio there—documenting the dangerous journey refugees make as they flee conflict and poverty. “As an artist, I have to relate to humanity’s struggles,"" he tells the AP in an earlier interview. ""I never separate these situations from my art.""

Vergara wore a Zuhair Murad Couture gown sans veil.

"– It's not a party until something gets broken, and it's not a political party until someone gets arrested. This spring's GOP primary battle is now a party, as GOP leaders and enthusiastic supporters squared off in one of Missouri's largest caucuses yesterday, reports ABC News. At least two people were arrested and a police helicopter was called in, after organizers and enthusiastic attendees in St. Charles County fought heatedly over the event's proceedings—in addition to a caucus' usual squabbling over rules and results, Ron Paul supporters apparently insisted on filming the caucus, despite that being against the rules. “It’s like the Hatfields and the McCoys around here,” said one GOP operative. Caucuses weren't much better in the rest of the state, with organizers using words like ""bloodbath"" and ""mass hysteria"" to describe them, reports the LA Times. But at least most of the caucuses were able to function. In Clay County, organizers threatened to remove rowdy Paul supporters, but did not actually do so. “It could have been messier,” said one committee chairman. “We were expecting a large contingent of Ron Paul voters.” Missouri's primary in February was nonbinding, and the caucus process of choosing delegates is relatively complicated and layered.","['Charles GOP said in an official statement that it still plans to send delegates to the congressional-district and state conventions, but none were elected at the caucus on Saturday', '""It turned into a little food fight within the caucus, between the caucus chairman trying to control the caucus and certain elements, I guess with Ron Paul, trying to be heard,"" said Tom Kipers, a former chairman of the St', 'Charles, political blogger John Combest tweeted that order broke down in the first 10 seconds of the caucus, with Santorum, Romney and Paul groups butting heads in a “mass hysteria” over how to proceed', 'The state’s Republicans first had to wade through a widely expected political pileup in order to complete the next stage of Missouri’s convoluted nomination process', 'The county elected a slate of 48 Paul-supporting delegates and five who back Romney, the local GOP chairman said', 'He was waving his thermos at the crowd that had assembled to caucus at the Westminster Christian Academy, where Santorum had stopped by to speak to a few dozen fans and a handful of placard-wielding Mitt Romney supporters in this St', 'Paul supporters, meanwhile prevailed in Boone, a mid-sized county that encompasses Columbia and the University of Missouri', '""It\'s like the Hatfields and the McCoys around here,"" St', 'The caucusing -- in which Missourians picked the delegates who will elect the delegates who will cast their votes for a Republican nominee, the layers of it all a bit like a giant political nesting doll -- went smoothly in some places, and more, um, bloodbath-like in others', 'The Kansas City Star reported that in Clay County, “arguments between Paul supporters and others became so intense the caucus chairman threatened to have voters removed by force', 'An off-duty police officer, hired as security, eventually filed a trespassing complaint against the Paul supporters and notified on-duty police in the area municipality of St', 'At the state convention, in a spirit of reconciliation according to Kipers, they were reinstated and the officials who had barred them were themselves barred for having done so', ""Louis and one of the state's largest GOP counties, Paul supporters sought to elect their own chairman and adopt their own rules when proceedings opened - both of which are part of standard caucus rules and procedure"", 'Call it what you want, but a day of electoral uncertainty in Missouri has proven what many already knew: The Show-Me State won’t be showing its cards in the Republican president-making game any time soon', 'Santorum supporters prevailed in Chesterfield, one of the largest caucus sites in St', 'It\'s too early to tell which candidate performed best, and the Missouri GOP said anecdotal evidence indicates that very few counties chose to ""bind"" their delegates to any particular candidate', ""Instead, caucusers chose first-tier delegates to Missouri's congressional-district and state conventions, who will then elect and allocate 49 of the state's 52 national delegates""]"
"– Joseph Kabila has been president of the Democratic Republic of Congo since 2001. His second—and constitutionally mandated final—term ended Monday at midnight. Only the 45-year-old Kabila refused to step down. Here's what you need to know: With Kabila refusing to relinquish power, violence is breaking out. The Guardian reports 20 people were killed as protesters clashed with security officials. Oddly, Kabila's chief diplomat tells Newsweek that Kabila would be guilty of treason if he stepped down. The country failed to hold an election in November as planned, and the diplomat says the constitution requires Kabila to stay in power until a successor is elected. But the ruling party states that won't happen until April 2018 at the earliest. The New York Times reports it might not be desire for power that's keeping Kabila from ceding the presidency but rather a fear he'll lose his fortune in the process. Investigators say Kabila has stolen millions in public assets through ""dubious mining rights sales"" and ""possible money-laundering schemes."" In the months leading up to the end of Kabila's second term, the Washington Post did an extremely rare public opinion poll in the Democratic Republic of Congo, finding that 81% of people don't want the constitution changed to give Kabila a third term and 74% want him to step down by the end of the year. The Guardian notes that the current situation isn't rare for the country. The Democratic Republic of Congo hasn't had a peaceful transfer of power since gaining independence 56 years ago and is facing what could be an especially violent period. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of Congo's former colonial ruler—Belgium—says it will ""re-examine"" its relationship with the country in the wake of what some are describing as a coup by Kabila,

"– For Karl the hornbill, the pickings were slim. With only half a bottom beak, the black-plumed bird at Washington's National Zoo couldn't eat anything smaller than a mouse. And to do that, he had to sort of scrape his beak along the ground while tilting his head at just the right angle. Lacking teeth, Abyssinian ground hornbills scoop up morsels, which they flip in the air and swallow whole. Experts puzzled over how to help the 27-year-old bird eat, the Washington Post reports, but ill-fitting prosthetics kept falling off. Experts at the Smithsonian Institution then came up with a novel idea: Reaching into their vaults, they found a hornbill skull circa 1933 to use as a model, then turned to a 3D printer to build Karl a shiny new beak. In a fascinating video that outlines the process, specialists crafted the new appendage in stages with the help of the printer. Then they glued it onto a prone Karl. ""Fingers crossed it stays on,"" one of them says. Native to Africa, hornbills are about the size of a wild turkey. Males have blue and red coloring around their throats and long eyelashes they can flutter at mates they choose exclusively. For Karl's sake, his keepers hope with a full belly, he will be better able to keep up the latter end of the bargain. Vet James Steeil says the hope is that the high-tech prosthetic ""will provide Karl with a better avenue to eat for himself and hopefully propagate the species.""

Christine Morgan of the Butterfly Foundation, which offers support for eating disorders, adds the film's ""graphic representations"" raise ""a very real risk of copycat behavior,"" per the Huffington Post. She wants to see Netflix add a warning to the film. Kristina Saffran of Project Heal, which helps fund treatment for people suffering from eating disorders, offers a different take. ""Triggers are everywhere in eating disorder recovery,"" she tells the Washington Post, adding ""it would have been impossible to make any sort of film that didn't have the potential to trigger somebody who is struggling."" Per the AP, Claire Mysko of the National Eating Disorders Association notes eating disorders are a ""serious public health issue"" that will affect 30 million Americans in their lifetimes, so ""having eating disorders discussed on a national platform like this is really important."" The film isn't just important, but also really good, adds Tomris Laffly at Film Journal International. It's ""refreshingly well-considered,"" portrays eating disorders as ""addiction-related mental and physical ailments that rob people of a normal life,"" and is ""ultimately optimistic,"" she writes. But specific concerns have been made about Collins, who has admitted to struggling with eating disorders and had to lose weight for the role of Ellen, reports USA Today. Collins, however, says the weight loss was necessary ""to tell this story"" and done safely with oversight from a nutritionist, filmmakers, and her mother.","['Given the school of thinking that approaches treating eating disorders as treating addiction, you can draw parallels between the makeshift rituals and tightknit closeness of the community portrayed in To the Bone to that of 28 Days',

"– A new post on a forum popular with ISIS militants claims the two Japanese captives are running out of time. The ""countdown has begun"" for the group to kill Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa unless Japan pays $200 million in ransom, according to the post, published today. Japan says it's analyzing the message as it attempts to contact the men's captors through local tribes, though ISIS' original 72-hour deadline has expired, the AP reports. ""The situation remains severe, but we are doing everything we can to win the release of the two Japanese hostages,"" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga says. Meanwhile, Goto's mother, Junko Ishido, is pleading with the government to save her son, who ""only went to rescue his friend,"" Reuters reports. Documents show Japan considered a military strike on ISIS militants but found that one would be outside its legal realm. A Japanese journalist who tried to free Yukawa in September and an expert on Islamic law said yesterday they have an ISIS contact and were willing to negotiate with the group, the AP reports; it isn't clear if Japan was agreeable. Finding the captors would be no easy task: Experts reviewing the hostage video—which seems to show Goto and Yukawa in jumpsuits in the desert—suspect it was actually shot in a studio, the AP notes.

"– It's 40 days and 40 nights of ... beer? A Canadian man is giving it a shot for Lent, reports the National Post. Chris Schryer, 33, has sworn off solid food in favor of a calorie-laden brew called dopplebock.

Schryer is about halfway through his unusual fast, which he is writing about at his TorontoBeerBlog. “Without being dramatic, it definitely is not fun; it’s challenging,"" he says. ""Every meal time there’s challenge."" Generally, Schryer has a bottle for breakfast, another for lunch, and a larger one at dinner.

Schryer is a devout Anglican, and in a Huffington Post column, he explains that he sees Lent as a time of spiritual ""training.""

"– On the one hand, it's a fairly expected announcement: On the heels of Russia's confirmation of a missile deal with Syria, President Bashar al-Assad has confirmed that the initial shipment of S-300 air defense missiles was in fact delivered to his country, with the second portion of the order arriving today. But Assad's statement, made in an interview to air today on Al Manar TV, and reaction to it bear some noteworthy aspects: As the New York Times points out, Al Manar is a channel run by Hezbollah, and that choice of delivery method, in the Times' view, only enhances ""the confrontational atmosphere"" of Assad's statements. The interview was actually taped on Tuesday, according to a Beirut source. That same day, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon firmly denied a weapons delivery had occurred, warning Russia that such a move could spur Israel to retaliate. ""If, by some fortune, [the missiles] arrive in Syria, we will know what to do,"" he said. Per the AP, the next day, Syria's foreign minister said in a TV interview that Damascus ""will retaliate immediately"" if Israel strikes Syrian soil again. (Reuters notes Israel has thus far launched three airstrikes against Syria in a bid to stop weapons transfers.) But the AP notes that with the S-300 system in hand, the Israeli air force's abilities are curtailed, as the S-300s will allow Syria to counter airstrikes launched from foreign airspace. What exactly are the S-300 systems capable of? A second Israeli minister says they have a range of up to 185 miles; the AP, which puts their range at 125 miles, reports they're able to track and strike multiple targets simultaneously.

DioGuardi has reportedly been fired, and the show will return to its three-judge format...with Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler in talks to join the last remaining judge, Randy Jackson, reports Gossip Cop. All follow-up reports seem to agree Lopez is in, with one source telling People the deal is done and Lopez “is excited about it.” Deadline notes that DeGeneres’ exit is no surprise, as she was complaining months ago that producers “couldn’t control Cowell,” an insider says, and was never accepted by the audience or other judges.

"– A big change could be in store for what's considered Europe's most restrictive nation on abortion. The Irish people are voting Friday in a referendum that could see the removal of a near-total constitutional ban on abortion, enacted by another referendum 35 years ago with support from the Roman Catholic church. The vote to repeal or keep the eighth amendment—which views ""the right to life of the unborn"" as equal to that of the mother and therefore prohibits abortion in cases of rape, incest, and fatal fetal abnormalities—is expected to be close. Opinion polls showed ""repeal"" voters slightly ahead but up to 20% of voters undecided, reports the Guardian, noting the votes of thousands of Irish expatriates returning home for the referendum ""could be significant."" Prime Minister Leo Varadkar calls the vote a ""once in a generation decision,"" noting it could be another 35 years before abortion is revisited. Should voters choose repeal, a move backed by UN Human Rights Committee, the government will introduce legislation allowing unrestricted abortion via pill during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with abortions also permitted until the 23rd week in cases of fatal fetal abnormality or when a woman's health is at risk. Any woman seeking an abortion would need to wait three days after meeting with a doctor, reports the Washington Post. Currently, some 3,500 Irish women travel abroad to get abortions each year, and though seeking or providing an abortion can carry a 14-year prison term, another 2,000 are believed to illegally procure abortion pills. The vote result is expected Saturday afternoon.","['In its observations to the Committee on AM’s claims, Ireland said that the country’s constitutional and legislative framework reflected “the nuanced

"– Passengers aboard a Bronx city bus last week might have been surprised to learn that a major drug deal was taking place in front of them. And as the Daily News reports, it was the driver himself who ended up in handcuffs. The tale of the unusual bust involving 8 pounds of heroin worth $3 million began the morning of April 17, when customs officials at JFK busted a traveler from Africa with the drugs in his Samsonite. He agreed to proceed with his deal under the watch of federal agents and called the cell number he had been provided, reports the Smoking Gun. His contact turned out to be a 50-year-old bus driver for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority named Francis Abankwa. The traveler boarded Abankwa's bus in the Bronx with the drugs and stayed right through until the end of the route, remaining on board while all the other passengers exited. After he and Abankwa exited and started heading toward Abankwa's car, the feds swooped in for the arrest. Both face felony narcotics conspiracy charges, and Abankwa is looking at 10 years in prison if convicted. On the bright side, notes New York, ""at least they let Abankwa finish his route.""","['At the bus’s final stop, all remaining passengers exited the vehicle--with the exception of Traore, who stayed on as Abankwa returned to an MTA bus depot', 'After a series of phone calls, Traore arranged to meet up with Francis Abankwa, a 50-year-old Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus driver, “at 6:51 PM at the bus stop at Grand Concourse and East Tremont in the Bronx, New York', 'Along with collecting fares and making stops, an on-duty New York City bus driver directed an international narcotics courier to board his coach at a stop in the Bronx so that he could take possession of nearly eight pounds of heroin that had just been smuggled into the country, according to prosecutors', 'After leaving the bus, the men were walking towards Abankwa’s car when federal investigators swooped in and arrested the bus driver, who “was in possession” of the Samsonite luggage', '” Traore boarded Abankwa’s bus with a Samsonite roller bag in tow, according to a court filing', '5 kilos of heroin in his Samsonite roller bag, Traore confessed to his role in a smuggling plot and agreed to cooperate with a federal sting operation']"
"– Childbirth is generally accepted to be a painful experience, but a new study indicates that some of the pain may come at the hands of health care workers. Researchers analyzed 65 studies from 34 countries (one study was conducted in NYC in 1999; other locations included Cuba, England, Australia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ghana) and found that women were mistreated across income levels and locations. The mistreatment ran the gamut, from things like neglect, a refusal to provide pain meds, poor communication, or a lack of respect for a woman's preferred birth position, to the extreme: slapping, pinching, gags, threatened beatings, and verbal abuse. One study, conducted in Tanzania, recorded four self-reported instances of rape and three of sexual abuse. While the researchers write that their study provides ""a comprehensive, evidence-based typology of the mistreatment of women during childbirth,"" the New York Times notes it does not calculate any sort of global estimate of abuse, and some figures produced by the individual studies themselves are wide-ranging: 28% of women in that Tanzania study reported abuse, while 98% did in a study out of Nigeria. The paper observes that such abuse can spur women to steer clear of hospitals, ""undermin[ing] international goals of reducing deaths during childbirth."" In a 2014 statement on the issue, the WHO wrote, ""Adolescents, unmarried women, women of low socio-economic status, women from ethnic minorities, migrant women, and women living with HIV are particularly likely to experience disrespectful and abusive treatment."" (This woman has an extreme birth story.)","['Moving forward, the typology presented in this review can be used in the development and validation of indicators and tools to measure the prevalence of the mistreatment of women during childbirth, to identify interventions to reduce this mistreatment, and to inform efforts to develop global consensus on the definition of the mistreatment of women

accepting the poor treatment of women as the norm [ 13 , 91 ]', 'Moreover, they indicate that, although the mistreatment of women during delivery in health facilities often occurs at the level of the

example, slapping or pinching during delivery); sexual abuse; verbal abuse such as harsh or rude language; stigma and discrimination based on age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or medical conditions; failure to meet professional standards of care (for example, neglect during delivery); poor rapport between women and providers, including ineffective communication, lack of supportive care, and loss of autonomy; and health system conditions and constraints such as the lack of the resources needed to provide women with privacy', 'As such, this systematic review builds upon the work

can occur at the level of the interaction between the woman and provider, a complex range of systemic failures at the levels of the health facility and health system contribute to its occurrence,

"– The last time a senior UN official stepped foot in North Korea was in October 2011. That changed Tuesday, with United Nations undersecretary-general for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman's visit to the country. The BBC reports Pyongyang proffered the invitation in September but confirmation of the visit didn't come until last week. Feltman, who is not slated to meet with Kim Jong Un, will meet with foreign minister Ri Yong Ho (who infamously called President Trump a ""barking dog"") to discuss ""issues of mutual interest and concern."" That ostensibly includes North Korea's nuclear weapons program. The Wall Street Journal reports the UN Security Council has had no discussion regarding Feltman's visit, but the paper quotes a council diplomat as saying, ""The trip is more of a way to try to do some help and to test the waters."" Feltman, the former US ambassador to Lebanon, per Quartz, and the highest ranking American in the UN, made a pit stop in Beijing along the way, ""no doubt interested to hear what, if anything, came out of China's latest talks with the North Korean regime,"" per the BBC. The Guardian reports a UN rep added that Feltman will also ""meet with the United Nations country team and members of the diplomatic corps, as well as visit UN project sites""—six agencies and 50 UN staffers are present in the country, where they provide food, agricultural, and health aid.

"– Parents in King’s Park, Scotland, are outraged over a local school’s suggestion that the way their children dress might attract sexual predators. In the wake of the arrest of an alleged local predator, the school has sent out a letter telling parents that “an appropriate school uniform (eg school trousers, knee-length school skirt etc) protects children from being targeted by sexual predator,” according to the BBC. “We must do all we can to keep our children safe,” the letter continues. “A modest school uniform is more appropriate than fashion skirts, trousers or tops.” It then names a department store where approved items can be purchased. The Scottish Parent Teacher Council has objected to the letter, saying it “implies that young people are in some way responsible for the activities of pedophiles.” Or, as Jezebel puts it: “Pedophiles don’t lose interest in children when they put on a looser pair of pants.”","['She added: ""Many parents - and indeed young people themselves - are keen to have a dress code in school which requires everyone in the school community to dress in a way which is appropriate for a working environment', 'The letter advised parents to buy ""appropriate"" school uniforms from a list of approved items at Marks and Spencer', 'McCluskey pleaded guilty to 49 charges stretching back to 2003, including lewd and libidinous practices and behaviour, at the High Court in Glasgow in February', 'In the letter to parents, the school states: ""We believe that an appropriate school uniform (eg school trousers, knee-length school skirt etc) protects children from being targeted by sexual predators', ""The advice to families of children at King's Park Secondary School in Glasgow was sent out as part of new guidelines on dress codes"", '""If there is evidence of activity by a paedophile in the area, then police and parents should be informed and involved', '""There is recent evidence in the south of Glasgow of adults photographing school girls in short skirts and school girls/boys in tight trousers, then grooming them through the internet', 'There are legitimate reasons to make children wear school uniforms, such as lessening distractions or providing the school with a preppy panache, but warding off predators is not one of them', 'The Scottish Parent Teacher Council said the letter to parents was not needed and unwise', 'There is recent evidence in the south of Glasgow of adults photographing school girls in short skirts and school girls/boys in tight trousers, then grooming them through the internet', ""The BBC reports that in response to this troubling case, King's Park Secondary School sent a letter to parents about a new dress code"", '""It implies that young people are in some way responsible for the activities of paedophiles, which is an extremely dangerous argument and one which has echoes of the comments sometimes made around rapists and women\'s dress', 'The former nurse posed as a 14-year-old girl to entice children to perform sex acts in front of web cameras']"

"– It's been 40 years since a violent serial burglar, rapist, and killer started to terrorize Northern California, but the FBI this week announced there is a new, concerted push to find the so-called ""East Area Rapist."" Described as a white male about 5-foot-10 with blond or light brown hair, an athletic build, and possible training in military or law enforcement, the suspect is likely between 60 and 75 years old and has been linked to at least 52 sexual assaults in the Bay Area and Sacramento County in the 1970s and '80s. The bureau is offering a $50,000 reward for information that helps identify him and is launching a national campaign that includes billboards. No crimes have been connected to the man since 18-year-old Janelle Cruz was raped and bludgeoned to death in her family's home in Irvine, Calif., in 1986, reports the Los Angeles Times. And yet, ""We believe he's alive,"" says Sgt. Paul Belli of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau. ""There's no reason to believe he's not alive."" After serial killer Richard Ramirez became known as the ""Night Stalker"" in the mid-'80s when he terrorized the Los Angeles area, the East Area Rapist took on the moniker ""Original Night Stalker"" and has stumped investigators ever since. But DA Anne Marie Schubert, who was 12 and in East Sacramento during the first attacks, says memories haven't faded, reports the Sacramento Bee. ""In essence, a community was taken hostage,"" she says. The suspect is linked to more than 175 crimes since he attacked a woman in 1976, including 45 rapes and 12 homicides. He's known for targeting couples, tying them up, and taking jewelry or coins. (Some think America's first serial killer went on to become Jack the Ripper.)","['This enables investigators to quickly exclude innocent parties, and the public should not hesitate to provide information—even if it is the name or address of an individual who resided in the areas of the crimes—as many parties will be quickly excluded by a simple, non-invasive test', 'Did they live in one of the areas of criminal activity and remember someone in the area who matches the physical description of the subject or may have been known to spend a considerable amount of time in the areas?', 'Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office, and Contra Costa Sheriff’s Department held a press conference to announce the launch of a reward and national campaign to help identify the East Area Rapist/Golden State Killer, a violent serial burglar, rapist, and murderer who terrorized multiple communities in California throughout the 1970s and 1980s', 'The following is a listing of local law enforcement agencies who have investigated a crime believed to have been committed by the subject and the number of crimes in their jurisdictions:', 'During the commission of the homicides, the subject tied up both victims, raped the female victim, and then murdered the couple', 'Have they discovered a hidden collection of items among the belongings of a friend or family member—notably coins and jewelry—as described on the FBI webpage about the crimes?', 'The public can play an active role in helping law enforcement find the subject by sharing links to the website and official social media content', 'Burglaries and rapes began occurring in the Sacramento area during the summer of 1976', 'All the crimes have been linked by DNA and/or details of the crimes', 'On February 2, 1978, Rancho Cordova couple Sergeant Brian Maggiore and his wife, Katie, were on an evening walk with their dog and were chased by the subject who overcame the couple and shot at close range', 'During these crimes, the subject would ransack the homes of his victims and take small items such as coins, jewelry, and identification']"

"– One of three suspects being hunted in the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris has turned himself in to authorities more than 100 miles away near the border with Belgium, authorities in France say. A police spokeswoman says Hamyd Mourad, 18, went to a police station, ""introduced himself, and was put in custody,"" reports the New York Times. According to some reports, the suspect turned himself in after seeing his name appear in social media and has told investigators he was in school at the time of the attack that killed 12 people, including four beloved French cartoonists at the satirical newspaper. Some who say they're his classmates have been maintaining the same thing, tweeting under the hashtag #MouradHamydInnocent. In other developments: A huge manhunt is underway for brothers Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, who are believed to have links to a Yemeni terrorist network. Seven people connected to the suspects were arrested overnight in the Paris area and in the towns of Reims and Charleville-Mezieres, the BBC reports. France's prime minister says the brothers were already known to intelligence services and ""our main concern"" is preventing them from carrying out another attack. There have been unconfirmed reports that the brothers have been spotted on a highway in northern France, with weapons visible in the back of their vehicle, the Guardian reports. Tens of thousands of Parisians joined vigils last night, and France has declared today a day of national mourning. A moment of silence was observed at noon. In what a CNN affiliate describes as ""their only mistake,"" an identification card belonging to one of the Kouachi brothers was found in a getaway car after the attack. There are conflicting accounts on how the slaughter during a Charlie Hebdo editorial meeting unfolded. CNN reports that a doctor who treated survivors was told the killing wasn't random, but was a ""precision execution"" with the two masked attackers separating men from women, then reading out names of victims they wanted to kill. Others, however, including police sources and a writer who managed to sound the alarm, described the attack as complete carnage, with the gunmen trying to kill as many people as possible, the Guardian reports.

"– Scientists are raising a red flag over the future of endangered right whales after a high number died in 2017. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that there are only about 450 North Atlantic right whales left after 17 were reported dead this year, according to Phys.org. And the news of such high mortality was exacerbated by a low number in births in 2017. Per the Guardian, there are only about 100 breeding female whales active in the species, making the fear of extinction all the more real. ""You do have to use the extinction word, because that's where the trend lines say they are,"" says John Bullard, NOAA’s Northeast Regional Administrator. ""That's something we can't let happen."" Along with the low number of breeding females, a study published in Endangered Species Research suggests that entrapment in fishing lines spikes stress levels in males, reducing their ability to reproduce. Co-author of the study Elizabeth Burgess says her colleagues are seeking solutions with the fishing community. (NOAA temporarily suspended its rescue operations this summer after a right whale struck and killed the rescuer untangling it from fishing lines.) Collisions with ships is another major cause of right whale death, and a study in Nature reports that the whales are seeking food outside protected areas. The problem will likely worsen, it states, “as water temperatures continue to rise, forcing movements towards both favorable oceanographic conditions and food sources elsewhere.”","['It is possible

"– Toyota's Scion brand has been ""euthanized,"" as Jalopnik puts it, with the car manufacturer announcing Wednesday the division will be killed, per a Toyota press release. The brand will be phased out, and existing models—including the MY17, FR-S sports car, iA sedan, iM hatchback, and C-HR concept car—will be folded into the Toyota lineup. The tC sports coupe will cease production entirely in August. ""This isn't a step backward for Scion; it's a leap forward for Toyota,"" says James Lentz, Toyota Motor North America's CEO and one of Scion's founders. Jalopnik notes the timing seems a ""bit strange,"" since two new Scion models are right now cruising into dealerships, but Lentz suggests the company simply did everything it wanted to do with the Scion, which started off as its own brand in 2003. ""Our goal was to make Toyota and our dealers stronger by learning how to better attract and engage young customers … [and] that's exactly what we have accomplished,"" he says. USA Today notes that goal was indeed achieved—in some respects. The average age of a Scion purchaser was 36—which the Wall Street Journal notes is almost 20 years younger than the average new car-buyer—and 70% of Scion buyers had never bought a Toyota before. But the brand was hampered by design problems and a limited number of models, among other issues, and sales started dropping after its 2006 peak: For comparison purposes, CNET points out that 56,000 Scions were sold in all of 2015—which equals about two months' worth of Camry sales. ""I just think the product was never really as compelling as it could have been or should have been,"" a Kelley Blue Book analyst says. No (publicly admitted) regrets from Toyota, though. ""Scion has allowed us to fast-track ideas that would have been challenging to test through the Toyota network,"" Lentz says. (A Forbes columnist thinks Toyota only has itself to blame.)","['Sure, there’s fans of the nicely-proportioned tC, and, of course, Scion got the great Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT86 as the FR-S, but beyond that, there hasn’t been much to really differentiate the brand', ""The 22 people who worked exclusively for Scion and the brand's regional sales representatives will be offered other jobs in Toyota, the company said"", 'The brand will cease in August and Toyota will fold most of the Scion branded vehicles into its Toyota lineup', 'Scion was established in 2003 as a way to target younger buyers and bring them into the Toyota family, which long suffered from one of the oldest demographics in the industry', 'Toyota will transition the Scion cars back to the Toyota brand instead', 'It seemed Scion never quite lived up to its full potential as a brand for the kids, and that’s kind of a shame', 'The truth is Scion’s relevance has been gone since at least 2006, with the redesign of the original xB, and with it, any car that really made the brand stand out from Toyota', 'The timing does seem a bit strange, considering two new cars meant to re-vitalize Scion’s lineup, the iM and the iA, are just now hitting dealerships, which would suggest Toyota isn’t really all that interested in giving those cars a chance to see what they can do for the marque', 'It’ll be interesting to see if Scion’s cars will be re-badged (again) as Toyotas; will the FR-S become the GT86 in the US, too?

"– Jill Stein managed to raise $3,509,477 for the 2016 election, reports Politico by way of an Oct. 19 FEC report—a figure now dwarfed by the amount of money her effort to secure recounts in three swing states has brought in. As of this writing, $4,746,660 has been pledged to the Green Party's quest to have votes recounted in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. At the Washington Post, David Weigel calls it ""the largest donation drive for a third party in history,"" but he's not too optimistic that it will amount to much, especially as plenty of cold water has been thrown on the argument that results ""may have been manipulated or hacked"" in those states.

"– A drive to create a new school district has snowballed into a push to split Louisiana's capital in two, with the largely wealthy and white southern part of Baton Rouge moving to secede and become the city of St. George, the Raw Story finds. The new city would have around a quarter of Baton Rouge's residents, but would rake in some 40% of its sales tax revenue with the help of two major retail centers. That would leave the northern part of the city, its population swollen by 200,000 former New Orleans residents displaced by Hurricane Katrina, struggling to fund its services, according to a study examining the potential secession. Leaders of the St. George secession effort say they now have around half the signatures needed to put it to a vote, reports the Advocate. They say the new city will be ""wide open"" and downplay warnings of fiscal disaster for the rest of the city, but opponents describe secession as unfair, noting that city funds were used to develop retail areas that would end up sucking in sales taxes from residents of the poorer part of the city.

The Wall Street Journal and New York Times report on a Sunday announcement from the two companies on a sparsely detailed deal to work together to develop products and tech for autonomous vehicles. It's a deal the Times says has ""competitive implications"" for ride-hailing company Uber, which is currently being sued by Waymo, the self-driving unit for Google parent Alphabet, over allegedly stolen trade secrets. A Gartner transportation analyst tells the Journal that the teaming up of Waymo and Lyft, which Reuters notes is the second US ride service by volume, could prove ""very powerful"" and that No. 1 Uber could see this as a ""significant threat.""

It seems that one group in particular, called Turla, puts comments on her Instagram posts that seem like spam but are actually a kind of hidden code that provide instructions for its malware, reports security company ESET. As Engadget explains, it is clever but complicated, but it doesn't mean that browsing Britney's Instagram will infect your computer. In the example cited by ESET, the since-deleted comment on this photo supposedly came from asmith2155 and read, ""#2 hot make loved to her, uupss #Hot #X."" That comment, however, was actually an encrypted message that, once deciphered, helps infected systems communicate with the Turla mothership. In this case, the actual malware was in a Firefox browser extension masquerading as a security feature. But once in place, that malware needs to communicate with its ""command and control"" server to get instructions on what to do and how to send stolen data. A post at Boing Boing takes it from there: ""Turla moves the C&C server around, then hides the current address of the server in encrypted comments left on Britney Spears's image posts,"" it explains. ""The compromised systems check in with Spears's Instagram whenever they need to know where the C&C server is currently residing."" In the constantly evolving cat-and-mouse game between hackers and security systems, it's a safe bet the strategy already has changed.

"– Want to buy a fixer-upper in Detroit? Probably not, but if you change your mind there's a three-bedroom available in east Detroit for an iPhone 6, ABC News reports. Real estate broker Larry Else admits there are problems, like no front door, broken windows, and $6,000 in back taxes that you'd have to take on. And the neighborhood is ""a little dicey,"" he says. ""This house is really not worth much at all."" (Else won't even enter the property due to a company policy about entering unsecured houses.) So why try and sell it? For one thing, the owner, who is staying anonymous and lives in Austria, wants it sold before ""thousands"" of other houses near foreclosure become available by tax auction. And the property has been a headache from the start. The owner snapped it up in 2010 for $41,000 because he was told it had rental value. Then he learned that the previous owner had bought it just two weeks before for $10,500, says Else: ""Public records don't show up that fast."" So far, Else is getting offers ""ranging in seriousness,"" reports ABC, and a neighbor tells MyFox Detroit that he's interested: ""I work on houses, so I would love to have it for [an iPhone 6],"" he says. ""It doesn't take a lot of money to fix these houses back up."" Meanwhile, Else says the price is negotiable; the owner would accept a 32GB iPad or ""anything, maybe an Android.""

"– After 12 years and hundreds of hours of legal battles, the state of Arkansas has successfully taken a man's life. Ledell Lee, a convicted murderer who'd been on death row for more than 20 years, was executed late Thursday after the US Supreme Court decided not to intervene, CNN reports. Prison officials say the 51-year-old inmate, who denied killing 26-year-old Debra Reese in 1993, requested Holy Communion as his last meal and declined to make a final statement. Neil Gorsuch voted with the majority in the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to allow the execution to proceed, reports the New York Times. Lee, whose death warrant expired at midnight, took 12 minutes to die and was pronounced dead at 11:56pm. Arkansas had planned to execute eight inmates before the end of April, but court decisions spared the first three men and put the execution of a fourth in doubt, the AP reports. The ACLU and the Innocence Project had called for post-conviction DNA testing in the case of Lee, who was also convicted of two rapes and suspected of a second murder. In the attack Lee was executed for, Reese was sexually assaulted before being hit 36 times with a tire-thumping tool that her husband, a truck driver, had given her to protect herself with when he was on the road. Her son, Joseph Lucky, was 6 years old when she was killed. At Lee's final clemency hearing, Lucky called him ""the embodiment of evil,"" THV11 reports.","['As for the State of Arkansas, they stayed the course, preparing to give Reese’s family the closure and

"– As Egypt continues to melt down, with the death toll from days of unrest nearing 1,000, the longtime strongman overthrown in the nation's bloody 2011 revolt is on the verge of becoming a free man. Hosni Mubarak will be released from jail this week, his lawyer tells Reuters, after Egypt's judiciary nullified a corruption charge against the frail 85-year-old. Pending the dismissal of another corruption charge, Mubarak is free to roam the streets. ""He should be freed by the end of the week,"" says the lawyer; a judicial source says that figure is more like two weeks. Though Mubarak faces a retrial for the killing of protesters in 2011, the AP reports he cannot continue to be held in custody because of a two-year limit pending a final verdict. Elsewhere on the ground: Some 25 police officers have been massacred as Islamic militants in the Sinai peninsula—where attacks on security forces have soared since Mohamed Morsi was removed from office last month—ambushed a pair of minibuses carrying the officers and killed them execution-style in broad daylight, the AP reports. The Egyptian government says 36 detainees captured in recent days died after clashes with police, Reuters reports. Officials say the detainees, part of a convoy headed to a prison, rioted and captured a police officer.

"– It may seem there's more fighting than rejoicing on Facebook lately, but for the residents of El Segundo, Calif., it's time to celebrate. ""They found the air horn guy!"" one local crowed online, per the Los Angeles Times, applauding a somewhat anticlimactic ending to the early-morning din that's been plaguing the city for six weeks. On its Facebook page, the El Segundo Police Department noted that at around 4am Sunday, officers heard an ""extremely loud air-horn being actuated"" and followed the sound to a 2006 Chevy Aveo driving around, which they pulled over. Inside: driver John Nuggent and air horn equipment, which Nuggent admitted to using to stir residents out of sleep. Several locals emerged from their homes and made a citizen's arrest against Nuggent—an important fact, the San Diego Union-Tribune notes, with police explaining that officers can't be victims of ""disturbing the peace."" Had the residents not come out, the cops would only have been able to give Nuggent a slap on the wrist for a traffic infraction; now the charge gets prosecutable misdemeanor status, with a maximum of 90 days in jail, a $400 fine, or both if he's found guilty. Sgt. Vincent Martinez tells the Times the blare fest was apparently Nuggent's way of retaliating against someone in the area with whom he had a beef. ""I've been an officer for over 27 years and I don't know if I've ever seen someone retaliate using an air horn,"" Martinez says. ""But people find very creative ways at getting at other people.""

(A Nebraska woman was charged with disturbing the peace—by sticking her hand in a tiger cage.)","['According to police, one of the residents who reported the horn told dispatchers on the phone Sunday that they’d actually seen the driver before, and that resident was able to positively identify Nuggent as the suspect', 'When an officer tried the car’s horn, the sound of “a big truck or train” blasted from the diminutive hatchback, he said', 'Nuggent, admitted he was the man who for the last six weeks had been driving down the street in the middle of the night waking up residents, Martinez said', 'In the back of the car, officers found an air tank with hoses connected to a device near the car’s gas pedal, Martinez said', 'The target of Nuggent’s nuisance was a resident on the street with whom he had some sort of dispute, Martinez said', 'Police said there were several reports, spanning several weeks, of the same horn in the neighborhood coming from the same 4-door compact vehicle driven', 'On Sunday, patrol officers heard the blare of an actuated air horn — a device similar to a train horn — as it shattered the pre-dawn silence of El Segundo’s west side at about 4 a', 'EL SEGUNDO, CA (WCMH) — Police say the man was blowing the extremely loud horn early in the morning, disturbing several neighbors', 'Multiple neighbors responded to the scene and initiated a citizen’s arrest of Nuggent', 'According to El Segundo police, at about 4am, November 13, officers in the west side of a town heard an extremely loud horn being actuated that sounded similar to a train horn', 'Nuggent was taken into custody and is being charged with suspicion of disturbing the peace', 'Nuggent was arrested on suspicion of disturbing the peace', 'Officers looked around and saw only one car on the street — a little blue four-door, 2006 Chevrolet Aveo — and pulled it over, said Sgt']"

One of bobsledding's biggest names, Steven Holcomb, tells USA Today that the video was insulting to him and other bobsledders who make far less money than athletes in other sports.

"– The president and Stormy Daniels traded insults on Twitter Tuesday and revealed new nicknames for each other in the process. It's ""Horseface"" vs. ""Tiny."" The fireworks started after a judge dismissed a defamation suit brought by Daniels against Trump. ""Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas,"" wrote Trump, referring also to Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, reports NBC News. ""She will confirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me, a total con!"" Daniels quickly shot back: ""Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present your president. In addition to his...umm...shortcomings, he has demonstrated his incompetence, hatred of women and lack of self control on Twitter AGAIN! And perhaps a penchant for bestiality. Game on, Tiny."" The latest slams come after Daniels wrote about the president's private parts in her book, then said she regretted body shaming him. The dismissal of the defamation suit (Trump accused Daniels of making up a story about being physically threatened to stay quiet about their alleged affair) is not the end of their legal fight.

"– Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro may have wrecked his chances of becoming Hillary Clinton's running mate—with a Hillary Clinton endorsement. An Office of Special Counsel investigation has determined that Castro broke the 1939 Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of federal executive branch employees, during an April interview with Katie Couric for Yahoo News, USA Today reports. Clinton is the ""most experienced, thoughtful, and prepared candidate for president that we have this year,"" Castro said during the interview, which was arranged through his office, involved discussion of HUD policies, and took place in front of the HUD seal. He told Couric that Clinton had a ""positive vision"" for the country and went on to describe Donald Trump as not prepared to be president. Before praising Clinton, Castro told Couric he was ""taking off my HUD hat for a second and just speaking individually,"" but he still ""impermissibly mixed his personal political views with official government agency business,"" according to the OSC report, which explains that federal employees are ""permitted to make partisan remarks when speaking in their personal capacity, but not when using their official title or when speaking about agency business."" Castro has admitted he goofed, and while he could be fined up to $1,000, he's highly unlikely to receive anything more than a reprimand for the Hatch Act violation. Still, this may be a ""reminder that Castro is still a relative political newcomer and lacks the savvy and expertise of some others on Clinton's short list,"" the Los Angeles Times notes.","['But investigators found that the format in this case left the impression that Castro was speaking on behalf of HUD, and not as a private citizen, when he made his pitch for Hillary Clinton during the interview', '""The secretary takes the Hatch Act very seriously and he has committed to taking steps to ensure understanding and compliance with the Hatch Act throughout the Department of Housing and Urban Development', 'Speaking of the veepstakes, the Clinton campaign just announced that the candidate will be holding events in the crucial swing state of Florida on Friday and Saturday', 'However, your analysis provides that it was not sufficient,"" Castro said in a response to the Office of Special Counsel', 'Castro, who Clinton has mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate, told reporter Katie Couric in the interview that ""Clinton is the most experienced, thoughtful, and prepared candidate for president that we have this year', 'Still, the incident is another reminder that Castro is still a relative political newcomer and lacks the savvy and expertise of some others on Clinton’s short list', 'Because Castro is a cabinet secretary, the investigative report goes directly to the president for possible disciplinary action', 'That violated the Hatch Act, according to an investigative report submitted to President Obama Monday by the Office of Special Counsel', 'An investigation by the Office of Special Counsel found Castro recently violated the Hatch Act by mixing politics with his government job', 'The interview was coordinated through Castro’s government office and took place with the HUD seal behind him', 'During the interview, Castro answered a few questions about his agency’s work until conversation turned, predictably, to the upcoming presidential election', ""Violations of the Hatch Act can lead to a civil fine of as much as $1,000, but two legal experts with experience with the statute said they could not recall a case with facts similar to Castro's that was resolved with anything more dramatic than a reprimand""]"
"– A few lucky neighborhoods in Kansas City already have access to Google Fiber, and the cable industry better take notice, writes Henry Blodget at Business Insider.

The Republican legislator, who is on a self-pronounced ""quest to seek and destroy unnecessary burdens on the freedom and liberties of people"" is looking to legalize ""dwarf tossing"" in the state—all in the name of job creation, of course. Florida banned the practice in 1989, reports the Palm Beach Post, but Workman calls it ""an example of Big Brother government"" that does little more than ""prevent some dwarfs from getting jobs they would be happy to get."" So he filed a bill on Monday that would bring back the activity, which he eloquently describes as ""repulsive and stupid."" But, hideous as it is, ""it's none of the state's business if somebody wants to do this,"" says Workman. How is his effort being received by the Little People of America? Its Florida district director notes that ""the possibility of getting paralyzed is high,"" and adds that ""to be used as an object for people's amusement is very degrading.""

Rick Scott included two rules related to dwarf tossing among the 1,000 he said he'd like to repeal.","['The division may suspend or revoke the license of and may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 against any person in violation of any rule promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this section, as authorized and according to the procedures set forth in s', 'Sure enough, he wants to repeal two of the rules from the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco related to dwarf tossing', 'Workman told the Current that the only thing the ban on dwarf tossing did was take away employment opportunities for people with dwarfism', 'Later that year, the state legislature moved to end dwarf tossing by passing a law that punished bars with $1,000 fines and a revocation of their liquor licenses if they staged these events', '""I\'m on a quest to seek and destroy unnecessary burdens on the freedom and liberties of people,"" Workman said', 'Van Etten, a 3-foot-5-inch engineering consultant and former president of Little People of America, has worked with his wife, Angela, for years to educate people about the physical and psychological dangers of dwarf tossing', 'The judge ruled that the lawsuit was ""without controversy"" because Florida had passed the law, but took no actions to enforce it', 'The Palm Beach County Commission voted that same year to pass a local dwarf-tossing ordinance if the state legislature failed to act', 'David Dodge, 43, of Vero Beach is a computer network consultant and the 4-foot-4-inch Florida district director of the Little People of America', '""The possibility of getting paralyzed is high,"" Dodge said, ""and then to be used as an object for people\'s amusement is very degrading', 'The little person credited with bringing dwarf tossing to Florida died of acute alcohol poisoning in 1989', 'In 2001, a 3-foot-2 radio host known as ""Dave the Dwarf"" filed a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn Florida\'s ban on the ""activity,"" saying he wanted the same opportunity for employment as everyone else', 'Ritch Workman, R-Melbourne, filed a bill this week to bring back ""dwarf tossing,"" the barbaric and dangerous barroom spectacle that was imported from Australia and thrived briefly in Florida before it was outlawed in 1989', ""But it's none of the state's business if somebody wants to do this"", 'His bill has yet to be assigned to committee, but you can read the brief text of it here', 'Bringing dwarf tossing back to Florida is a step backward, he said, a move that signals a permissive air of mockery on an entire class of people', 'For the purposes of this section, the term ""dwarfism"" means a disproportionate or proportionate short stature most often caused by a genetic syndrome', 'Ten years ago, Dave Flood, who was employed as ""Dave the Dwarf"" by a Tampa morning radio station, filed a federal lawsuit to challenge the state law that banned dwarf tossing']"
"– Women have surged to the forefront of the presidential race in the wake of Tuesday's debate, with both candidates furiously courting the demographic. Both candidates talked about women on the campaign trail—as did their surrogates—and the Romney campaign released a new ad shedding a more moderate light on his abortion stance. Elsewhere on the trail: ""What I can't understand is how (Romney) has gotten in this sort of 1950s time warp in terms of women,"" Joe Biden told a crowd in Colorado, referring to Romney's debate performance, in which he said women workers often had to rush home to make dinner for their kids, CNN reports, though it notes that Romney's comments scored well with women on the network's dial test. Romney and his surrogates, meanwhile, tried to court women by focusing on the economy. ""The No. 1 issue with women is jobs,"" said Rep. Marsha Blackburn. But the LA Times points out that polls in 12 swing states show abortion is the No. 1 issue with women, ranking it twice as important as jobs. Romney strategists tell the New York Times that their focus groups showed the same thing, which is why they've released a new ad in which a woman discovers that Romney ""doesn't oppose contraception at all"" and supports abortion in cases of rape, incest, and when the health of the mother is at stake. ""This issue is important to me, but I'm more concerned about the debt our children could be left with,"" she says. Meanwhile, the fallout from Romney's ""binders"" comment continues. The Boston Globe reported that during Romney's Bain tenure, the firm didn't have a single female partner—though the Washington Post notes that Meg Whitman did get her start there as a consultant.","['That accounted for some of the gains Romney had made in opinion polling, which encouraged Republicans and prompted Obama and his Democratic allies to redouble their courtship of

"– Front-runner Newt Gingrich took a few licks but stood his ground tonight at the GOP presidential debate in Iowa, Politico reports. After Romney described himself as a businessman—not a politician like Gingrich—Newt fired back: ""Let's be candid.

After the audience ""ooohed,"" Romney returned fire: ""Losing to Teddy Kennedy was probably the best thing I could have done for preparing me for the job I’m seeking,"" the New York Times reports. In other highlights: Gingrich repeated his position that Washington should let illegals stay in the US under certain strict conditions. ""That's not amnesty,"" he said. Romney countered that Gingrich's plan ""will then create another magnet that draws people into our country illegally""—but didn't say he would try to deport illegal immigrants. Gingrich defended his remark that Palestinians are an ""invented people,"" and said it's time people admit that Israel is a nation under fire from ""terrorists."" Countered Romney: ""You don't speak for Israel. If Bibi Netanyahu wants to say what you said, let him say it."" Bachmann called Gingrich part of the problem and referred to him and Romney as ""Newt Romney""—meaning their policies are basically the same. ""If you want a difference, Michele Bachmann is the proven conservative,"" Bachmann said. ""It's not Newt Romney."" Rick Perry attacked Gingrich's character by saying that ""if you cheat on your wife, you'll cheat on your business partner."" Gingrich has been married three times, and admitted to cheating on his second wife. Replied Newt: ""It is a real issue.

"– President Trump stood out Saturday as the only G20 leader not offering his support for the Paris climate agreement, but that wasn't the only buzzworthy happening in Hamburg with the name ""Trump"" attached to it. Per Bloomberg, when the president slipped away from a meeting on migration that included such world leaders as UK Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, another Trump slipped quietly into his seat. A spokesman for Ivanka Trump concedes the first daughter, who'd been sitting in the back of the room, did briefly take the place of the president (who'd gone off to some one-on-one meetings with other leaders) at the table of global bigwigs, though an official who saw the seat swapping take place says Ivanka didn't say anything during her time at the table. A photo of Ivanka sitting between Xi and May, with Merkel a few seats down, was first posted on Twitter (and then removed) by Svetlana Lukash, who calls herself a ""Russian G20 Sherpa,"" per CNN. Critics are upset that the unelected Ivanka stepped in for her father in a move the Washington Post calls ""somewhat unusual,"" as heads of state in such situations are usually replaced by senior government officials. The Hill notes reaction online, with some calling the move by the ""inexperienced"" Ivanka ""banana-republicky,"" others snarking the summit wasn't ""Take Your Daughter to Work day,"" and some noting Ivanka had said just last month: ""I try to stay out of politics.""

"– A state dinner with a difference: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi begins a visit to the US today, but although he'll be having a private dinner with President Obama, the White House chefs might as well take the night off because Modi is visiting in the middle of a nine-day fast. A spokesman says the leader has been observing the religious fast annually for 40 years and won't be consuming anything more than water, the Wall Street Journal reports. Obama—and Joe Biden, who will be having lunch with Modi—should probably grab a bite to eat before ""dining"" with the leader: ""It's very bad form to sit in front of fasting guests and eat heartily,"" a former White House executive chef tells the WSJ. ""It's just not polite."" Despite the lack of fuel, Modi has a hectic schedule involving more than 50 engagements during his five days in the US, including a sold-out appearance at New York City's Madison Square Garden, reports the New York Times. His landslide election victory in May put India's long-dominant Congress party out of power, and the US visit is seen as a chance to reboot a relationship that soured after a female Indian diplomat was arrested and strip-searched last year.

"– The Mega Millions jackpot has inspired much media babble about lottery winners, losers, and what to do if you actually win. But how about the effect of lotteries on the poor? Apparently, it's a killer ""hidden tax""—because households banking less than $13,000 a year spend 9% of their annual income on lottery tickets. Business Insider found the shocking statistic in a PBS interview, and says it raises serious questions—like, are the poor too dumb to avoid odds 17 times worse than the chance of being hit by falling airplane parts? The likely answer: No, they're just grabbing at any chance to improve their circumstances. Looking behind the numbers, Business Insider poses more questions: With the poor receiving tax breaks, welfare, etc, is that money going straight into lottery tickets? Wouldn't it be better just to tax them? Or, in this tax-averse nation, is it better to raise all tax revenue through lotteries?

"– As the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry puts it in a press release, ""The 7th period of the periodic table of elements is complete."" It has verified the discovery of elements 113, 115, 117, and 118, effectively filling the 7th row and ""rendering science textbooks around the world instantly out of date,"" reports the Guardian. The elements currently have temporary working names and symbols. IUPAC's Dec. 30 announcement will ultimately lead to permanent ones, which the discoverers can now propose; the release specifies that ""new elements can be named after a mythological concept, a mineral, a place or country, a property or a scientist."" One candidate for the highly radioactive element 113: japonium, per the Japanese government-affiliated Riken Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, which was given credit for the element. The Guardian notes the element will be the first to have a name bestowed on it from Asia. The AP reports that the Japanese scientists behind the synthetic element started working to create it in 2003 ""by bombarding a thin layer of bismuth with zinc ions traveling at about 10% the speed of light."" They were in competition with a team of Russian and American scientists who were also gunning for the naming rights after announcing that same element's discovery in 2004. But the honor went to Japan, and the team leader says he intends to spend part of 2016 coming up with it. A bit of science-wow from the AP: ""Isotopes of element 113 have a very short half-life, lasting for less than a thousandth of a second, making its discovery very difficult.

"– It was a sight to create sore eyes: Naked and extremely unflattering statues of a Donald Trump without testicles were erected simultaneously in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Seattle early Thursday. Anarchist collective INDECLINE was behind the project, and a spokesman tells the Washington Post that the ""Emperor Has No Balls"" project was designed to humiliate the candidate and was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale. ""Trump is a larger-than-life figure in world culture at the moment"" and the statues are also a reference to the tendency of authoritarian leaders to erect statues of themselves, the spokesman says. The group tapped artist Joshua Monroe to design the statue because of his background in designing monsters for movies and haunted houses. He tells the Daily Beast that he ""utterly detests"" the Clintons and wouldn't hesitate to create a similar statue of Hillary Clinton. The statue in New York City's Union Square was quickly taken down, as was the one in Cleveland. ""NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small,"" a Parks Department spokesperson tells Gothamist. ""People have asked if I was upset that the statues are being destroyed,"" Monroe tells the San Francisco Chronicle. ""Not at all. I wouldn't mind taking a baseball bat to one.""","['Hoping to strip away the Teflon Don’s legendary confidence to reveal the fleshy mortal beneath the expensive suits and long ties, members of the anarchist collective INDECLINE decided they would showcase the aspirant president in the most humiliating way they could imagine: without his clothes', 'In a press release for the project, INDECLINE outlined its hopes for the impact of their collaboration with Monroe: “These fleeting installations represent this fleeting nightmare and in the fall, it is our wish to look back and laugh at Donald Trump’s failed and delusional quest to obtain the presidency', '“Like it or not, Trump is a larger-than-life figure in world culture at the moment,” said the spokesman, who discussed the project with The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity', 'After working for close to five years to get the project going and pulling all-nighters in the weeks leading up to the grand opening, Monroe said that he “parted ways with the owner and management” after finding out they had merely “bought Roth’s name', 'For the Trump statues, Monroe was brought aboard after being “tapped” by INDECLINE and was the only collaborator on the project not previously part of the studio', 'The collaboration, entitled “The Emperor Has No Balls,” was the brainchild of INDECLINE, who, according to artist Joshua Monroe, who used the alias “Ginger” to avoid “backlash,” had “very specific criteria” set as to “what the statue would include and what it would not', 'When Ginger began the process, he said, he was actually considering punching his ballot for Trump in the general election because the candidate’s message resonated with the middle class', 'The studio behind the project, the self-described “American Activist Collective” INDECLINE, was credited on the base of each sculpture and the artist’s signature, “Ginger,” was engraved in each clay figure', 'The Washington Post broke the story that INDECLINE was behind the project and released some of the first statements by the studio', 'Included in the statues are subliminal jokes carved into the texture of the statue’s skin, he noted', 'On the right hand, the statue version of Trump is wearing a Masonic ring, a piece of jewelry emblematic of privilege, secret handshakes and cloistered groups of powerful people, the artist said', 'In fact, while Monroe was always enthusiastic to be part of “The Emperor has no Balls” project, he was upfront with the studio at the outset, admitting he was planning on voting for Trump', 'Eventually, as he worked through the project, however, and heard more of the “amazingly stupid things Trump has said,” he became less excited about the prospect of a Trump presidency', 'Inspired in part by the Hans Christian Anderson story about an overly self-assured leader who fails to realize his new suit is in fact his birthday suit, according to a studio spokesperson, the intent was to create a mocking tribute to the “modern day Emperor of Fascism and Bigotry', '“The straw that broke the camel’s back was when he made fun of the disabled reporter from the New York Times', 'The goal was to give him the slightest hint of a scowl — a “constipated look” — that hinted at Trump’s implicit frustration with contemporary America, Ginger said', 'The eyes scowl, the mouth pouts and the veiny, almost reptilian skin looks like it was torn off a human-size frog and dipped in bronzer', 'After finishing the sculptures in an undisclosed studio on the West Coast, Monroe and INDECLINE team members shipped them to the five locations where they would be unveiled', 'In the past, the collective has also claimed responsibility for an anti-Trump “Rape” mural on the U', 'Ginger’s mother gave birth to him via C-section and — before doctors had time to remove him from the womb — his hand popped out of the slit in his mother’s abdomen, covered in maternal slime, he said, prompting a nurse to faint', 'The job of conceptualizing and creating the statues fell to a man who goes by the name “Ginger,” a Las Vegas-based artist', 'The spokesperson said he did not know where the piece was taken and only saw it being “slid into the back of a pickup truck', 'The statue is meant to be a takeoff on the familiar fairy-tale line, “The emperor has no clothes', 'Monroe was chosen to create the likeness of the “monstrous” presidential candidate because of his experience designing monsters for horror movies and haunted houses, including serving as the director for Eli Roth’s now defunct “Goretorium” in Las Vegas', '“The Emperor Has No B—s,” as the project is called, arrives several months after the group covered stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with the names of African Americans who have been killed by police', 'Right now, the suspicion is that San Francisco’s Trump will remain intact the longest, with local lefties coming to its rescue, the group’s spokesman said', 'On Thursday night, Supervisor Scott Wiener, who represents the Castro on the Board of Supervisors, tweeted that the statue was to be removed overnight, but that he was “working to save him so SF can be reminded of his ridiculousness thru election', 'Suggesting Trump is more of a (potential) ruler than a revolutionary, the statues also poke fun at the authoritarian tendency to erect large monuments in one’s likeness', 'He said he did the piece “pro bono” and while he’s “worked out the percentages” should the piece sell, he would be “very happy” to work with the studio again', 'And that’s not the only reason the sculptor considered himself the ideal candidate', 'Note the title of the piece: The Emperor Has No Balls', 'It is through these sculptures that we leave behind the physical and metaphorical embodiment of the ghastly soul of one of America’s most infamous and reviled politicians', 'The spokesperson told The Daily Beast that the New York City piece, which was erected in Union Square, was taken down “about half an hour after The Washington Post [article] went up because the article was “making them look bad and feel like they should go do their job', 'The first was sculpting the original, 700-pound model in specialty clay using a 6-foot-2 “hired model with similar proportions” to Trump', 'A spokesman for the group said it took months of planning to install the statues', '“The last straw,” Monroe told The Daily Beast, “was when Trump made fun of the disabled reporter', 'An excerpt of video released by the group shows the making of the statues', 'In addition to doing makeup for a Busta Rhymes video, Ginger’s résumé includes another source of great pride for the artist: He’s a regular keynote speaker at haunted house conventions across the country', 'Placed at the corner of Jane Warner Plaza, the figure is both realistic and grotesque', 'The group’s latest project has been four months in the making and was inspired, in part, by “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” Hans

regarding the sight, “it isn’t Pride Week, and there’s no sock', 'The INDECLINE spokesperson said the studio had “never worked in this medium before” and found it quite “time consuming', 'sculpture was still erect, as were the San Francisco and Seattle artworks—a “big surprise” to the studio and artist', 'The five locations were chosen based on where the “activist collective” has existing collaborators, the INDECLINE spokesperson told The Daily Beast', 'Ginger used 300 pounds of clay and silicone to create the statues and said the candidate’s mouth ended up being his biggest sculpting challenge', 'The group unveiled life-size statues of Trump in the nude Thursday morning in public spaces in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland and Seattle', 'The process of creating the sculpture consisted of two stages, according to Monroe', '[The piece] was readily accepted because he is a man and one who is quick to body-shame,” Monroe told The Daily Beast', 'The artist, who has a full-time job, said he spent up to 25 hours each week working on the statues since they were commissioned in April', 'According to the INDECLINE spokesperson, the statues all went up without a hitch using “insult teams with hard hats and neon construction vests', '” The studio had “no permit” for the pieces, which they remarked were on public property and believed that city police would feel they would “have to step in and take them down', 'The artist who created the statues said they weigh 80 pounds each and required four months to create', 'The undertaking began in April and required over 1,500 hours of work over the course of four months', '“Starting on the project and looking at his face day in and day out when I’d come home, I began to build up some resentment,” Ginger told The

little mouth, the way his chin meets the jowl, it had to look right,” he said', 'Unlike monuments of most political figures in cities across the globe, the Trump statues are far from flattering', 'It would be safe to say that the reaction has been beyond the group’s expectations', ""And that's the end of naked Trump in Union Square (pic: @kozu_kozu_u) #NYC #NBC4NY pic"", ': Parks Department

"– President Trump regaled political donors this week with a strange story about a ""bowling ball test"" that he says Japan uses to unfairly block imports of American cars. ""That’s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car,"" he told donors in Missouri. ""And if the hood dents, then the car doesn’t qualify. ... It's horrible the way we're treated."" In its original coverage of the statement, the Washington Post added, ""It was unclear what he was talking about."" Others were similarly perplexed. ""I have no idea what he was talking about,"" a director at the research firm Center for Automotive Research tells NBC News. ""I've never heard of such a test,"" a Honda spokesperson tells the Japan Times. ""If we did that, I think our cars would also dent."" So what was Trump talking about? ""Obviously, he's joking about this particular test,” White House press chief Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday, adding that the remark was ""illustrative of creative practices” used to block American products. Not everybody was buying that explanation, and Post reporter Josh Dawsey tweets that the president has previously brought up the supposed test in meetings. Colleague Philip Bump at the Post digs in, suggesting that perhaps Trump has morphed this Nissan ad into reality. A possibly more plausible explanation he offers is that the tale stems from an actual test Japan conducts in which a ""head-shaped object"" is fired at the hood of a car, the idea being to measure potential damage to a pedestrian. (Trump's comments about bluffing Canada's Justin Trudeau made the bigger headlines from the speech.)","['Dziczek said the Trans-Pacific Partnership eased the regulatory hurdles American automakers face selling cars in Japan, by allowing signatories to use the same expedited review processes domestic Japanese carmakers enjoyed with their vehicles', 'The test, which is conducted in Japan, Europe, Russia and other countries according to a global standard, evaluates whether a car properly dents when it hits an object so as to reduce the damage to pedestrians, not whether it’s strong enough to stay intact after an accident, the official said', 'The center estimated in one study that regulatory differences between the European Union and the United States cost the auto industry $3', '“It’s called the bowling ball test, do you know what that is?

"– Brock Turner may have received just a six-month sentence (of which he'll likely serve only three) from a judge for raping an unconscious girl behind a dumpster, but he won't get the same leniency from USA Swimming, USA Today reports. The organization, which oversees all professional swim competitions in the US, announced this week that the 20-year-old Stanford swimmer had been permanently banned. “USA Swimming condemns the crime and actions committed by Brock Turner, and all acts of sexual misconduct,” ABC News quotes USA Swimming as saying in a statement. Turner was expected to be a future Olympian, but the lifetime ban effectively ends that dream, according to Jezebel. The USA Swimming-sanctioned events from which Turner is banned include Olympic trials. Turner's membership with USA Swimming lapsed at the end of 2014, just before he raped the victim after a frat party in January 2015. ""Brock Turner is not a member of USA Swimming and, should he apply, he would not be eligible for membership,” says the USA Swimming statement. Had he been a member, he would have been kicked out for sexual misconduct in violation of the organization's rules of conduct. In addition to his six-month sentence—for which the judge is receiving blowback from potential jurors in other cases—Turner will have to register as a sex offender, CNN reports. Turner plans to appeal the sentence, but it's unlikely he'll ever represent the US as a professional swimmer.","['I began to champion the idea of relieving the stress of school and swimming by consuming alcohol on weekends with people,” Turner said in the statement', 'The USA Swimming reaction is the latest example of a wave of national condemnation of the sentence', 'She told of going to a fraternity party near Stanford in January 2015, drinking and then not knowing what happened to her between the time of the party and being conscious in a hospital with pine needles in her hair', '""Brock Turner\'s membership with USA Swimming expired at the end of the calendar year 2014 and he was not a member at the time of his crime or since then,"" USA Swimming spokesman Scott Leightman said', '“A series of alcohol-fueled decisions that he made within an hour time span will define him for the rest of his life,” Caroline wrote in a letter to the judge', 'Brock Turner, the former Stanford student and ex-swimmer who was sentenced to a meager six months for sexual assault last week, has been banned from USA Swimming, the governing body for professional swimming in the United States, for life', 'Turner, who was convicted of raping an unconscious woman behind the dumpster of a frat house in 2015, will not be able to compete in any events sanctioned by the swimming organization according to an official statement on Monday, June 9', 'Although Turner’s membership with the organization expired at the end of 2014, before he committed the crime, the move blocks the 20-year-old from being eligible for one ever again', 'As Bustle succinctly stated, “the group [is] a bastion of misogyny, full of juvenile sexism and insecure displays of masculinity,” with a number of rape apologist memes to boot', '"" Brock Turner, the former Stanford University swimmer who was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on campus, has been banned for life by USA Swimming, the national governing body of competitive swimming', ""The unidentified victim, now 23, responded to Turner’s statement to the judge in an emotional letter she read in court, slamming the former swimmer's statement"", 'ABC News obtained a copy of Turner’s full statement to the judge, in which the ex-student blames “partying” and “drinking” for his actions', '""Had he been a member, he would have been subject to the USA Swimming Code of Conduct,"" the statement said', 'Turner said he was ""sorry for what he put the victim and her family through during the trial,"" according to the officer\'s report, which CNN obtained', 'Brock Turner’s membership with USA Swimming expired at the end of the calendar year 2014', 'Had he been a member, he would be subject to the USA Swimming Code of Conduct', '""USA Swimming strictly prohibits and has zero tolerance for sexual misconduct, with firm Code of Conduct policies in place, and severe penalties, including a permanent ban of membership, for those who violate the Code of Conduct', 'USA Swimming strictly prohibits and has zero tolerance for sexual misconduct, with firm Code of Conduct policies in place, and severe penalties, including a permanent ban of membership, for those who violate the Code of Conduct', 'The school did ""everything within its power to assure that justice was served,"" from immediately investigating the case to referring it to the Santa Clara County district attorney\'s office for prosecution, the statement said', 'News of the ban became public the same day a Facebook group campaign—titled “Brock Turner for Olympics 2016""—also went viral', 'Swimmers must be a member of USA Swimming to compete in sanctioned events, including the upcoming U', 'The ban against Turner, who was slated to be a future Olympian for the U', '""He also failed to send the message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class, race, gender or other factors', '""Judge Persky failed to see that the fact that Brock Turner is a white male star athlete at a prestigious university does not entitle him to leniency,"" the petition read', '“USA Swimming condemns the crime and actions committed by Brock Turner, and all acts of sexual misconduct', 'Turner also told the officer, ""That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case', 'She described the traumatic and humiliating experience of enduring an hours-long forensic exam for sexual assault', 'Turner’s older sister, Caroline, also wrote a letter to the judge about her brother, who was awarded a 60 percent swimming scholarship by the university', ""The outcry over a sentence seen as lenient by many was compounded by widely circulated letters to the judge from the victim and Turner's father""]"
"– A word of warning if you're planning an elaborate wedding dance in the hope that it'll make a splash online. As an engaged couple in the UK recently learned, it might go viral for reasons other than the ones you anticipated—and even result in a trip to the emergency room. In what was thankfully a trial run of the dance they planned on performing at their wedding next year, Sharon and Andy Price attempted the famous lift from Dirty Dancing and ended up crumpled on the ground in Weston-super-Mare, England, report the SWNS and Bristol Post. The couple—who've seen Dirty Dancing more than 30 times—say they were at a beer garden when they decided the lift would be a great addition to their wedding dance. ""We immediately set about trying to re-create that iconic moment,"" says Sharon, 52. ""But it's fair to say it didn't go to plan."" As a relative snapped photos, Sharon ran at Andy, 51. But instead of being lifted into the air, she collided with her groom-to-be and fell to the ground, winded. Andy, meanwhile, was knocked unconscious. ""At first our family thought we were just messing about, but they soon realized we had actually really hurt ourselves"" and called an ambulance, Sharon says. ""We are OK now, but Andy has a bruised back and neck and my back still hurts."" She adds the couple will be opting for a ""more sedate"" first dance at their wedding next October. ""I think we're going to go for a slow one,"" she says.","['Sharon Price and groom-to-be Andy Price were out with family enjoying a drink in the Cabot pub on Weston-super-Mare seafront when they struck on the idea of performing the dance at their upcoming nuptials next October', 'The couple had been enjoying the sunshine in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, when they were inspired to recreate the scene from the 1987 movie', '“We were in the beer garden and my niece and nephew were messing around trying to do the lift', 'They have both watched the 80s moves over 30 times and wanted to do the famous lift moment on the Big Day', 'They were taken to Southmead Hospital where they spent several hours being checked over before being released in the early hours of the morning', 'The pair collided, causing Andy, 51, to fall back and knock himself unconscious', 'So, with the sun shining, they started to practice in the beer garden with Sharon running at Andy ready for him to lift her above his head as Patrick Swayze does with Jennifer Grey in the movie', '"" This was the moment a couple tried to practice a performance of the iconic lift from ‘Dirty Dancing’ ahead of their wedding – and both ended up in A&E', 'Bride-to-be Sharon Price and fiance Andy Price were left unconscious after their attempt to recreate the famous film spectacularly flopped', 'But instead the couple ended up flat out on the grass', 'But things went disastrously wrong when they collided and Andy, 51, was knocked out cold and they were both pictured sprawled out on the floor', 'The pair’s bodged attempt at recreating the water lift has seen them become the butt of many peoples’ jokes', 'Sharon, 52, was also bruised and both were rushed to a nearby hospital after the relatives they were with realised they weren’t joking', '“But we can definitely see the funny side and are laughing along with them', 'The pair are now back at their home in Knowle, battered, bruised and slightly red faced', 'Paramedics loaded Andy into an ambulance after cutting off his t-shirt, and switched on the blue lights as they rushed him to Southmead Hospital in Bristol', 'Andy’s niece Kerri, 21, who took the photos, said: “We didn’t know how serious it was until we saw them on the floor', 'But the dance move – deemed to be one of the most romantic of all time – didn’t go quite as planned', 'Andy got down on one knee after Christmas Day lunch last year and popped the question', '“The paramedics were pretty worried about Andy and cut his t shirt off and blue-lighted him up to Southmead Hospital', 'The couple, who are both grandparents, are going to tie the knot next year', 'She said: “The paramedics were pretty worried about Andy and cut his t shirt off and blue-lighted him up to Southmead Hospital', 'Their family – once they had finished laughing after thinking the pair were playing a joke – soon realised the couple had actually hurt themselves and called an ambulance', 'A couple’s dream to recreate the iconic Dirty Dancing lift on their wedding day saw them end up in accident and emergency - after a practice run went badly wrong']"
"– The opposition party led by Aung San Suu Kyi sounds very confident after elections that the Independent describes as the freest in Burma's history. Her National League for Democracy party is expected to make huge gains after Sunday's vote in the country's first free national election in 25 years, and numerous candidates from the ruling, military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party have already admitted defeat, the BBC reports. ""I think you all have the idea of the results,"" Suu Kyi told cheering supporters on Monday morning, though it's not clear whether the party will have the two-thirds majority in the country's parliament needed to form a government, reports Reuters. The election comes after decades of struggle by Suu Kyi, including 15 years under house arrest, but though she has said she wants to become president, the constitution bars her from the position because her two sons hold British nationality, the BBC notes. US Secretary of State John Kerry praised the election as a ""testament to the courage and sacrifice shown by the people of Burma over many decades"" while also describing the vote as ""far from perfect"" due to the disfranchisement of groups like the Muslim Rohingya minority and the reservation of seats in parliament for the military, reports the Guardian.","['It promises to deal with the root causes of the ethnic conflicts that have wracked the nation ever since independence, on the principles of equal rights and self-determination', 'For the United States and the international community to provide the kind of support Myanmar needed, Russel said, the transition from the current government to the future administration “is going to have to be credible', ""In one of the earliest and most significant known results, the ruling party's Shwe Mann, who is Speaker of the lower house of parliament, conceded defeat in his constituency to the NLD candidate"", 'In 1990, the National League for Democracy triumphed over the proxies of the Burmese military dictatorship in a free and fair election, but the generals brushed the result aside', 'The NLD said its own tally of results posted at polling stations around the country showed it was on track to win more than 70 percent of the seats being contested in parliament, above the two-thirds threshold it needs to form Myanmar’s first democratically elected government since the early 1960s', 'The extent of her appeal was demonstrated by the results declared so far: not only in the heartland, where her popularity was well understood, but throughout all the ethnic areas as well: the Mon, the Karen, the Kachin, the Chin; all overwhelmingly preferred her and her candidates to those of the ethnic parties set up to represent them', 'A quarter of the parliamentary seats are reserved for the army, and for the NLD to have the winning majority it will need at least two-thirds of the contested seats', 'The junta-drafted constitution guarantees one-quarter of parliament’s seats to unelected members of the military and allows the commander-in-chief to nominate the head of three powerful ministries: interior, defense and border security', 'Our correspondent says that if the NLD win, it will face difficulties in changing the constitution on its own as the document still gives the military considerable power, and the party would most likely nominate someone else to be president', 'By late afternoon on Monday, vendors outside the headquarters of the National League for Democracy (NLD) in the commercial capital Yangon were selling red T-shirts with Suu Kyi’s face and the words “We won”', 'That was the chord she struck during her earliest appearances in 1988, and the years of stubborn resistance in her home strengthened and deepened the bond', 'It took the party’s co-founder U Tin Oo, the former general who once served Ms Suu Kyi’s father in the Burmese army and who wears his 89 years as if they were 30 years fewer, to climb on the stage high up the scaffolding and pour cold water on the euphoria', 'Such sweeping success, repeated across the rest of the country, will give the NLD close to 70 per cent of seats in parliament’s two houses, and a strong chance of seeing its presidential candidate – which cannot be Ms Suu Kyi, but could be her chosen proxy – elected to the executive presidency, where true power resides, in January', 'The issue over advance votes taps memories of a previous election in 2010, which the NLD boycotted and the USDP won by what the Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group called “massive manipulation” of the count, particularly of advance votes', 'It has been described as the most difficult constitution in the world to change, requiring at least one of the military MPs to defect, then a national referendum', 'To the delight of the crowd the NLD announced sweeping victories across Yangon, Mon State and the Irrawaddy Delta', 'But the basic, and in Ms Suu Kyi’s view, most urgent task is to reform a constitution which not only bars her from the presidency, but locks in place the military’s control of the country, giving it 25 per cent of parliamentarians, control of three key ministries, and ceding ultimate power to a Defence and Security Council, more than half of whose members are soldiers', 'Voting in the election was for the most part trouble-free, despite religious tensions fanned by Buddhist nationalists whose actions intimidated Myanmar’s Muslim minority in the run-up to the poll', 'The acting chairman of the USDP has told BBC Burmese that he has lost his own seat in the constituency of Hinthada to the NLD -

"– Never wear white after Labor Day or, if you're an Australian newscaster, on the same day that your co-worker is. Nine Network's Julie Snook found this out the hard way when she was verbally attacked while the cameras were rolling (but before they went on the air) by colleague Amber Sherlock after both women showed up for their segment donning white outfits. A third white-wearer, psychologist Sandy Rea, also appears in the clip, which went viral after someone leaked it both internally and also to the Mumbrella website, which aired the footage this week. Sherlock was on Friday to be hauled before the network's national news director, as well as HR, and the network is also trying to figure out how to penalize the person who circulated the video internally (it still doesn't know who passed it to Mumbrella), News.com.au reports. In the clip, Sherlock berates Snook for her attire, demanding she put on a jacket and telling her she told her not to wear white ""two hours ago."" Snook remains calm, saying she'll put on a jacket (she did), but noting she ""genuinely forgot"" about Sherlock's request, that she's technically wearing blue, and that Sherlock should chill out. ""Amber, please, this is not the only thing I'm doing today,"" she says in exasperation. After the video got around, the hashtag #putyourblazersonforjulie popped up on social media, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Meanwhile, both women have responded to the dust-up via statements to 9Honey, with Sherlock saying she probably ""overreacted"" and that ""live TV can be a pretty stressful beast.""

"– Diane Rehm is a distinctive voice beloved by the 2.6 million people who listen to her NPR show. She's also made the ethically precarious choice to become a voice in the right-to-die debate, and it's personal: As the Washington Post reports, the 78-year-old Rehm ran smack into the question of how to end life with dignity last year when her husband of 54 years, John, after a physically devastating battle with Parkinson's that would only get worse, decided his time had arrived. But because the couple lived in Maryland, which is not a right-to-die state, his doctor refused to help him end his life. And with Diane Rehm's high profile, her husband felt he could not ask her to help him. Which left John Rehm just one option: Stop eating and drinking. He did. His death took 10 days. ""I feel the way that John had to die was just totally inexcusable,"" Rehm tells the Post. ""It was not right."" Rehm is publicly working with end-of-life organization Compassion & Choices, and she's using her story—which she recounted to NBC last year—to help raise funds for the cause; she tells the Post she'd testify before Congress if asked. ""She brings gravitas, she brings her experience, and she brings a level of reason and sanity to this discussion that is severely lacking when you look at the opponents of death with dignity,"" says an expert with the University of Vermont, which is in one of only three states with right-to-die laws on the books. Rehm has also discussed the subject on her show. ""As strongly as I feel, I don’t want to use the program to proselytize my feelings,"" she said, but with cases like Brittany Maynard stoking national debate, she says, ""I do want to have more and more discussion about it because I feel it’s so important.""

Miami-Dade County police officers, K-9 units, and federal agents could be seen entering the Opa-locka mail sorting and distribution facility, WPTV reports. The US Postal Service directed law enforcement to the facility after discovering some of the packages passed through the facility, but since Opa-locka handles hundreds of thousands of packages from Florida and further afield daily, the source of the packages remains unclear, reports the Miami Herald. Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that the packages ""originated, some of them, from Florida."" She added: ""I am confident that this person or people will be brought to justice."" The number of packages intercepted rose to at least 10 Thursday when pipe bombs sent to Robert De Niro and Joe Biden were found, and authorities have warned that there could be more out there. None of the packages exploded, and although they contained batteries and timers, authorities say they would not have blown up when opened. Law enforcement officials tell the AP that it's unclear whether they were poorly designed or were never intended to explode.

"– Yesterday's Apple event included big revelations about the Apple Watch, not the least of which is that the most expensive model will start at $10,000. And that's a shame, writes Robinson Meyer at the Atlantic. Considering that Apple has catered to ""misfits and rebels"" for much of its almost 40-year history and was fighting off bankruptcy less than two decades ago, this latest move feels ""a little different,"" Meyer writes. During yesterday's event, the Apple Watch was showcased on the wrist of supermodel Christy Turlington Burns, who runs half-marathons around Kilimanjaro when she can get away from her philanthropic work in Tanzania. That's just one example Meyer cites of yesterday's marketing, most of which was ""tailored to an aloof elite."" Apple products have never been cheap, but they stayed ""within reach of a middle-class American,"" Meyer notes. But the 18-karat-gold Apple Watch Edition is clearly out of grasp for most. ""The prices grate,"" Meyer writes. ""And they grate not because they're so expensive, but because they're gratuitously expensive."" As the Edition model will ""have the same innards"" as the $349 Apple Watch Sport, ""the only difference is that Apple is manufacturing a status symbol with the Edition.""

"– The amount of weight a mom-to-be gains during pregnancy may have a link to the weight of the child she bears, a new study finds. Gaining either too much or too little weight can both result in a greater chance that child will be obese, LiveScience reports. The research followed 4,145 women and their kids between ages 2 and 5. What they found: Women with a normal body mass index before pregnancy are advised to gain 25 to 35 pounds; those who gained less were 63% more likely to have an overweight or obese kid. Moms in that group who gained more than that recommended amount were 80% more likely to have an overweight or obese kid. Of all women who gained less than the recommended amount of weight, some 19.5% had overweight or obese kids. Of those who gained more, 20.4% had kids in that category; that's compared to 14.5% of kids whose moms gained the recommended amount of weight. Why? ""Gaining either too little or too much weight in pregnancy may permanently affect mechanisms that manage energy balance and metabolism in the offspring, such as appetite control and energy expenditure,"" a researcher says.

"– This might take some heat off Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has been cast as something of a villain in the firing of FBI chief James Comey. President Trump tells NBC News that he planned to fire Comey anyway, even without the critical memo written by Rosenstein. ""I was going to fire Comey,"" he tells Lester Holt. ""Regardless of the recommendation, I was going to fire Comey."" He went on to call Comey a ""grandstander"" and a ""showboat."" Trump did not address why the White House has previously cited the Rosenstein memo for the move. Sean Spicer, for example, said of the firing and Rosenstein's role: ""It was all him,"" per Slate. And VP Mike Pence on Wednesday referred to the ""president's decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove Director Comey,"" per CNN. In the NBC interview, Trump also said that he'd asked Comey whether he was under investigation, and Comey had told him he wasn't. ""I said, if it's possible would you let me know, 'Am I under investigation?' He said, 'You are not under investigation.'"" He said he had no intention of meddling in the FBI's investigation of any Russian role in the election and said he wanted the truth uncovered. And he reiterated that he fired Comey not because of that investigation but because he thought Comey was doing a bad job. ""He's a showboat, he's grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil,"" Trump said. ""You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that.

"– Authorities at Salt Lake City International Airport are trying to figure out how a man who swiped a boarding pass that a female passenger had accidentally left in a kiosk was able to get past security. Michael Salata, 61, was able to check in at the boarding gate for a Southwest Airlines flight to Oakland and he was only caught when the real passenger, who was a little way behind Salata in line, showed a replacement boarding pass she had on her phone, reports the Deseret News, which notes that it is not clear whether Salata made it onto the plane. Police say Salata, who is homeless, could be charged with ""fraudulent handling of a recordable writing,"" which is a third-degree felony in Utah, the News reports. A Southwest Airlines spokeswoman tells the News that TSA security screeners are ""tasked with verifying a passenger’s boarding pass and identification"" before the passenger can get to a boarding gate, and it was Southwest's own system that caught Salata by flagging that his boarding pass had already been scanned. It is not clear why Salata—who was placed on the sex offender registry in 2012 after a charge of lewdness involving a child—wanted to board the plane, but officials say he wasn't carrying anything that would have made him a security risk, the AP reports.

"– Matt Groening has decided to pull the plug on acclaimed comic strip Life in Hell, 34 years after he started it and many years after its anthropomorphic rabbits and gay lovers were eclipsed by his other creations. Groening, 58, started the strip when he was a struggling artist in 1978 and kept producing it weekly even after becoming a multimillionaire, although cuts to comic pages nationwide saw its circulation fall to fewer than 40 publications from a peak of 380. In the mid-80s, Groening was asked to animate the strip's characters for the Tracey Ullman Show, but, unwilling to hand over the rights to his creations, came up with new characters—the Simpsons. In a Rolling Stone interview, Groening says he kept doing the strip because he enjoyed ""one slice of my creative output being completely solo,"" and because he ""dug in his heels"" when a sneering TV executive asked him why he bothered to continue with it.

"– The Arctic's current warming trend is the worst it's experienced in at least 44,000 years—and possibly even longer—a new study has concluded. Scientists examining vegetation in the Canadian Arctic found recently-exposed moss that, based on radiocarbon dating, was between 44,000 and 51,000 years old—meaning the ice surrounding it hadn't melted in at least that long, Scientific American reports. ""Our study pushes the clock way back,"" says one researcher at the University of Colorado. What's more, because radiocarbon dating is only accurate to about 50,000 years, and geological records show a glacial period preceding that, it's probable that current temperatures actually haven't been seen in 120,000 years, the lead researcher tells Phys.org. That the ice is melting now, but failed to melt during the extremely warm Holocene Thermal Maximum, is a sign that this isn't natural variance, and is almost surely caused by greenhouse gases, he adds. ""Nothing else out there can explain it.""","['The ice cores showed that the youngest time interval from which summer temperatures in the Arctic were plausibly as warm as today is about 120,000 years ago, near the end of the last interglacial period', ""The study is the first direct evidence the present warmth in the Eastern Canadian Arctic exceeds the peak warmth there in the Early Holocene, when the amount of the sun's energy reaching the Northern Hemisphere in summer was roughly 9 percent greater than today, said CU-Boulder geological sciences Professor Gifford Miller, study leader"", 'The study provides the first ""direct"" evidence that Canadian Arctic temperatures in the last century exceeded the peak warmth of that earlier thermal maximum, the scientists said', 'Miller and his colleagues compiled the age distribution of 145 radiocarbon-dated plants in the highlands of Baffin Island that were exposed by ice recession during the year they were collected by the researchers', ""During that time, about 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, the eastern Canadian Arctic was closer to the sun in the summer than now, because of natural variabilities in Earth's orbit"", ""Based on the Earth's current position in relation to the sun, the region should be cooling in the summer, not warming, he said"", 'Therefore, the scientists determined that the last time the vegetation appeared was during melting of the ice caps', 'Located just east of Greenland, the 196,000-square-mile Baffin Island is the fifth largest island in the world', 'Scientists have long known that the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe, even as they had less of a grasp of how recent trends compare to thousands of years ago', 'That means that average summer temperatures now are unprecedented in the region in comparison to the past 44,000 years, the study said', 'To reconstruct the past climate of Baffin Island beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating, Miller and his team used data from ice cores previously retrieved by international teams from the nearby Greenland Ice Sheet', 'The National Science Foundation provided the primary funding for the study', 'The scientists concluded that the level of warming now matches or goes beyond what occurred during a natural warm period about 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, known as the Holocene Thermal Maximum', 'Their old age means that the ice caps entombing them had not melted for at least that long, staying colder than the present day through the peak warmth of the Holocene thermal maximum', 'org) —The heat is on, at least in the Arctic', 'The scientists benefited from a discovery of vegetation on Baffin Island in the Canadian territory of Nunavut', 'A 2012 study by Miller and colleagues using radiocarbon-dated mosses that emerged from under the Baffin Island ice caps and sediment cores from Iceland suggested that the trigger for the Little Ice Age was likely a combination of exploding tropical volcanoes – which ejected tiny aerosols that reflected sunlight back into space – and a decrease in solar radiation', '""Although the Arctic has been warming since about 1900, the most significant warming in the Baffin Island region didn\'t really start until the 1970s,"" said Miller']"

""In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign,"" he said. At rallies in Maine and New Hampshire Friday, Trump did not conceal his glee at what he described as a correction of a ""grave miscarriage of justice."" ""This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and I'm sure it will be properly handled from this point forward,"" he told a crowd in Maine, adding that he hope justice will be ""fully served,"" reports Reuters. Top Republicans including Paul Ryan also welcomed the development, the New York Times reports. ""Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,"" the House speaker said in a statement. ""She was entrusted with some of our nation’s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information."" In a letter to FBI employees, Comey explained his decision to break tradition and inform Congress about a politically sensitive investigation so close to an election. ""I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,"" Comey said. ""I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record."" Politico reports that while it is too early to gauge the impact on Clinton's White House hopes, the race was already tightening and the email development is likely to bring her poll numbers further down. A recent Fox News poll found that 84% of independent voters do not consider Clinton honest or trustworthy. Analysts say that for Clinton, one of the worst aspects of the development is the involvement of Weiner and his multiple sex scandals. He is the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who left him in August. ""The whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption, and scandal,"" Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf tells Reuters.","[""Hide Caption 11 of 43 Photos: Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight

"– Donald Trump may have settled his recent beef with Pope Francis, but there may be a new skirmish brewing between the two—this time over the Nobel Peace Prize. The GOP frontrunner and the pontiff are both among the record number of nominees this year, the Guardian reports. The previous record of 278 nominations in 2014 has been surpassed by the 376—228 people and 148 organizations—suggested this year, a phenomenon that the head of the Nobel Institute suggests is due to so much happening around the globe. ""We live in a world where there are a lot of conflicts and where there are also a certain number of processes that are heading in a more positive direction,"" Olav Njolstad says. ""Clearly, this has inspired a lot of people to exercise their right to nominate someone."" The list of nominees is supposed to remain under wraps for at least 50 years, though names are apparently fair game if the person or group who selected a nominee decides to make that recommendation public. Names already leaked this way include Trump, the pope, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and actress Susan Sarandon (the Wall Street Journal notes Edward Snowden's on the list, too). Only certain people—including members of national assemblies and governments, ex-Nobel laureates, and certain academic and institutional bigwigs—are allowed to cast a nomination, and in Trump's case, his name was offered by an anonymous American who selected Trump for his ""peace through strength ideology,"" the director of Norway's Peace Research Institute tells the Journal (he also notes Trump isn't likely to win). The prize will be announced in October. (One group that's been making headlines in the run for the prize: Greek islanders assisting refugees.)","['As a result, known to be on the list are US Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump, the Colombian peace process negotiators, Pope Francis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, residents of the Greek islands helping migrants, and US actress and activist Susan Sarandon', 'The number of nominees by far exceeds the previous record of 278 in 2014, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said', 'The list also includes Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege, Nadia Murad, a Yazidi abducted by Islamic State fighters in August 2014 from her village in Iraq and held for three months as a sex slave, and the Afghan Cycling Federation women’s team, nominated by a group of Italian MPs hailing the bicycle as environmental, economic and democratic', 'The head of the Nobel Institute, Olav Njolstad said the record number of nominations reflected world events', 'surveillance, are among the record 376 nominees for the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize', 'The names on the list will remain a secret for at least 50 years, unless those who nominated them – MPs and cabinet ministers, former laureates, and some university professors, among others – decide to publicly reveal their candidate', 'Out of the 376 candidates for this year’s award, 228 are individuals and 148 are organizations', 'The name or names of the laureate – there can be a maximum of three – will be announced on 7 October']"
"– A man compensated by the UK government following his release from Guantanamo Bay in 2004 has reportedly died in a suicide bombing targeting a military base in Iraq. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack Monday, sharing a photo of the smiling British suicide bomber it identified as Abu Zakariya al-Britani moments before he is said to have driven one of four explosive-laden SUVs toward the base in Mosul, per the Sun. A relative tells the Times the man is Jamal al-Harith, born Ronald Fiddler. Al-Harith was held at Guantanamo for two years after US forces found him imprisoned by the Taliban in 2002 and determined he had tried to join the terrorist group and was involved in a ""terrorist attack against the US."" But al-Harith was never questioned about an attack and the Taliban viewed him as a British spy, reports the Guardian. He was eventually freed and awarded $1.25 million for alleged mistreatment after the British Home Secretary said he wouldn't be ""a threat to the security of the British people."" A former counterterror strategist for the UK government admits ""we failed to be aware of what Fiddler was up to"" in the years after his release even though he was a ""high-profile figure,"" per the Guardian. Al-Harith's wife previously said he joined ISIS in Syria in 2014. At least two vehicles reportedly penetrated the military base in Iraq on Monday before exploding.

"– There are plenty of people who might benefit from intentionally forgetting certain memories—those who've been in combat, or suffered some form of abuse, for instance, and consequently struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder. Now researchers at Dartmouth report in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin & Review that they've figured out a way to help people do that through ""contextually mediated intentional forgetting."" In less academic jargon: If we want to forget certain memories, we should try to clear our minds of the context related to them. ""It's like intentionally pushing thoughts of your grandmother's cooking out of your mind if you don't want to think about your grandmother at that moment,"" says lead author Jeremy Manning in a press release. ""We were able to physically measure and quantify that process using brain data."" In their brain imaging study of 25 participants ages 19 to 34, researchers found that if they alternated images of words and outdoor scenes—think forests or beaches—and then asked participants to try to forget those words, people tried to ""flush out"" thoughts related to the images. Those who most successfully pushed those images out of mind recalled the fewest number of words. So to forget an awkward conversation, Manning tells Live Science we should try to forget other things that happened in the background as it took place: the song playing, for instance, perhaps by thinking of another song. As Manning puts it, ""If you don't want to think of the color blue, you think of green things instead."" (In other news, memories lost to dementia may be retrievable.)","['Results showed that when the people were asked to forget the words, they tried to push out of their minds thoughts related to the images they had been shown while studying the words', 'The researchers then asked the people to try to either remember the words on the list or forget them', 'For example, if you wanted to forget the details of a conversation you just had, ""you could push out of your mind a song playing in the background, or thoughts related to a scene happening outside your window or something like that,"" said study co-author Jeremy Manning, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire', 'It also turned out that that when the people were told to forget the words, the more they pushed away their thoughts about the images, the fewer words they were actually able to recall later on', 'In the new study, the researchers looked at 25 people ages 19 to 34', 'Although the researchers did not examine the details of the strategies people in the study employed to mentally push out certain thoughts, researchers have previously suggested two main strategies that might help in this process, Manning said', 'In the new study, researchers showed participants images of outdoor scenes, such as forests, mountains and beaches, as they studied two lists of random words, manipulating whether they were told to forget or remember the first list prior to studying the second list', 'However, this pushing out of the images did not occur when the people were asked to remember the words, according to the study, published May 5 in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin & Review', '""Our hope was the scene images would bias the background, or contextual, thoughts that people had as they studied the words to include scene-related thoughts,"" says lead author Jeremy Manning, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth', 'In the study, researchers found that trying to push away your thoughts about the less obvious, background aspects of such memories was key to intentionally forgetting something', ""The study's participants were told to either forget or remember the random words presented to them interspersed between scene images"", 'The study, which included scientists at Bard College and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, was supported by the John Templeton Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation', 'Further, the amount that people flushed out scene-related thoughts predicted how many of the studied words they would later remember, which shows the process is effective at facilitating forgetting', 'The researchers gave the participants lists of words to study while showing them images of outdoor scenes, such as forests, mountains and beaches', ""Meanwhile, the researchers scanned the people's brains to look at their brain activity throughout the experiment"", ""But when the researchers told participants to remember the studied list rather than forget it, this flushing out of scene-related thoughts didn't occur"", '""If you consider the context you experience something in, we\'re really referring to the enormously complex, seemingly random thoughts you had during that experience', ""Those background aspects may include the smells and sounds related to the actual events you'd rather not remember""]"

"– When Oscar Pistorius accidentally fired a pistol in a crowded Johannesburg restaurant, nearly hitting his friend Kevin Lerena, he then asked another friend to take the blame for the incident, Lerena testified at Pistorius' murder trial today. The incident, which came just weeks before Pistorius fatally shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, started when the third friend Darren Fresco passed his pistol to Pistorius under the table, Lerena said. Fresco told Pistorius there was a bullet in the chamber, but Pistorius' lawyer says it was too noisy for Pistorius to hear that, the AP reports. After the shot went off, grazing Lerena's toe, Pistorius apologized to everyone, but as management approached, Lerena says Pistorius beseeched Fresco, ""Just say it was you. I don't want any tension around me. There's too much media hype around me. ... Take the blame because this could be big."" Pistorius' lawyer claims the athlete actually confronted Fresco, angry that the gun was loaded, and Fresco offered to take the blame. Lerena disputed that, the Wall Street Journal reports. Fresco did end up taking responsibility, telling the restaurant owners the gun fell out of his pocket, Reuters reports. In addition to the murder charge, Pistorius faces two charges of recklessly discharging a gun, one of them related to the restaurant incident.

"– The FBI has been warning for a while that the Russians would try to interfere in the midterms, and the Justice Department has just brought a criminal case alleging just that. The feds charged a 44-year-old Russian woman, Elena Khusyaynova, with conspiracy to defraud the US, reports the Washington Post. Prosecutors say Khusyaynova ran an operation funded by a Russian oligarch whose aim was to “spread distrust towards candidates for U.S. political office and the U.S. political system” by bombarding social media with divisive messages on issues from immigration to gun control to the NFL anthem protests. As Politico notes, this is the first criminal case alleging Russian interference in the 2018 elections. Khusyaynova is a foreign national who lives in St. Petersburg, and she was not in custody. Khusyaynova works for an oligarch named Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, described by the New York Times as a close ally of Vladimir Putin who was previously indicted for interference in the 2016 election. She allegedly spent millions in an operation called Project Lakhta, buying advertising on social media, acquiring internet domain names, and pushing ""news postings on social networks."" She and her team also “took extraordinary steps to make it appear that they were ordinary American political activists,” the prosecutors wrote.

"– Thousands of years ago some mosquitoes made ""a really good evolutionary move"": They developed a taste for humans. A new study digs into the genes that led to this evolutionary shift, which had many mosquitoes give up on furry forest animals—and it relied on guinea pigs and pantyhose to reach its conclusion. As Rockefeller University explains, school researchers studied two types of mosquitoes in Rabai, Kenya, whose disparate behavior was first observed in the 1960s. Aedes aegypti formosus (black mosquitoes) favor forest creatures, while the brown-bodied Aedes aegypti aegypti prefer humans. The researchers headed to Rabai five years ago, collected mosquito larvae, and confirmed those preferences were still the case after breeding them in the lab. They then began a process of cross-breeding and sorting that ultimately allowed them to identify an odor-receptor gene, Or4, that was much more highly expressed in human-preferring mosquitoes. To suss out which odor Or4 was homing in on, the researchers had human volunteers and guinea pigs don pantyhose for 24 hours. A machine then sorted out each individual chemical, and one called sulcatone was present only in the stockings worn by humans. But the researchers note that sulcatone alone can't explain the preference; they added sulcatone to guinea pig odor and the brown-bodied mosquitoes showed no increased preference for the odor. Still, the researchers write in Nature that ""our results provide a rare example of a gene contributing to behavioral evolution."" (Meet the parasite that feasts on mosquitoes' blood.)","['After bringing the base of the fly’s antennae into contact with the edge of the coverslip, we used two small drops of UV glue (KOA 300,

"– Most Americans have never heard of sepsis, but the condition hospitalizes a million patients every year—more than heart attack and stroke hospitalizations combined—and is the nation's costliest reason for hospitalization, the Conversation reports. Yet it's hard to diagnose and many doctors don't look for, let alone spot, the deadly condition. So what is it? Often confused with blood poisoning, sepsis occurs when the body responds in a toxic way to an infection (anything from pneumonia to a UTI). As the Sepsis Alliance puts it, ""Your body’s immune system, which is supposed to fight off the infection, goes into overdrive and begins to attack your body."" Sepsis can cause tissue damage or multiple organ failure, landed 400,000 Medicare beneficiaries in ICUs across the country in 2013 alone, and plays a role in 33% to 50% of all US hospital deaths. It cost $5.5 billion for those initial Medicare hospitalizations in 2013, yet triggers return visits 40% of the time. And as far as percentages go, here's another big one: A report based on 2011 data found sepsis ""resulted in an aggregate cost of $20.3 billion or 5.2%"" of what America spent on all hospitalizations that year. Treatment may improve as hospitals create sepsis teams and new prediction tools, as well as investigate treatments; antibiotics and fluids alone can save lives, notes the Sepsis Alliance, which in 2013 reported only 44% of Americans had ever heard of sepsis. Meanwhile, experts are advising people with symptoms like depression, anxiety, forgetfulness, and weakness to seek faster hospitalization. Root causes include smoking, alcoholism, pollution, and pulmonary problems, a professor told Frontline magazine years ago. But problems persist: In Canada, hundreds of malpractice cases in recent years involved sepsis, usually over poor diagnosis, the National Post reports.

"– One of the women who has accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct retells her story in a front-page Washington Post feature that caught the attention of the president himself. ""A woman I don't know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago,"" he tweeted about Rachel Crooks. ""Never happened!"" He added that it makes no sense he would do such a thing in a public place, in view of security cameras. ""Another False Accusation,"" he wrote, adding that the media should instead report on ""the women taking money to make up stories about me."" Crooks maintains that when she was a 22-year-old receptionist at Trump Tower in 2006, Trump ""forced himself on me"" with an unwanted kiss on the lips. Crooks says she went over to Trump to introduce herself as he waited for an elevator. ""He started kissing me on one cheek, then the other cheek,"" she says. ""He was talking to me in between kisses, asking where I was from, or if I wanted to be a model. He wouldn't let go of my hand, and then he went right in and started kissing me on the lips.” The 35-year-old is now telling the story more frequently as she runs in her first political race to become a Democratic state representative in Ohio. The Post story notes that she has asked Trump to release tapes from security cameras that day. Barring that, she cites emails she sent at the time, including to her mom: ""Hey Ma, my day started off rough ... had a weird incident with Mr. Trump.""

"– After some uproar about how the House of Representatives enforces its dress code, Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday he and the House sergeant-at-arms will work to update it. The dress code calls for professional attire in the House chamber and the Speaker's lobby, and some female journalists have recently not been allowed to enter the Speaker's lobby due to sleeveless dresses or open-toed shoes. Critics say the dress code is selectively enforced; GOP Rep. Martha McSally even did so Wednesday during a speech on the House floor. ""The sergeant-at-arms was simply enforcing the same interpretation of the rules as under my predecessors,"" Ryan said, per the Hill. ""It's nothing new and certainly not something that I devised. At the same time, that doesn't mean that enforcement couldn't stand to be a bit modernized."" Politico notes that the dress code has also been called sexist, and adds that female Democrats were considering a protest. In other dress code news, Goldman Sachs has relaxed its own dress code—at least for one class of employees. Tech employees are now allowed to ""exercise judgment in determining when to adapt to business attire,"" per a memo from late June obtained by Reuters Thursday. Though the memo didn't specifically say whether the techie ""uniform"" of hoodies and sneakers would be deemed acceptable, Reuters notes that the move was designed to attract talent to its tech division via a more casual environment.

"– Nina Pham beat Ebola; now she's taking on the place where she caught it. Pham, who contracted the virus while caring for dying patient Thomas Eric Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, tells the Dallas Morning News that she is suing the parent company of the hospital that made her a ""symbol of corporate neglect."" Among her accusations: A lack of training. Pham says the only Ebola training that nurses caring for Duncan initially received was a printout of guidelines her supervisor had found online, and all she knew about the disease was what she had learned in nursing school years earlier. A lack of equipment. Pham says the hospital at first did not supply proper protective gear, leaving nurses with their skin exposed, and nurses were only given hazmat suits after days of asking for them. She says decisions about protective gear had to be made by the nurses themselves ""on the fly."" No respect for privacy. Pham says that after she was placed in an isolation unit, the hospital not only disregarded her request not to have her name released—it also didn't ask her permission before giving the media a video of her taken by a doctor. Her lawyer tells the Morning News Pham was treated as a ""PR pawn"" and was asked about a media release ""about how much she loves Presbyterian"" on the same day a note was added to her medical files saying ""she does not have the mental capability to make end-of-life decisions."" The 26-year-old was declared Ebola-free in October, but she tells the Morning News she still suffers lingering problems, including insomnia, body aches, and hair loss. She has been warned that the aftereffects of experimental drugs used to treat her could include organ failure and vision loss, and she isn't sure if she'll be able to have children—or work as a nurse again.

"– They're called ""ultra-small bacteria,"" but ""ultra-small"" doesn't seem to do them justice. Instead, try ""about as small as life can get,"" write researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. They managed to capture the first-ever image of such an organism, no small feat given that the cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns. Translation: You could fit 150,000 of them on the tip of a single human hair. This is ""the smallest a cell can be and still accommodate enough material to sustain life,"" says the research team. Scientists have debated whether these things actually exist for about 20 years now, notes UPI. And while the argument may have been settled, researchers still don't quite grasp their role. ""These newly described ultra-small bacteria are an example of a subset of the microbial life on earth that we know almost nothing about,"" says Berkeley's Jill Banfield. ""They probably play important roles in microbial communities and ecosystems, but we don't yet fully understand what these ultra-small bacteria do.” Scientists collected the microbes from filtered groundwater in Colorado, flash-froze the samples for transport to the lab, and took advantage of advances in electron microscopes to capture the image of the organism and sequence its genome.

"– Bobbi Kristina Brown's case is tragic, but accidental—right? Law enforcement officers in Georgia aren't so sure, TMZ reports. Sources say a criminal investigation is focusing on Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon and the pair's reportedly violent relationship. More specifically, authorities are looking into injuries sustained by Brown and a possible argument between them an hour before Brown was found unresponsive in a bathtub.

Soon after, Lomas found Brown in the tub and Gordon ""ran in and administered CPR,"" says TMZ. ""We're told Max claims Nick allegedly cleaned up the home and removed blood stains.""

"– Those calling for a ""fix"" are getting it, Indiana's top Republicans said at a press conference this morning. Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma announced changes this morning that ""clarify"" the state's controversial new religious freedom law and aim to protect gays and lesbians. ""We're here to announce that it's fixed,"" Bosma said, though he insisted the compromise language wasn't needed to change the actual law, but ""to clarify the perception"" of that law. The compromise measure states that the law can't be used to discriminate against customers of a business based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, the Indianapolis Star reported earlier. Churches and other nonprofit religious organizations, including schools, are exempted, but the protection does extend to housing and employment. The proposal is officially being presented to lawmakers now that the press conference is over, the Star notes. The measure was put together by GOP leaders alongside business leaders, and Gov. Mike Pence's chief of staff met with the group late yesterday, but no one has said whether Pence will sign it, and the chief of staff said last night that the governor still needs to review it. But, the Atlantic notes, Pence did say Tuesday that he wanted to sign such a clarifying bill, and that he wanted it by week's end. Asked if there are enough votes to pass the compromise in the legislature, both Bosma and Long gave a firm ""yes."" They also both made it clear they believe they've satisfied both sides of the debate, but the Star noted earlier that the deal ""is unlikely to make either liberal or conservative activists"" 100% happy. Asked specifically about the case of the pizzeria refusing to cater a gay wedding, Bosma said, ""We can unequivocally say that RFRA cannot be used to discriminate against anyone,"" but individual cases of how people attempt to use it will be decided by the courts.","['""The freedom of religion for every Hoosier is enshrined in the Constitution of the United States and in the Indiana

"– Dear tired moms of the world: Meet Wisdom, whose dozens of young ones are about to gain another sibling. The Guardian notes that while it may indeed seem ""preposterous"" for a 68-year-old human to still be having kids, it's apparently different for some birds, including this Laysan albatross that's about to witness her 37th egg hatch at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has confirmed the existence of the new egg at the refuge, where Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, have headed to once a year for the past 12 years to mate, per Smithsonian.com. An ID band was first placed on Wisdom in 1956 by birder Chandler Robbins, who himself died just last year at the age of 98. That band has made it possible for researchers to keep tabs on Wisdom over the decades, offering invaluable insight into the albatross's habits in the wild. What makes Wisdom somewhat ""exceptional"" even among her own kind is that most albatrosses, which can only lay one egg a year, don't typically do so annually, as the process of taking care of it is a grueling one. Wisdom, however, ""has bred for a number of years consecutively and has not taken a break,"" a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist says. Also noteworthy: Wisdom was able to create this egg with the help of her ""longtime lover"" Akeakamai, and the Guardian dives further into just how seriously albatrosses take their romantic relationships, engaging in yearly courting rituals to keep the fires burning. (We've heard from Wisdom before.)","['The fish and wildlife service estimates that Wisdom has clocked more than 6m miles in her travels – according to the Cornell lab of ornithology, Laysan albatrosses can range anywhere from the Aleutian Islands and the southern Bering Sea to Costa Rica', 'The birds spend 90 percent of their lives in the air and at sea, making them difficult to track, but bird surveys and banding projects can help researchers gain a better understanding of albatross migratory patterns and life cycles', 'The USFWS has confirmed that Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, are looking after a new egg, taking turns between tending to the nest and searching for food', 'Midway Atoll, a two-and-a-half-sq-mile island belonging to the US that was the site of the decisive Battle of Midway during the second world war, remains mostly uninhabited when it comes to humans', 'Wisdom, a 68-year-old Laysan albatross believed to be the world’s oldest known wild bird, has returned to her home at the Midway Atoll national wildlife refuge for yet another winter – and laid yet another egg to add to the already impressive brood that she has built up over an impressive lifetime', 'To a human, 68 years old may seem preposterous to still be laying eggs, but Wisdom and the other few documented examples of albatrosses in their 50s and 60s who do not appear to have trouble breeding at that age show the situation may be different for birds, said Beth Flint, a USFWS wildlife biologist', 'And so albatross like Wisdom, who has been raising chicks for decades, are vital to the health of the species', 'The biologist and bird met again in 2002 when he went to band her and recognized that she had been one of the 8,400 birds he recorded during his first season, 46 years previously', 'Robbins died last year, but biologists are continuing to keep a close eye on her and the other albatross that regularly flock to the atoll', 'While researchers are still collecting data regarding the frequency at which Laysan albatrosses breed, Wisdom “does seem to be exceptional in that she has bred for a number of years consecutively and has not taken a break”, Flint said', 'But albatrosses are believers in co-parenting, and will take turns incubating an egg, caring for the chick and foraging for food over the ocean', 'Albatrosses are known for their long life spans and often outlive their researchers – Robbins died in 2017 at the age 98 – but what makes Wisdom unique is that researchers have been able to monitor her habits for so long', 'Because albatross are not prolific breeders, the success of each egg is important to the overall population', 'Once they’ve met their mates, the birds will rendezvous at the same nest site every winter – and go through some iteration of the courtship process again, Flint said', 'And at the ripe old age of 68, she has laid yet another egg, according to Gizmodo’s Ryan F', 'Laysan albatross are also vulnerable to predation by dogs, cats, mongoose and even invasive mice, which have been known to attack the birds while they nest', 'As is typical for the species, the couple has laid just one egg, and if all goes well, they will care for the hatchling for around five and a half months before it sets off on its own', 'Biologists with the US Fish and Wildlife Service think the almost-septuagenarian has birthed and raised as many as 36 chicks over the years', '“Every square foot of land, and much of the ground underfoot is occupied by a nesting bird,” Beth Flint, a biologist with the U', 'Like many albatrosses, Wisdom returns nearly every year to the place she was born for nesting and mating', 'She may or may not be the oldest wild bird, but she is the oldest known wild bird, and her habits have been lovingly documented by the fish and wildlife service over social media']"
"– A new Gap ad is causing a stir on social media for what critics say is a racist depiction of a young black girl, Fortune reports. The photo features the child and three white girls. While the two girls bookending the photo strike acrobatic poses, the white girl in the middle stands next to the black girl with her elbow on the smaller girl's head—making it appear, some say, like the child is an ""armrest."" The Washington Post reports the promo is part of a larger GapKids campaign in collaboration with Ellen DeGeneres, meant to showcase ""girls can do anything,"" but the paper notes that in the campaign's commercial, the black child is also on display with ""seeming passivity,"" sitting reticently while the other girls chat with DeGeneres.

The white girl, Fanny, 12, is the biological daughter of Smith and husband Steve Lubensky, and the black girl is 9-year-old Lucy, adopted from Ethiopia by the couple in 2008, per People. Smith tweeted: ""girl with arm resting on her shoulder is her sister She didn't talk in video because she was 2 shy. everyone needs to calm down."" Some replies to her tweet softened after hearing that news, but others said the relationship shouldn't matter. ""She deserved better. That is our point,"" one commenter wrote. A Gap spokeswoman apologized: ""We appreciate the conversation that has taken place and are sorry to anyone we've offended.""

"– House ""masters""—the faculty member attached to each of Harvard's undergrad residences—will soon be no more after a unanimous vote by the 12 people who currently hold the title, the Harvard Crimson reports. Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana made the announcement at Tuesday's monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences. He informed attendees that administrators will soon meet to decide on a label to replace the term ""master,"" which, although often used to indicate ""teacher,"" had caused controversy for its association with slavery. Per the Crimson, the name change is partly in response to several high-profile cases of racial tension on college campuses nationwide, including the ongoing Halloween debacle at fellow Ivy Yale. ""We cannot ignore the fact that the term 'master' has a particular salience in our culture given the very real brutal history of slavery,"" the master of the college's Winthrop House says.

"– The city of Stockton, Calif., will today file for bankruptcy, becoming the largest city in the US ever to do so, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Stockton, a river port and agricultural city of nearly 300,000 about 90 miles east of San Francisco, became a victim of California's housing crash. During the mid-2000s economic boom, the city—long mired in poverty—attempted to reinvent itself, building a new marina and sports complex, fancy hotel, new housing tracts, and promenade on credit. Today, those posh areas are blocks away from dangerous, violent neighborhoods, the Los Angeles Times reports, and the rate of foreclosure is the second-highest in the nation. ""All that's left is sadness,"" said the town's retired fire chief after last night's 6-1 council vote in favor of bankruptcy. The city cut the police department by 25%—and last year saw a record-setting 58 homicides; there have been 31 so far this year, the BBC reports. The fire department was cut by 30%, and other city employees by 40%. Employee pay and benefits, once perhaps overly generous, were also cut. Stockton also has the state's second-highest rate of violent crime and an unemployment rate higher than 15%. Many city buildings have been repossessed, including City Hall. ""Wells Fargo Bank took over a few parking garages that the city owned,"" says one local. ""Now they own the building City Hall is in. You might well call it Wells Fargo town.""","['more Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Image 6 of 9 Councilman, Paul Canepa, and the rest of the Stockton City Council begin the meeting with the Pledge to the Flag, before taking citizen comments and voting on wether to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday June 26, 2012, in Stockton, Calif', 'less Councilman, Paul Canepa, and the rest of the Stockton City Council begin the meeting with the Pledge to the Flag, before taking citizen comments and voting on wether to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday June 26,', 'more Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Image 8 of 9 The Stockton City Council listens to citizen comments before voting on bankruptcy for the city on Tuesday June 26, 2012, in Stockton, Calif', 'The Californian city of Stockton has become the largest US city in decades to file for bankruptcy, after failing to make a deal with its creditors', 'The current City Hall, built in 1926, is decrepit, with cracks in the concrete and rats in the halls', 'more Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Image 4 of 9 Mayor Ann Johnson and the Stockton City Council, bow their heads for the invocation, before voting on wether to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday June 26, 2012, in Stockton, Calif', 'Regarding the cuts to retiree health care, which drew the most heat from the crowd and regret from the council members, he said, ""It\'s the equivalent of cutting off your arm to save the rest of the body', 'more Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Image 5 of 9 City Manager, Bob Deis arrives in chambers, as the Stockton City Council prepares to vote on wether to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday June 26, 2012, in Stockton, Calif', 'The city has the second-highest rate of foreclosures in the country and the second-highest rate of violent crime in the state', 'less The Stockton City Council listens to citizen comments before voting on bankruptcy for the city on Tuesday June 26, 2012, in Stockton, Calif', 'Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Image 2 of 9 Stockton residents arrive in chambers before the City Council prepares to vote on whether to file for bankruptcy', 'The stated purpose of AB 506 — to forestall a municipal bankruptcy — failed, but several bankruptcy attorneys said the mediation may help Stockton avoid the string of lawsuits that faced the smaller city of Vallejo, which recently emerged from a bankruptcy case filed in 2008', 'Bankruptcy became the only option after the city failed to erase a $26 million deficit or to renegotiate millions of dollars it owes in retiree health benefits and on huge civic projects it built in the past decade', 'less Mayor Ann Johnson and the Stockton City Council, bow their heads for the invocation, before voting on wether to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday June 26, 2012, in Stockton, Calif', ""I'm relocating due to the current unchanging status of the city"", ""The city is built on an inland waterway, navigable to the nearby San Joaquin River, where the produce of California's fields are transported from Stockton's port"", 'Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Image 3 of 9 City Manager, Bob Deis listens as the Stockton City Council takes citizen comments before voting on wether to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday June 26, 2012, in Stockton, Calif', '""But how about the ones who mowed the lawns, went in the sewers, typed my letters?

"– Facebook's latest trouble is only getting worse. The company's stock slid nearly 7% on Monday, the biggest decline in four years, as it deals with allegations that it allowed people's personal data to be manipulated during the 2016 campaign, reports the Wall Street Journal. The new scandal specifically involves the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, which worked for the Trump campaign and is accused of improperly obtaining the data of 50 million Facebook users without much trouble. The story continues to widen: Different: The details of this mess are complex, ""but the most important thing to understand is that Facebook collects an enormous amount of data about its users, and it lost control of that data,"" writes Rhett Jones at Gizmodo. Yes, Facebook has weathered similar controversies, but this feels different, he adds. For one thing, lawmakers in the US and Europe are demanding accountability, raising the prospect of investigations, hearings, and penalties. Stephen Colbert: The late-night host weighed in on the scandal Monday, declaring that ""free will is an illusion."" Cambridge Analytica reportedly created psychological profiles so it could bombard users with targeted ads and stories. Colbert takes Facebook to task for allegedly being informed of these tactics and failing to stop them. See the video. Where's Zuckerberg? Silent so far amid the scandal is Mark Zuckerberg, notes Julie Carrie Wong at the Guardian. He might not want to wait too much longer: The hashtag #WheresZuck was trending, as was #DeleteFacebook. Similar theme: The editorial page of the New York Times also takes Facebook to task for its response and thinks lawmakers should look into whether the company violated its own 2011 consent decree with the FTC about protecting users' data. ""It is clear that lawmakers cannot rely on the company to police itself."" Facebook turmoil: The company's chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, is leaving after meeting resistance in his push for the company to be more transparent in how it was used to spread disinformation, reports the New York Times. What to know: The BBC has a question-and-answer primer on the entire scandal, including background on Cambridge Analytica and the quiz it used to get information from Facebook users. Among the explanations is how to protect your privacy on the site. Dirty tricks: Britain's Channel 4 has undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica execs boasting of using underhanded tactics to sway elections around the world, including the use of prostitutes and bribery.

"– eHarmony is pretty serious about about pairing ""deeply compatible singles,"" but if its 29 Dimensions® of Compatibility can't find you your perfect mate, the dating site will soon offer a Plan B: Pay $5,000 for eH+, which lands you your very own personal counselor for a year who will essentially be your human matchmaker. Except the ""you"" in that equation has to be someone with money: The service, which officially launches Dec. 1, is geared for those who pull in a quarter-of-a-million a year. Quartz talks to an eHarmony VP about the offering, and this quote may not do much to bolster the confidence of everyone else using the service: ""It's too hard for a computer to take two people and understand what they want from a physical standpoint in a way that really elicits chemistry between them. We think it’s much more likely that a human being can do that sort of thing."" What that $5,000 gets users: a Skype or phone interview with a psychologist or certified marriage counselor, who will then troll the site looking for Mr. or Ms. Right and even screen matches on the phone, reports Fast Company.

"– Japanese fishermen have wrapped up their annual dolphin hunt and slaughter in Taiji cove amid international protests. CNN reports that some 500 bottlenose dolphins were driven into the cove—a larger number than usual, though Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is sticking with its original claim that 250 or so dolphins were involved. As always, some were captured to be sold to aquariums, others slaughtered for their meat, and the rest released; a member of the local fishermen's union says fewer than 100 fell into those first two categories. But Sea Shepherd, which has tweeted and streamed video through the whole hunt, claims that ""many will die at sea from the last 4 days."" It claims that 52 were sold into captivity, 41 were killed, and the remaining 130 to 140 were released. Sea Shepherd has described horrific scenes as dozens of dolphins were dragged into a tent to be slaughtered, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. That tent was apparently an attempt on the fishermen's part to keep prying eyes away. Reuters reports that in advance of the killing they put a tarpaulin in place; blood streamed out from under it. The Japanese government has shrugged off criticism of the hunt from diplomats including US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy.

"– A former Portsmouth, Va., police officer was found guilty of manslaughter Thursday after shooting an unarmed black teen last year—the second fatal shooting of his career. Though Stephen Rankin was charged with first-degree murder, a jury convicted him of the lesser charge and recommended he spend two and a half years in prison, reports the Guardian. He faced up to 10. Prosecutors said Rankin, 36, intentionally killed 18-year-old shoplifting suspect William Chapman in a Walmart parking lot on April 22, 2015, after Chapman resisted arrest. However, Rankin—a US Navy veteran with training in mixed martial arts—said he shot Chapman twice in self-defense as Chapman ""came towards me aggressively"" after a Taser was knocked from Rankin's hand as the two scuffled. ""I felt I needed to save my life,"" he said, adding he immediately gave Chapman CPR. The Guardian reports Rankin also shot and killed an unarmed man from Kazakhstan in 2011, though Judge Johnny Morrison ruled jurors couldn't hear about that since a grand jury declined to indict Rankin. In that case, Rankin said 26-year-old Kirill Denyakin, shot 11 times, reached into his waistband and charged at him. Prosecutors also couldn't share with the jury text messages Rankin sent before Chapman's death; one read ""people are just bad,"" another referenced Sodom and Gomorrah. It's not clear whether Chapman actually stole something from Walmart. Rankin is due to be sentenced Oct. 12, though his lawyers plan to appeal. The Virginian-Pilot reports he's the 13th US officer to have a jury convict him of murder or manslaughter since 2005.","['In the messages Rankin discussed his hatred for his job, declared that “people are just bad”, said the city of Portsmouth “sucks” and alluded to the condemned biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah', 'He said Chapman had been hoping to obtain a high school diploma and potentially enter the military', 'Having apprehended Chapman and placed him over the hood of his patrol car, he said, he shocked the 18-year-old with his Taser when Chapman struggled and tried to get away', 'The officer tried to stop Chapman in the parking lot of a Walmart superstore on the morning of 22 April 2015 to investigate a suspected theft from the store', 'Police documents on the incident indicate that he was seen taking something and then spent time in the store’s bathroom', 'A multicolored scarf was found in his backpack along with a laptop that the Guardian understands belonged to a relative', 'Asked why he chose not to try to physically tackle Chapman, Rankin, a US navy veteran who was trained in mixed martial arts, said he “wouldn’t have been able to win an unarmed fight” against the 18-year-old', 'Rankin took the stand for the second time to speak in his own defense', 'Rankin said he immediately carried out CPR on the 18-year-old to try to keep him alive', 'Rankin said he had a wife and a 13-year-old daughter, had been studying at a college with help from the GI bill since losing his job as a police officer, and hoped to work as a mechanical engineer', 'During the sentencing hearing later on Thursday afternoon, Morales urged jurors to punish Rankin with “every second and every minute of the 10 years that you are able to give him”', 'In a video clip recorded by Rankin’s Taser that was played to the court, Chapman could he heard asking: “You’re going to tase me when I didn’t do nothing?”', 'Then, he said, Chapman “came towards me aggressively” and Rankin opened fire, striking Chapman in the face and chest', 'Yet the prosecution, who needed to prove that Rankin acted with premeditation, appeared hobbled by Judge Johnny Morrison’s ruling shortly before the trial that jurors could not be shown the gloom-laden mobile messages sent by the officer to colleagues in the hours before the shooting', 'The jury of seven women and five men deliberated for 13 hours after hearing four days of detailed testimony from witnesses to the shooting, a series of experts and Rankin himself', 'Rankin had tried to subdue Chapman with his Taser but the weapon was then knocked from his hand, they said', 'Broccoletti said Rankin’s felony conviction was punishment enough and urged jurors not to send him to prison“He has lived an exemplary, professional, responsible, civic-minded life all his life,” said Broccoletti', 'He told jurors that after he approached Chapman, the teenager would not remove one of his hands from his pocket', 'Morrison also ruled that juvenile criminal records Chapman collected between the ages of 13 and 15, including one assault conviction, could not be used by Rankin’s attorneys in the officer’s defense', 'The Taser was knocked from Rankin’s hand and the pair separated, ending up face to face 6ft apart', 'Rankin and his attorneys had insisted, however, that the officer opened fire only as a last resort after Chapman fought with him aggressively and then charged towards him', 'During several hours of testimony on Tuesday, Rankin told jurors that he did not want to hurt or kill Chapman but was compelled to fire']"

"– A high school pitcher in perfect health—and with good college baseball prospects—came down with flu-like symptoms recently and shocked his community by dying of the plague on June 8, the Denver Post reports. Now friends and family in Larimer County, Colorado, are grappling with the unexpected passing of 16-year-old Taylor Thomas Gaes: ""What a sweet, talented, polite young man you raised,"" writes Jennifer Backurz for her family on a page of online tributes. ""He was a very special person. We are heartbroken with and for you."" According to Larimer County Health Department spokeswoman Katie O'Donnell, the 6-foot-4, 210-pound-frame Taylor likely contracted septicemic plague by touching a dead animal on the Gaes family's rural property, or through a flea bite. Plague itself is rare—only seven Americans get it per year—but septicemic plague is particularly hard to find, O'Donnell says. It's also the deadliest strain and requires quick treatment, but doesn't show signs of being plague, CBS Denver reports. Taylor's family made sure their son's name went public so anyone who attended the memorial service on their property would act on flu-like symptoms, says O'Donnell.

"– Eric Clapton says he'll keep doing live concerts this year, though he admits it's become increasingly challenging. One, because nerve damage has given him back trouble and made it hard for his hands to work their magic on his guitar strings, he told BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright on Tuesday. Two, because he may have taken the ""if it's too loud, you're too old"" mantra too seriously in his younger years: The 72-year-old rock legend revealed he's got noise-induced hearing loss that's causing an annoying ringing in his ears. ""The only thing I'm concerned with now is being in my 70s and being able to be proficient,"" he tells Wright, via People. ""I mean, I'm going deaf, I've got tinnitus, my hands just about work."" The Mayo Clinic notes short-term exposure to music at a loud concert can lead to temporary tinnitus, but permanent damage can occur when a musician like Clapton subjects himself to earsplitting performance after performance.

"– Tragedy in the Yukon: A woman and her 10-month-old daughter were killed by a grizzly bear at a cabin in a remote part of the Canadian territory, authorities say. The Yukon Coroner's Service says trapper Gjermund Roesholt was returning to the cabin in the Einarson Lake area Monday afternoon when he was charged by a grizzly bear about 100 yards from the building, the Yukon News reports. After shooting the bear dead, he found the bodies of wife Valérie Théorêt, 37, and their daughter, Adele, just outside the cabin. ""It appears they had been out for a walk when the incident occurred"" some time between 10am and 3pm, the coroner says. Théorêt was on maternity leave from her job teaching at Whitehorse Elementary School. Friends say the couple, who bought a trapline around three years ago, loved the outdoors and saw Théorêt's time off as an opportunity to spend an extended period at the cabin. Fellow trappers say the couple knew what they were doing in the wilderness. ""These are competent bush people. It's not from lack of experience,"" neighbor Brian Melanson tells the CBC. ""It's going to be devastating to the community, because it's going to hit home to everybody.

"– How do you get millions from a Canadian university? Just ask, apparently. A fraudster emailed MacEwan University in 2017 seeking roughly $9 million (USD) and the school sent it right off, the Toronto Star reports. To be fair, the Edmonton school was busy constructing a $137 million building featuring dance halls and music studios, so the request from Clark Builders, a company on the project, made sense. Only after sending the money did MacEwan learn that Clark Builders never received it and the email's purported author hadn't worked there in years. The funds really went to a Montreal bank account that previously held under $60. From there, over $1 million of it went to East Asia and back to appear legitimate—an international route that made it harder for the RCMP to trace. But trace it they did. According to court documents, most of the money returned to Canada as a loan to Vancouver-based Hoi Fu Enterprises Ltd. The loan came from a Chinese company that, via intermediaries, bought Canadian dollars from a supposed Hong Kong company that had received the Montreal money. And presto, Hoi Fu received about $764,000 in loans to help pay a big new mortgage. Luckily, MacEwan recovered over 92% of lost funds, in part by suing Hoi Fu and seizing money from the bank. The school also set up anti-phishing measures to avoid getting fooled again. ""We knew we were at fault ... and we accept that,"" a school rep tells the CBC. No arrests have been reported in the case. (In another story, the so-called ""affluenza"" mom has been charged with money laundering.)","['""MacEwan\'s administration credits the recovery of such a large percentage of the funds — just over 92

"– These may have been the best plane flights of all time: Passengers on two WestJet flights last month got a chance to talk to Santa via video before boarding—and by the time they arrived, the gifts they had asked him for had been bought, wrapped, and were on their way to baggage claim. Fliers en route to Calgary via the Toronto and Hamilton airports were asked to scan their boarding passes before they got on the plane, Fast Company reports. That prompted the appearance of an onscreen Santa Claus, who knew their name and asked what they wanted for Christmas. The 250 passengers were taped by hidden cameras. Once the requests were in, airline employees had roughly four hours to get the items before the planes landed in Calgary, reports Fox News. Some 175 workers for the Canada-based company hurried to stores to get everything from a snowboard to a big-screen TV to (one guy's possibly regrettable request for) socks and underwear. Upon arriving, passengers couldn't believe their eyes. The whole thing was captured on a pretty heartwarming video. And even if there's a PR-stunt aspect to it, it's one that keeps on giving. WestJet said that when the video got 200,000 views, it would donate flights to families via Ronald McDonald House Charities; it's already been seen more than 7 million times.","['""For the first flight, we\'re taking the passengers\' gift requests, sending them to the shoppers in Calgary, and it\'s hectic and crazy and we barely get the gifts on the baggage belt in time,"" says Mills', 'While the plane was in the air, over 150 “merry WestJetters” acted as Santa’s elves, rushing out to stores and nabbing the items on the passengers’ lists, according to a release from the Canadian-based WestJet', '""But as the magic is happening, we have 10 minutes to get the shoppers back out to the stores because, Santa\'s taking the gift orders from the second flight', 'A video of the event, just released, was created for another purpose: Once it reaches 200,000 views, the airline said it would donate flights through Ronald McDonald House Charities to families and children in need', ""The shop produced Westjet's holiday video last year and was asked to come up with something bigger and better for 2013"", ""But I think the reason it's caught on so much is because of how genuine the passengers' reactions are"", '""So we had to leave ourselves enough time and work closely with the security people to make sure we could get the gifts back behind baggage claim in time to get them wrapped', ""The looks on all the passenger's faces, as well as the brand lovefest the video has garnered online so far, makes it look like a win for everyone involved"", 'During the approximately five hours the 250 passengers were in the air, about 175 Westjet employees in Calgary rounded up every single thing Santa was asked for, from socks to a big screen TV', 'And third, never underestimate the power of tears', 'All of that is 100% real and our job was to have our cameras in the position to see those things', 'By the time the flights landed four hours later, the 250 unsuspecting passengers were greeted by a festive display at baggage claim and were handed gifts they had asked for', 'One of the biggest challenges was working and shooting inside three different airports, amid all the obvious security issues', 'For Mills, the success of the video so far has driven home three key lessons', 'We had a few little tricks—there was one area of the baggage carousel that was a bit of a dead spot for our cameras so we had plainclothes Westjet employees stand there to prevent the real passengers from standing there', '""It fits so well with the brand image and personality,"" says Mills', '""We can control where the cameras go and just about everything else, but we can\'t tell people how to react or where to stand', '""The X factor for us was we didn\'t know how the passengers would react,"" says Mills']"
"– A bride and groom from Utah say they barely made it to their own wedding on time after getting kicked off a United Airlines flight. Michael Hohl and Amber Maxwell say they were on their way from Salt Lake City to Costa Rica with friends on Saturday when they boarded their connecting flight in Houston and found a sleeping man sprawled across their row of seats, the Houston Chronicle reports. They say they were the last passengers to board the flight and decided to sit in empty seats a few rows up instead of waking the man. They say they moved back to their assigned seats after a flight attendant asked them to—but then, a US marshal boarded the plane, said they'd been disorderly, and told them to get off. ""It was the strangest thing I have ever had to go through,"" Hohl tells KUTV. He says they decided to comply with the officer's order because they remembered video of passenger David Dao being dragged off a United flight the previous weekend.

"– A 911 dispatcher who reached for a gun instead of a phone when she thought there was an intruder in her home shot her own daughter dead, according to police in St. Cloud, Fla. Police say that in what they're treating as an accidental shooting, the 27-year-old daughter was killed by the single round that her mother fired, reports CNN, which notes that police have asked the media not to identify the family because the mother's husband, a 17-year veteran of the St. Cloud Police Department, has served as an undercover narcotics officer. The mother, an Osceola County dispatcher, has not been charged. In a 911 call made Tuesday night, the husband tells dispatchers that his stepdaughter has ""passed out. She has a pacemaker. She has a heart problem,"" but he doesn't mention that she had been shot, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Police say that was because he was asleep at the time of the shooting and didn't realize what had happened until his wife explained.

"– Ever wondered just how much it sucks to be your grandmother? Well thanks to the folks at the MIT AgeLab, you don’t have to wonder anymore. They’ve created a suit called AGNES—short for “Age Gain Now Empathy System”—that simulates the trials and tribulations that come with your average 70-year-old body, Mashable reports. The suit uses various braces, bands, and other tricks to limit wearers' mobility, and give them a glimpse of senior citizen discomfort. A band from the helmet, for example, helps simulate the curved, compressed spine that comes with aging, while braces limit knee and elbow mobility, and earplugs and yellow glasses dull the senses, according to the project’s official page. The goal? To give product designers, engineers, architects and more insight into how the elderly will experience their work.","['Heavy helmets, neck braces and yellow-tinged glasses create the feeling of achey joints, limited mobility and blurred vision', 'The suit can be worn by students, product developers and engineers for the sake of better design', 'Check out the video above to see suited young individuals having difficulty reaching a low supermarket shelf, reading medicine labels and getting off public buses', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive']"

"– The iPhone 4S looks exactly like its best-selling predecessor, but it has had a major internal revamp. The big news is that the fifth-generation smartphone ""thinks different,"" thanks to its voice-controlled artificial-intelligence system called Siri. Writing for the Wall Street Journal, Walt Mossberg decides Siri is impressive but has ""imperfect accuracy""—it can't read the contents of email or give you movie times. Still, it has potential. It just isn't enough to make the iPhone 4S a game-changer. Others, however, disagree: Writing for the New York Times, David Pogue praises the ""crazy good, transformative, category-redefining speech recognition."" He loves Siri's voice (""uncomplaining,"" ""calm female""), the ease in which you can use it (""you don’t even have to hold the phone up to your head""), and its smarts (when he tried to make a Thursday afternoon appointment, Siri reminded him he already had an all-day meeting scheduled). While he agrees it's not perfect, ""Siri saves time, fumbling, and distraction, and profoundly changes the definition of 'phone.'"" In the Washington Post, Joshua Topolsky heaps similar praise upon Siri, which he calls one of the ""most meaningful updates"" to grace the iPhone. And while he, too, notes that it doesn't work all the time, his assessment is that ""the crazy thing about Siri is that it works ... better than you’d expect. It understands and responds to you in a way that’s so natural it can sometimes be unsettling."" In a very lengthy look at Siri on Daring Fireball, John Gruber heralds it as Apple's return to an ""AI-focused ambition."" Before Siri, ""iOS struck me [as] being designed to make it easy for us to do things. Siri is designed to do things for us."" After a week spent using it, could he live without it? Yes.

"– An amateur archaeologist in North Carolina made headlines last year when she claimed to have uncovered long-lost pyramids in Egypt via Google Earth. Real archaeologists have been a bit more skeptical. But Angela Micol says new discoveries help prove her findings, reports Discovery News. Another amateur archaeologist recently did a ground study at one of the two sites she spotted, and claims what he saw there—pottery, shells, and signs of cavities and tunnels below the the surface—support Micol's claims. ""Those mounds are definitely hiding an ancient site below them,"" he says. Additionally, an Egyptian couple who are leading collectors of old maps and rare documents say they have 34 maps and 12 documents in their collection that indicate the areas of Micol's findings are pyramid sites. The couple says their documents suggest two unknown pyramids at one of the sites, Fayum, were intentionally buried. ""They would be the greatest pyramids known to mankind,"" says the couple. ""We would not exaggerate if we said the finding can overshadow the Pyramids of Giza."" But real archaeologists remain uninterested in Micol's research, so she has set up a crowd-funding campaign to raise $50,000 to explore the site further with a ground penetrating radar and infrared satellite imagery. ""It's very obvious what the sites may contain,"" says Micol, ""but field research is needed to verify they are, in fact, pyramids."" (Click for another fascinating archaeological discovery, this one in Scotland.)","['For the site near the Fayum, they cited three maps in particular -- a map by Robert de Vaugoudy, dating from 1753, a rare map by the engineers of Napoleon Bonaparte, and a map and documents by Major Brown, general of irrigation for Lower Egypt in the late 1880s', 'The couple, Medhat Kamal El-Kady, former ambassador to the Sultanate of Oman, and his wife Haidy Farouk Abdel-Hamid, a lawyer, former counselor at the Egyptian presidency and adviser of border issues and international issues of sovereignty, are top collectors of maps, old documents, books and rare political and historical manuscripts', 'According to the couple, the formations spotted by Micol in the Fayum and near Abu Sidhum were both labeled as pyramid complex sites in several old maps and documents', 'The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine', 'El-Kady and Farouk have made important donations to the Egyptian state and the U', ""Their various gifts to the Library of Alexandria include Al-Sharif Al-Idrissi's map of the Earth drawn for King Roger II of Sicily in 1154"", 'Authoritative geologists and geo-archaeologists were largely skeptical and dismissed what Micol called ""Google Earth anomalies"" as windswept natural rock formations -- buttes quite common in the Egyptian desert', 'One site in Upper Egypt, just 12 miles from the city of Abu Sidhum along the Nile, featured four mounds with an unusual footprint', 'Some 90 miles north near the Fayum oasis, the second possible pyramid complex revealed a four-sided, truncated mound approximately 150 feet wide and three smaller mounds in a diagonal alignment']"
"– Sometimes the solution you're looking for is right in front of your face. For example, if you'd like to save the ponies that roam the moors of southwestern England, perhaps you should ... eat one. This is the suggestion being bandied about by the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association to rescue the pony population there: Their numbers have fallen from 25,000 in the 1930s to fewer than 800 currently, the Telegraph reports. The reason some think the scarf-down strategy will work: It would create a ""sustainable market"" for the ponies. Herders would have an incentive to take good care of their animals if they could eventually sell them as meat, and those not sold as food could be trained for riding and driving. ""Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sales,"" argues Charlotte Faulkner, head of the DHPA. Princess Anne is also an eat-the-pony/save-the-pony advocate for animal-welfare purposes: In a speech to a horse charity last year, she said herd owners would actually treat the animals better if they knew they had to maintain the herds until they were old enough to kill for meat (the ponies have to be at least 3 years old to qualify, notes Faulkner). Other conservation groups are backing the initiative, claiming there are too many abandoned ponies wandering around—unwanted ponies that were being fed to zoo lions and tigers and stripped of their hides to make ""wild pony"" drums, reported the Daily Mail last year. ""Why not promote the free-living Exmoor ponies as a food animal as much as an amenity or aesthetic resource?"" says a horse expert in a report by local advocacy groups, notes the Telegraph. (Horse meat is apparently already in 5% of the beef in Europe.)","['Journalist Sybil Ruscoe visited Dartmoor and followed the journey of the ponies from their slaughter, with bolt guns, to the zoo feeding, and the drum making process, for BBC Radio 4’s On The Farm', 'Now, the autumn ‘drifts’ where the ponies are herded down from the hills to market have resulted in culls, with hundreds of unwanted animals – mainly the very young and the old – being slaughtered', 'Now, The Mail on Sunday can reveal the hides of culled ponies are being crafted into ‘wild pony’ pagan drums – used in Druid-style retreats and musical performances to capture the rhythms of ‘life and the moon’', '‘I see the drums as a symbol of the ponies’ voices … calling you to listen to their cry for support to help them continue looking after Dartmoor', 'Dartmoor ponies are a distinctive, hardy breed, essential to the maintenance of unique moorland landscapes and the rare insects they support', 'Last year, after speaking with Charlotte Faulkner, founder of Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, who has been battling to save the ponies for more than 16 years, she suggested she could use the hides of the culled ponies to make drums', 'But the demand for the ponies at market has been falling – particularly since the recession', ""It maybe be controversial but an animal group is the latest to endorse the Princess Royal's suggestion of eating ponies in a bid to save their species"", 'The SWEP reacted with fury at the letter, saying it would never support the breeding of animals for profit', 'Now, in addition to the zoo programme, the hides of culled ponies are being used to create hand-crafted drums', 'Dartmoor ponies are an essential part of the ecology of the 368 square mile national park in Devon by keeping the gorse on the moorland under control', 'But the controversial zoo programme, set up by Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, claims that selling the meat is a way to raise funds to conserve future herds', '‘We want to encourage people to support the care of these ponies and the drums are a way of doing this', 'A report by the Exmoor Pony Society, the Exmoor National Park Authority and other conservation groups has also backed the initiative after seeing a growing number of unwanted ponies being abandoned on the moor endangering the native pure-bred wild ponies', '""It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them', 'Divide it among the plates, scattering it over the meat, and then eat mixing it with the raw meat and serving buttered sourdough toast, or fine chips, on the side', 'And with this, we are protecting the herds, and the moors', 'In a speech to the World Horse Welfare charity last year, of which she is president, the Princess Royal claimed owners might take better care of their horses if they believed they could sell them for meat', 'In the report, expert Peter Green concluded that the unwanted animals should be killed and sold for horsemeat', 'The French do it, Princess Anne is an advocate and now charities are backing the idea of eating ponies', '‘And we see it as part of a wider regeneration project for the whole region', 'Under Mr Green’s plan the ‘excess’ ponies would be slaughtered, processed and inspected at EU-approved abattoirs in line with red meat regulations before entering the food chain', 'Founder of the DHPA, Charlotte Faulkner believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a ""sustainable market"" for them', 'She describes the resulting 25-minute programme as ‘a hard listen’ – a far cry from the 1930s, when there were said to be 30,000 ponies on the moors', ""However PETA describes process as 'the final indignity' for the unwanted animals"", ""Charlotte Faulkner, founder of Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, said the culling scheme was 'a bitter pill to swallow'"", 'The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) says the best way to save herds on the ancient moorland is by creating a ""market"" for them by eating them', 'It would mean that animals not selected for slaughter could be broken and trained for riding and driving, which she claims is best done from the age of three', '‘It’s a sensitive project and it’s taken a year to get to this stage, as I have been working with other people in the community', '""Transportation and slaughter of horses for meat are issues of particular concern for the RSPCA', 'A spokesman said: ""The killing of horses for meat is an emotive subject as many see them as companion animals rather than a food source, a sentiment the RSPCA has great sympathy with']"
"– Pregnant women already have an exhaustive list of foods they’re told to limit or avoid. But a new longitudinal study might make that list longer. Time reports that research published in the European Respiratory Journal found a link between higher added sugar intake during pregnancy and a child's risk of allergies and allergic asthma. In the study, 9,000 pregnant women completed a food questionnaire that asked about 43 food groups and items. When their children turned seven, the kids were tested for common allergies like cats and grass and the mothers were asked about their kids' history with asthma. The researchers found that moms ranked in the highest 20% of added sugar intake had children twice as likely to have allergic asthma than moms in the bottom 20%. According to New Scientist, allergic asthma is the most common form of the respiratory condition and is caused by allergens that bring on breathing problems. The moms eating the most sugar also had kids 38% more likely to test positive for one allergen and 73% more likely for two or more. While the study didn't prove causation, one theory on how added sugar could up the risk of allergies and asthma is that immune reactions to fructose may bring on inflammation in a developing fetus' lungs. “Given the extremely high consumption of sugar in the West, we will certainly be investigating this hypothesis further with some urgency,” the lead researcher says. (Good news for those with peanut allergies: a skin patch may be on the way).","['“We know that the prenatal period may be crucial for determining risk of asthma and allergies in childhood, and recent trials have confirmed that maternal diet in pregnancy is important,” says first author Annabelle Bedard, a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Primary Care and Public Health at Queen Mary University of London, via email', '“The dramatic ‘epidemic’ of asthma and allergies in the West in the last 50 years is still largely unexplained,” she says', '“We cannot say on the basis of these observations that high intake of sugar by mothers in pregnancy is definitely causing allergy and allergic asthma in their offspring,” says Seif Shaheen, at Queen Mary, University of London, who led the study', 'One theory for how sugar could cause asthma is that large amounts of fructose might trigger an immune response in the body, leading to inflammation in the lungs', 'The researchers only saw weak evidence to suggest a link between women’s added sugar intake and their children’s chances of developing asthma overall', 'Many factors influence a baby’s allergy risk, including exposure to microbes and pollutants, and the type of milk they are fed, says Sheena Cruickshank, at the University of Manchester, UK', 'Read more: Fat vs carbs: What’s really worse for your health?

"– Alex Rodriguez is in a heated battle with the cousin who once allegedly helped him take steroids, and that cousin's wife says A-Rod is an ""evil"" person who peed on a wall of their Miami house to mark his territory. ""He peed outside on my wall, next to the pool. He didn’t ask for the bathroom. He go outside and he just pee right there. He came over, took his thing out and went right there,"" Carmen Sucart tells the New York Daily News. She says the incident happened in the spring of 2012, when Rodriguez came to their home offering them $50,000 and an apartment if they signed a confidentiality agreement; Sucart refused. Her husband, Yuri, is a former baseball personal assistant who was banned by MLB after A-Rod's 2009 juicing confession.

Authorities say Floyd, 39, had beaten her with his gun in a fight Wednesday, and when they struggled for the weapon two bullets fired harmlessly through a wall, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The woman, who remains unidentified, spent a day in bed due to a head injury. Then she convinced Floyd she had to take her dog to DeLand Animal Hospital, so he reportedly went along and threatened to murder her and her family on the drive over.

"– Notes that Mark Twain jotted down from a fairy tale he told his daughters more than a century ago have inspired a new children's book, The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine, the AP reports. At the Mark Twain House and Museum in Hartford, there is excitement that the story could help introduce the writer to wider audiences—and provide a financial lift for the nonprofit organization that curates the three-story Gothic Revival mansion where Twain raised his family. A researcher found the story in the archive of the Mark Twain Papers at the University of California at Berkeley. When the University of California Press passed on taking it to publication, the archive's director, Bob Hirst, endorsed enlisting the Twain House as an agent in part because of financial struggles the museum has had to overcome. ""I don't think it's a secret they need funding,"" Hirst said. ""If it was going to make some money, which Mark Twain would certainly approve of, that house was a good place for it to go."" The Twain House connected the UC Press with DoubleDay Books for Young Readers, which hired an author and illustrator to turn Twain's unfinished notes into the book to be published in September. The book tells the story of a boy who gains the ability to talk to animals by eating a flower from a magical seed and then joins them to rescue a kidnapped prince. The 152-page illustrated book, completed by Philip and Erin Stead, frames the narrative as a story ""told to me by my friend, Mr. Mark Twain.""

The aerial explosive, believed dropped by the RAF, was spotted in the Rhine River as dry conditions lowered water levels. Some 45,000 residents are leaving the area as experts prepare to defuse and remove the 10-foot bomb on Sunday, reports Der Spiegel. Two hospitals, a jail, and seven retirement homes will have to be emptied. It's believed to be the largest evacuation in Germany since the war ended. Workers are building a temporary dam and the area will be pumped free of water.

"– Starting today, Twitter is rolling out a redesigned profile that will eventually hit all users—and basically every report on the redesign is noting the similarity between the new profile pages and Facebook's profile pages. Among the changes: There's now a full header photo (think Facebook's cover photos) and a larger profile photo that appears (and overlaps) at the lower lefthand corner of the header (just like on Facebook). Users will also be able to ""pin"" certain tweets so they always appear at the top of their feed, Venture Beat reports. The idea, as the designer puts it, is followers will be able to see ""what you're all about"" right away. And tweets will be adjusted in size relative to how much others have engaged with them—the more popular ones will appear larger, The Verge reports. When viewing someone else's profile, you can use a filter at the top of the profile to see just tweets, tweets and replies, or tweets that include photos or videos. All new users will get the new profile when signing up, and everyone else will have it within a few weeks. Engadget notes that a few VIPs, including Channing Tatum, already have the new design if you want to check it out.","['Detailed in Twitter’s official announcement, designer David Bellona shares that the new Web profiles will feature a larger profile photo, a header (cover) photo, and the ability to pin your favorite tweets to the top of your profile', 'New users get the redesign right away, but Twitter is going to be rolling out the new look to its entire user base over the course of the coming weeks', 'It shifts profiles slightly further from the linear, time-based end of the spectrum and towards something more akin to Facebook, and is probably designed towards making the service more accessible to new users', 'You can also pin one of your tweets to the top of the page', 'Twitter has been testing a number of redesigns over the past few months, including one that shared the look of the profile rolling out today, but with tiled content instead of a linear stream, and this seems to be a combination of some elements from various test pool buckets', ""Below the profile photo you'll find the basic info about the user, and under that is photos and friends"", 'You can pin a tweet, forum-style, to the top of your ramblings as a sort of extension to your bio, which is less visible under the left-aligned profile pic setup', 'Navigating the tweet streams of others now offers a few more options, including the ability to see just tweets with photos and videos attached, or seeing tweets and replies', ""It'll be interesting to see what the users think of the new look — especially those that are not overly fond of Facebook"", 'Your profile pic and customized header are now larger, and you can tweak your color scheme slightly in terms of link highlights, but you lose the ability to set a custom background image', 'The rest of us will have to wait as the new look rolls out over the ""coming weeks', 'The company announced the overhaul in a blog post today, highlighting its new features, which include a number of new ways to view and interact with Tweets', ""What's the big deal with Channing Tatum, anyway?

"– The person who shut down President Trump's Twitter account for 11 minutes was not a Twitter employee, as was initially reported, but a contractor for the company, two sources tell the New York Times. Asked about the new information, a Twitter spokesperson simply pointed to the company's initial statement (which blamed a ""customer support employee"" on his or her last day at work) and said a full internal investigation is underway. The Times notes that the issue highlights a potential problem for Twitter and other social media companies, which often outsource ""sensitive work"" to third-party contract workers; Twitter employees have expressed concerns that these workers can do things like disable accounts, though the employees say contractors cannot tweet from a user's account or access a person's direct messages. In fact, employees tell the Verge this isn't the first time a departing worker has pulled a stunt like this. ""People have ‘dropped the mic’ in the past and deleted accounts, verified users, and otherwise abused their power on the last day,"" says one employee, noting that none of those incidents became public. Multiple news outlets are expressing concern over Twitter security after the Trump incident, and security experts echo those concerns to the Guardian. One expert says the only surefire way to keep something like this from happening again is to always have two social media employees monitoring each other's actions. According to Twitter, though, steps have already been taken, Fox News reports. ""We have implemented safeguards to prevent this from happening again,"" the company tweeted. ""We won’t be able to share all details about our internal investigation or updates to our security measures, but we take this seriously and our teams are on it.""","['If one customer service employee at Twitter can remove the account of the President of the United States for more than 10 minutes, how susceptible is Trump\'s account to other sorts of pranks and hacks?

"– Posting ""Someone shoot Trump"" is considered unacceptable by Facebook moderators, but more generalized suggestions of violence like ""Kick a person with red hair"" or ""Let's beat up fat kids"" are OK. Those were the examples given in the ""credible violence"" section of secret Facebook guidelines leaked to the Guardian. The ""Facebook Files,"" including training manuals, state that videos of violent deaths, child abuse, or animal abuse are not banned outright. ""Videos of violent deaths are disturbing but can help create awareness,"" the files say. ""We mark as 'disturbing' videos of the violent deaths of humans."" The files reveal that Facebook moderators deal with almost a million reports of fake accounts a day. The guidelines state that child abuse images can be shared in an effort to help identify and rescue the child involved. Animal abuse images can be shared, but not when there's an element of ""sadism or celebration."" People can livestream attempts to self-harm, because Facebook ""doesn't want to censor or punish people in distress."" Facebook declined to comment directly on the files, Reuters reports, but Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert issued a statement saying: ""We work hard to make Facebook as safe as possible while enabling free speech. This requires a lot of thought into detailed and often difficult questions, and getting it right is something we take very seriously.""

"– It's a big day in the tech world as we await the 1pm EDT iPhone announcement from Apple HQ. What do we think we know? It will be faster, slimmer, and have a larger screen: Pretty much everyone agrees on these points. It will run on both GSM and CDMA networks: The Washington Post says this is almost certain. It will have beefier voice navigation: Again, most sources agree on this point. Mashable goes further and explains the feature, called Assistant, artificial intelligence software that can help you find a restaurant, search on Google, call a taxi, and more—all while learning from your actions. It will include Apple's new operating system: iOS 5 and iCloud will offer both free and paid storage in the cloud for photos, movies, music, and apps, the Post notes. Reuters adds that the new iPhone is expected to be loaded with the updated software. It will be cheaper: Reuters notes that some expect a cheaper model that would appeal to the Asian market, in order to boost Apple's growth there, but the Wall Street Journal reports that the price is expected to remain around $199 to $299. TechCrunch, however, believes we will definitely see a cheaper phone—perhaps even less than $100. It will mark Tim Cook's debut: Cook, the new CEO, will have his first chance to prove himself as the main speaker today. Still unknown is whether Steve Jobs will make an appearance. Other questions that remain: Will Apple announce two phones (say, an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 4S) or just one? What about a partnership with Facebook? Any news about the iPod? Will the new iPhone run on 4G networks?

"– WikiLeaks won’t be releasing any more secrets in the near future, Julian Assange announced today; the credit card companies have brought it down. In a statement, WikiLeaks said it was making the move in response to the “blockade” against donations established by banks and credit card companies. “We are forced to temporarily suspend publishing whilst we secure our economic survival,” its website reads today. At a press conference in London today, Assange said the blockade had shrunk its donations from more than $100,000 a month to around $8,000-$9,000, and that if the ban wasn’t lifted the organization would be “simply not able to continue,” according to the Guardian.

"– Even in the vastness of the American West, the glow from cities has become so bright that places with truly dark skies at night are becoming an endangered species. In the continental US, experts predict that in a decade, there will be just three areas where the sky will be dark enough to see the Milky Way clearly, the Arizona Republic reports. One area covers part of eastern Oregon and western Idaho, another includes parts of Nevada and western Utah, a third takes in parts of northern Arizona and southern Utah—and the latter two are in danger from the bright lights of Las Vegas and Phoenix, which can be seen for more than 200 miles. Light pollution not only hinders astronomy, it can disrupt ecosystems and people's sleeping patterns, warns the International Dark-Sky Association. The Tucson-based organization has been trying for years to preserve the West's dark spots, encouraging cities to adopt dark-sky-friendly lighting codes. This month, the group launched a campaign to preserve and promote the dark skies over the Colorado Plateau, stressing its value as a ""celestial treasure and a celestial refuge"" that has attracted visitors for centuries. ""People need the sense of beauty and perspective and awe that we get from our exposure to the universe in a dark night sky,"" Grand Canyon ranger Marker Marshall tells the Republic.

"– Add this to the growing list of Uber controversies: drivers peeing into plastic bottles. Vocativ reports that fed-up Uber drivers in New York City are tired of improvising when forced to answer nature's call. A union representing them has begun an online petition calling on JFK International Airport to install a port-a-potty. ""It’s a grim situation in the waiting lot,"" says driver Sohail Rana, who ups the ewww factor with this description: ""Half-filled bottles of questionable origin and odor litter the cell phone lot, where the only place to go to the bathroom currently is a section … where there are a few anemic bushes.” Uber drivers are barred from using restrooms for licensed taxi drivers, says Ryan Price, chief of the International Drivers Guild, who claims even pets have access to facilities. ""Drivers are being treated worse than dogs."" Seeking out the nearest public loo some two miles away could cost a driver a spot in line, adding to waiting time for a fare. Price said the union is due to discuss the matter with the Port Authority, which operates the airport. The union would like the portable toilet to have running water so drivers can wash their hands and feet (many pray between rides). In the meantime, Uber drivers have taken to online forums to share tips, such as wearing adult diapers, or which bottle is the best to pee in (Gatorade). One man worried on Reddit about being arrested for indecent exposure. Others posted preferred public toilets in various cities. (Walgreens gets high marks.) No stranger to controversy, Uber's recent headlines have included claims employees used customer data to stalk celebrities, and and problems with new self-driving cars.","['The petition asks Port Authority, which operates the airport, to install and maintain a portable restroom in the cell phone lot, the parking space designated for Uber, Lyft and Gett drivers to wait in line and pick up passengers', 'Another thing the guild wants to provide for drivers is a place to wash their feet, since many of them pray in between rides', 'Price said that sanitation is very important to the guild and would like to keep drivers healthy', 'Price said the guild is currently scheduled to meet with Port Authority to try and figure out where a restroom can be placed and find the funding for its maintenance', 'Drivers who don’t leave to use the restroom have found unique ways to take care of their basic needs and still be able to do their job', '“Half-filled bottles of questionable origin and odor litter the cell phone lot, where the only place to go to the bathroom currently is a section of the parking lot where there are a few anemic bushes', 'At the city’s LaGuardia Airport there is a portable toilet and a 7-Eleven nearby, so it’s not as dire for the guild to fight for a restroom installment', 'One time a sports bar owner charted a bus to a football game, I was a manager at a grocery store close to his place and often helped him out with change and bulk orders so I got an invite and two tickets to the game', 'For-hire drivers currently have to find clever ways to urinate or travel at least two miles to find the nearest restroom, according to IDG’s executive director Ryan Price', '30 plus people including 4 woman all got off the bus and relieved themselves right there on the grass next to I 95', 'The Independent Drivers Guild, a union that represents for-hire drivers, started an online petition that asks for the installment of a restroom for drivers to use at New York City’s John F', '“Gatorade is the best pee pee bottle,” is the title of one of the many forums trying to solve this conundrum']"
"– The saga that began with Australia's agriculture minister threatening to kill Johnny Depp's dogs has ended—and nobody was euthanized or sent to prison for 10 years. Instead, Depp's wife, Amber Heard, pleaded guilty to falsifying her immigration card when Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo were illegally brought into the country on their private jet last year, reports the Brisbane Times. Heard was punished with a one-month ""good behavior bond"" of $1,000—she'll have to pay a $1,000 fine if she misbehaves over the next month—and the more serious charge of illegally importing animals into the country was dropped, the Guardian reports. Depp and Heard hugged each other in the Queensland courtroom after the ruling. The courtroom was shown what the Sydney Morning Herald describes as an ""awkward and stilted"" apology video from the couple, in which they stress the importance of Australia's biosecurity laws and urge other travelers not to repeat their mistake. ""Australians are just as unique, both warm and direct. If you disrespect Australian law, they will tell you firmly,"" Depp says in the video, which Mashable writes ""looks like the couple have been held hostage in North Korea."" Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce shared the video to his Facebook page and said he plans to use it to highlight the issue. We ""have had terrible outcomes with the introduction with certain pests, whether it be prickly pear, rabbits, cane toads,"" he told reporters.

"– An analyst declared days ago that ""the race for the House is over,"" with ""zero chance"" of it going to the Dems, and it appears that prediction has now come to fruition. Both ABC News and NBC News have projected the GOP will keep control of the House of Representatives, effectively ""extinguishing Democrats' hopes of a new progressive era in Washington,"" per Vox. Although there are some races still up in the air, it isn't expected those will have any significant effect in terms of handing control over to the Democrats, who needed to gain 30 seats to flip the current 247-188 majority. That’s not to say the GOP won't suffer losses: Per NBC, the party will lose between five and 20 seats ""due in large part"" to Donald Trump as its nominee. What may now be slipping out of Dems' grasp, thanks to this development: the chance to push through a climate change cap-and-trade bill, immigration reform, or a hike in the minimum wage, Vox reports.

"– In the year before two children were found dead in a California storage locker, social workers visited the home of their guardian at least four times but didn't identify enough of a risk to remove the children. ""We're looking at the case to see if there's anything we should have done differently,"" social services rep Elliott Robinson tells KSBW. Authorities left ""shaken"" by the case say Delylah Tara, 3, and Shaun Tara, 6, died from long-term child abuse in the care of Tami Huntsman, 39, who family members say is the cousin of the kids' biological father; police say she may be the children's aunt, reports KSBW. The kids' father is believed to have granted Huntsman custody while in prison; the children's mother died two years ago. ""If someone is incarcerated they can make independent arrangements for their [kids'] care without any public agency oversight,"" Robinson says. Police say Huntsman lived in Salinas, Calif., but left home with the children and 17-year-old Gonzalo Curiel, who neighbors say is her boyfriend, on Thanksgiving weekend. They traveled to several cities from Nov. 27 to Dec. 11, the day a 9-year-old girl in Huntsman's custody was found locked in an SUV in Quincy. Police tell the Plumas County News the girl was lice-infested; had open sores, a dislocated jaw, and broken bones; and weighed just 40 pounds. Huntsman and Curiel were arrested for child abuse and torture, and Huntsman's own 12-year-old twins were taken into protective custody; it isn't clear in what condition they were found.

Then it appears he hits the cellphone she's holding. The video goes on to show the driver, who hasn't been named, get out of the car, open Ortiz's door, and ask her again to get out of the car. She again asks why, and the recording stops. Ortiz's attorney says Ortiz didn't want to get out of the Uber because it was the middle of the night in a strange neighborhood far from her home, KTLA reports. Ortiz says the driver went on to pull her from the car, punch her in the face, and force her to the ground.

"– As if Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami didn't wreak enough havoc, the country could be facing an additional threat from it: The threat from Mount Fuji, an active volcano, has grown, a study says. The earthquake boosted the pressure under the newly listed World Heritage site, researchers find, per the Guardian. ""Our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting, but it does show that it's in a critical state,"" the scientists note. They reached their conclusions by using Japan's vast trove of geological data following the quake, investigating it for disturbances. The earthquake hurt the Earth's crust most in the area around the volcano. ""We cannot establish a direct relation of cause and effect between quakes and volcanic eruptions, even if statistically the former lead to an increase in the latter,"" a researcher says. What's more, the data can't say ""when an eruption will occur or what size it will be,"" he tells the Daily Mail. ""All we can say is that Mount Fuji is now in a state of pressure, which means it displays a high potential for eruption."" Fuji last erupted in 1707, sending ash as far as Tokyo, more than 60 miles away. That eruption occurred 49 days after an earthquake. (Meanwhile, the Sendai Nuclear Power Station today became Japan's first nuclear plant to pass post-Fukushima safety regulations, reports the AP.)","[""Adopting a novel approach, the scientists carried

volcano, the part between the magma chamber and the surface, is affected', ""The researchers showed for the first time that the regions where the perturbations of the Earth's crust were the greatest

"– Outgoing Democratic National Committee chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz will take the stage to open her party's convention Monday night, and it could be a volatile moment if her morning reception in front of Florida delegates is any guide. Hecklers repeatedly booed and interrupted her speech, angry over the release of emails suggesting that the DNC tried to torpedo the Bernie Sanders campaign, reports the Hill. Wasserman Schultz has announced she'll quit at the end of the convention, but she made clear Monday that she intends to play a role in the campaign. ""You will see me every day between now and Nov. 8 on the campaign trail, and we will lock arms and we will not stand down,"" she said. Some related coverage: ""Interviews with a variety of pro- and anti-Wasserman Schultz Democrats—and there are plenty of both—suggest that the Florida House member's problems were both personal and structural, and that she retains a relatively bright future even if this chapter of her political life left much to be desired."" From the Washington Post. The idea of ousting Wasserman Schultz had been broached last fall, but President Obama didn't want the headache. So reports Politico in a story detailing her strained ties with the White House and Democratic establishment. A post at the Nation makes the case that she was too divisive to remain in the job, even if the email leak hadn't happened.

"– Illinois police on Wednesday confirmed police officer Charles ""Joe"" Gliniewicz orchestrated a ""carefully staged suicide"" after stealing money from the Fox Lake Police Department's Explorer program over seven years. Lake County Major Crimes Task Force commander George Filenko says the probe points to ""criminal activity on the part of at least two other individuals,"" and a source tells NBC Chicago that Gliniewicz's wife, Mel, and son, DJ, are under investigation. Their names surface again in a Sun-Times report, which identifies them, via a source, as the ""Individual 1"" and ""Individual 2,"" respectively, who exchanged revealing texts with Gliniewicz. New Village Administrator Anne Marrin had been pressing Gliniewicz about the Explorer program up until the day before his death, and texts allegedly make reference to her.

Meanwhile, the 100 Club of Chicago, which offers money to the families of officers killed in the line of duty, has for the first time in its history asked for its $15,000 back.

"– Conjoined twins Jesus and Emanuel, born in Brazil on Monday, have two heads with two functioning brains, but just one heart. The condition, dicephalic parapagus, is extremely rare, thought to affect just one in 100,000 pregnancies—and half don’t reach full-term, the BBC reports. Doctors say Jesus and Emanuel, who also have two spinal cords, cannot be separated because they share just one set of organs. Their 25-year-old mother was expecting twins, but didn't have any ultrasounds while pregnant and learned of the condition just minutes before the boys were born, notes the Daily Mail. ""What we know statistically is that the children who undergo surgery and survive are the children who have less organs in common,"" says their doctor, adding that while one head could be removed, both brains are functioning, making such a choice a crushing one. ""What we've got to think about at this moment is to maintain the children in good condition and see how they will develop,” she says. The mother has breastfed both babies, and their appetites are normal, though the AP reports that one of the boys is having respiratory problems and requires ""special care.""","[""'The mother fed both mouths and the baby stayed with her in her room the whole time"", 'And in a tribute to the religious celebrations at Christmas, she has decided to call the pair Emanoel and Jesus', 'The mother and baby were taken by air ambulance yesterday afternoon to a specialist hospital in the state capital, Belem, to carry out further tests', 'The 25-year-old mother, who lives in a rural area of the state, had no ultra-sound scans during her pregnancy and only found out about the abnormality minutes before the baby was born at 1am on Monday morning', ""' Disbelief: The director of the hospital tells the assembled media of the birth of a two-headed baby"", ""He said: 'On the contrary, the baby was received with much happiness by the family"", 'In the U', ""The hospital's director, Claudionor Assis de Vasconcelos, told Brazil's O Povo newspaper that the woman decided to travel to the hospital because she was feeling strong abdominal pains"", 'Obstetrician Neila Dahas of the Santa Casa de Misericodia Hospital in the city of Belem says the twins were born Monday by Cesarean section', 'The birth of such twins is extremely rare in south-west Asia and Africa', 'The caesarean took an hour because the baby was sitting down', 'Calls to the hospital for more details went unanswered', ""She says on the hospital's website that each boy has his own brain and spinal cord, but they share all other organs, including the heart, lungs and liver"", 'The mother was said to have found about the abnormality only minutes before he was born']"
"– It's got a good beat and you can dance to it, but how is its ""processing fluency?"" The term, the Washington Post explains, is at the heart of social scientists' latest quest to explain why some songs catch on as the ""song of the summer""—or the song of any season, really—while others fade away. The concept, laid out by USC researchers in the Journal of Consumer Psychology in April, isn't complicated. In fact, just the opposite: ""Processing fluency"" is explained by the Post thusly: ""Human brains get really jazzed about things that are easy to grasp."" And in the case of hit songs, that translates into repeating simple words over and over and over. “Tempo does not appear to matter,” say the researchers, who pored over Billboard hits going back to 1958. ""While every artist strives to create a catchy hook, they may also consider striving to write a coherent song in which the chorus is repeated frequently while utilizing a limited vocabulary.” Witness current summer hit ""Shut Up and Dance""—the Post counts 12 repetitions of the title. Researcher Joseph Nunes elaborates on the simple but powerful market force: ""If it's easier, it feels better. If it feels better, it tells me I like it more. If I have a positive feeling about something because it’s familiar, then I think I like it more."" They did not, however, come up with a magic number of repetitions. More is basically more, says Nunes.

"– Belgian authorities thought they had caught the ""man in the hat"" seen in surveillance photos at the Brussels airport, with authorities openly denouncing the suspect as a terrorist over the weekend. Now it appears they had the wrong man. Authorities released the suspect on Monday and began a new push to identify the man dressed in white in the surveillance images, reports NBC News. The New York Times is using phrases such as ""enormous blunder"" and ""stunning setback"" to describe the development. Police had charged Faycal Cheffou with terrorism after a cabdriver identified him from a photo as the third man he drove to the airport the morning of the attacks, along with two suicide bombers. ""The evidence that had led to the arrest of the man named Faycal C. was not confirmed by the evolution of the ongoing investigation,"" says a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor. ""Consequently, he has been freed by the investigative judge."" One Belgian official over the weekend described him as an ""extremist jihadi horror,"" even though DNA tests had yet to come back.

"– A new study provides the first evidence that ants rescue members of their own colony post-battle even when those ants aren't in imminent danger, reports the Guardian. The observation came about when biologist Erik Frank was watching army ants march out to battle termites in highly patterned formation—""like three ants next to each other, in a 2-meter-long column,"" he tells NPR—and he noticed some of the ants returned carrying other ants. Those ants, it turns out, weren't dead but injured, missing a leg or two or weighed down by a dead termite whose jaws were clamped onto them. ""This [is] behavior you don’t expect to see in ants; you always imagine an individual ant as having no value for the colony and that they sacrifice themselves for the good of the colony,"" says Frank. What's more, 95% survived, and many returned to battle the very next day. So Frank and colleagues at the University of Würzburg in Germany began to study this behavior more closely, and learned that one difference between soldiers on a battlefield and ants is ""these ants are not doing it out of the goodness of their heart,"" he says, but rather in response to the chemical signals sent off by their injured comrades. Reporting in the journal Science Advances, they note that the behavior does not occur on the way to battle, and not when injured ants are from outside colonies. There's another matter of practicality: They calculate that a colony size is 29% larger when ants carry back their injured than when they don't. Outside researchers agree this is a form of natural selection. ""This is an army,"" one says. ""They're going off to attack the termites. It's a battle. And the more numerous you are, the more successful you are."" (Ants were farmers well before humans.)","['Our model identifies three additional key variables that affect the potential benefit of this rescue behavior: (i) the product of the absolute rate at which

"– President Obama refused to accept any of the Afghanistan war options presented to him in yesterday's 2 1/2 hour strategy meeting, the AP reports, as concerns soar over the leadership of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the ability of a corrupt Afghan government to eventually secure its own country.

"– Hot on the heels of Britain's slide back into recession, now Spain is officially in its second recession in three years, reports the BBC. Spain's National Statistical Institute said the economy shrank 0.3% last quarter, following a 0.3% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2011. As bad as that contraction is, it's actually less than the government forecast of 0.4%, reports Bloomberg. But that's little consolation to Spain's jobless, as unemployment rose yet again, now reaching 24.4%, the highest since 1996. Unemployment for people under 25 years old is a brutal 52%. ""The figures are terrible for everyone, and terrible for the government. Spain is in a crisis of huge proportions,"" said Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo.

"– Trying to beat addiction through a faith-based 12-step program—Alcoholics Anonymous being the best known of the bunch—typically means you can never take a sip of alcohol again. But Gabrielle Glaser writes for the Atlantic that AA was founded 80 years ago, ""when knowledge of the brain was in its infancy."" It and programs like it present an antiquated model of dealing with addiction, she writes, going on to argue that most addiction counselors today aren't qualified to help those most in need, and that there are alternatives. ""Nowhere in the field of medicine is treatment less grounded in modern science,"" she writes, pointing out that despite the 75% success rate claimed for AA members who ""really tried"" in the group's 12-step bible, the ""Big Book,"" there's ""no conclusive data"" the program actually works. (A retired Harvard professor who's studied AA retention rates puts that number closer to 5% to 8%, she notes.) One of the top methods she thinks we should consider for the estimated 18 million people with alcohol-use disorder, especially now that treating it is mandated for insurers under ObamaCare: medication, especially naltrexone, one of the three FDA-approved drugs that's currently available. A couple other nuggets of note: The AA 12-step model is so ingrained that abstinence—not moderation—is recommended for all, and only after a drinker has ""hit bottom."" ""Researchers I've talked with say that's akin to offering antidepressants only to those who have attempted suicide, or prescribing insulin only after a patient has lapsed into a diabetic coma,"" she writes. Regarding the use of drugs to treat alcoholism, Glaser notes a widespread resistance that's still strong. A psychologist she interviewed who used to speak about using naltrexone to curb cravings at medical conferences said ""the reaction was always 'How can you be giving alcoholics drugs?' They'd look at me like I was promoting Valley of the Dolls 2.0."" Read Glaser's complete take, which includes her own experiment with naltrexone, at the Atlantic.","['1 million Americans currently covered in the individual market who currently have some mental

"– It's a parent's worst nightmare—leave your kids alone for a few minutes and suffer their loss for the rest of your life. Such is the tragic tale out of India, where a mother of twin 3-year-old boys says she stepped out of their Delhi home for six minutes to grab laundry detergent and came home to what appeared to be an empty house, reports the Hindustan Times. The truth was even worse. When her husband rushed home from work to help look for twins Nishant and Nakshya (the parents even began scanning CCTV footage taken outside the house in case of a kidnapping), he ultimately found them stuck head-down in their top-loading washing machine, which had filled with enough water to drown them both. They were rushed to the hospital, but they'd been without oxygen for too long. While officers have found no evidence of foul play, an inquiry into the boys' deaths is likely, and their bodies are being autopsied, reports the Indian Express. It appears that the boys, who'd just been undressed for a bath, climbed onto the pile of clothes next to the washing machine, peered inside, and fell head-first into the small space, unable to move or escape.

The 80-year-old Mississippi man has been selling wood on the side of the road since last year, first with his wife, Helen, by his side, then—after Helen's death from lung cancer last month—by himself, the Sun Herald reports. Smith met Helen at the restaurant he'd go to after a day's work building houses; they'd been married for more than 30 years. But Helen's two-year battle with cancer depleted their savings and pushed their Social Security checks to the limit. That left Smith on the side of the road, selling $5 bags of kindling he collected by chopping stumps to pay off Helen's remaining medical bills.

Her post went viral and dozens of new customers started showing up, buying wood and leaving donations. ""It overwhelmed me,"" Smith tells the Sun Herald. Then it got bigger.

To wit: A Saudi scholar has issued a ruling warning against the pilfering of WiFi, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. ""Taking advantage of the WiFi service illegally or without the knowledge of other beneficiaries or providers is not allowed,"" was the stern mandate of Ali Al Hakami, a member of the Islamic religious council that advises the Saudi king. He clarified that public WiFi, such as that found in parks, hotels, and shopping malls, is A-OK to access. Gulf News points out that this most recent ruling aligns with one issued in April by Dubai's Department of Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities after a reader on its website asked if it was OK to tap into a neighbor's WiFi. ""There is nothing wrong in using the line if your neighbors allow you to do so, but if [they] don't allow you, you may not use it,"" the department advised. Not that this is the first odd fatwa to be proclaimed: RT.com notes rulings have also come down from on high prohibiting emoji, women sitting in chairs, and travel to Mars. But some think it's pretty obvious no one should take something from others without asking—and that instead of a fatwa, Saudis should employ a more common-sense tactic: passwords. ""We do not need a religious edict to pinpoint such basic things,"" one online commenter wrote, per the Gulf News. ""Private property should remain private, especially [since] the owner paid money for the services. Nobody should just take advantage."" (The academy that issues the Nobels finally blasted the fatwa against Rushdie—27 years after it was issued.)","['In 1989, the first Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called for the author’s assassination, accusing his novel, The Satanic Verses, of being blasphemous', '“The clear permission of the beneficiary or the provider is a must', 'In other instances, they reflect patriarchal, conservative norms or even outright misogyny: In Indonesia, clerics issued a fatwa against certain emoticons that could be seen as LGBT-friendly; the Islamic State, during the early stages of its insurgency in Syria, declared that women should not be allowed to sit in chairs', 'The WiFi fatwa is far less provocative, although the need for it confused some commentators', '""Taking advantage of the WiFi service illegally or without the knowledge of other beneficiaries or providers is not allowed,"" said Ali Al Hakami, a member of the high scholars\' commission, a senior religious body which advises the Saudi king', 'The WiFi fatwa follows a similar one issued last April by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD) of Dubai in the UAE', 'When the WiFi service is open such as in parks, malls, cafeterias, hotels and government departments, then there is no problem since it is meant to be used by the people or clients', 'The fatwa was made by Ali Al Hakami, a member of the Council of Senior Scholars which advises the Saudi King on religious matters', '“When the Wi-Fi service is open such as in parks, malls, cafeterias, hotels and government departments, then there is no problem since it is meant to be used by the people or clients', 'The WiFi fatwa joins the ranks of some unexpected edicts issued in recent years, including against traveling to Mars, against women eating phallic shaped fruits, women watching football, women sitting on chairs, and emoticons', 'Therefore, the internet should be used only after subscribing for the service,” the government department wrote on its website', '“Taking advantage of the Wi-Fi service illegally or without the knowledge of other beneficiaries or providers is not allowed,” said Ali Al Hakami, a member of the high scholars’ commission, Gulf News reports', 'Sometimes, they can be quite harmless, such as when a religious watchdog in the United Arab Emirates banned travelling to Mars', 'Some Saudis reacted online to the WiFi fatwa by suggesting that it would be more appropriate for people to ensure their WiFi is secure by using a password']"
"– What are the three most horrifying words in the English language? Wrong. The correct answer is ""amateur testicle surgery."" The BBC reports 56-year-old Allan Matthews pleaded guilty Wednesday to removing another man's left testicle at an Australian motel despite not being qualified to practice medicine. The unsanctioned surgery took place in May after a 52-year-old man posted an ad online seeking help for a medical issue, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The man was apparently still suffering after being kicked in the groin by a horse years earlier but couldn't afford an actual doctor. A week after Matthews allegedly removed the man's testicle, infection set in. The man went to the hospital, and the police launched an investigation. Authorities say a raid of Matthews' home last month turned up medical equipment, seven guns, and four bottles of what may be amyl nitrate. In addition to performing surgery without being a doctor, Matthews also pleaded guilty to gun and drug charges. He did not plead guilty to inflicting ""reckless grievous bodily harm.""

"– It's been a rough summer for Yellowstone. First, one of the national park's roads was closed in July because it was melting—now a tourist trying to score some pictures with his drone has accidentally crashed it into one of the area's most famous hot springs, reports Reuters. It's unclear whether Grand Prismatic Spring—the third-largest hot spring in the world, according to the Yellowstone website—was damaged in the accident last Saturday. The tourist was the one who reported the crash, asking a park employee if it would be possible to retrieve it, notes CNN. Visitors have complained of an increase in low-flying drones at Yellowstone, a park spokesman tells Reuters, even though the National Park Service banned ""unmanned aerial vehicles"" in June. A drone slammed into a marina at Yellowstone Lake earlier this summer, and Grand Teton National Park has also been riddled with the remote-controlled robots. Now park officials have to weigh whether it's worth it to dig out this downed drone from the 121-foot-deep Grand Prismatic, possibly marring the hot spring, or just to let the machine rest in peace in the multicolored bacterial waters.

"– On Saturday, the Salt Lake Tribune revealed that before he killed his two young sons and himself, the FBI had caught Josh Powell—husband of Susan Powell, missing since 2009—with child pornography on his computer. Now the lawyer for Susan Powell's parents, Chuck and Judy Cox, responds to the news with what sounds almost like resignation: ""It’s just one thing after another in terms of bad breaks and bad news and bad action by the authorities. It keeps getting worse,"" she tells NBC News. ""There are so many reasons Josh shouldn’t have had those kids."" The FBI uncovered the child pornography at least 17 months before Josh Powell's murder-suicide, according to documents obtained by the Tribune; the documents don't detail what images were found. As such, the FBI had two open investigations into Powell—one related to his wife's disappearance, the other related to the suspected possession of child porn—yet Powell still had visitation rights with Braden, 5, and Charlie, 7, whom he bludgeoned with an ax before blowing up his home on Feb. 5, 2012. The Coxes' lawyer says the couple was never informed about the child porn investigation, nor was sufficient information about that investigation shared with Washington state's social services department; otherwise the agency ""never would have let him have those kids."" During the custody case, the state revealed Powell was being investigated over cartoon images of mother-child incest allegedly found on his computer between 2009 and 2010, but the then-assistant Washington attorney general says the FBI never told him ""if there was something more serious"" than cartoon images found.

"– France is in mourning—and on high alert—after Thursday night's horrific truck attack on a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in the southern city of Nice. The attacker who plowed into hundreds of people, killing at least 84 and injuring dozens of others over more than a mile, has been named by Nice-Matin as local man Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel. Sources tell CNN that the 31-year-old French-Tunisian was a petty criminal who was not on authorities' radar for jihadist activities. He was shot dead by police, apparently after opening fire on the crowd, and authorities found his identity papers inside the vehicle, along with more weapons, the BBC reports. A witness who saw the driver's face says he ""had a beard and appeared to be having fun."" In other developments: France has declared three days of national mourning and extended a state of emergency. ""We are facing a war that terrorism has brought to us. The goal of terrorists is to instill fear and panic,"" Prime Minister Manuel Valls says. ""And France is a great country, and a great democracy that will not allow itself to be destabilized."" Regional lawmaker Eric Ciotti says that one person jumped onto the truck to try to stop it, the AP reports. ""It's at that moment that the police were able to neutralize this terrorist,"" he says. ""I won't forget the look of this policewoman who intercepted the killer."" A spokeswoman for the Lenval Foundation children's hospital in Nice says they have treated at least 50 young victims, including two who died during or after surgery. Others are in a condition that is ""still life and death,"" she says. The attack was condemned by world leaders, including Pope Francis, President Obama, and Angela Merkel, who says, ""I am convinced that, despite all the difficulties, we shall win this fight,"" reports Reuters. European Council chief Donald Tusk says the world stands with France. ""It is a tragic paradox that the victims of the attack [were] people celebrating liberty, equality, and fraternity,"" he says.

"– Nobel week is upon us again, having kicked off Monday with the award for medicine. Scientific American compiled a dozen surprising facts about the history of the prizes, established by the wealthy Swedish industrialist who happened to invent dynamite. Here are six standouts from its list: 860 laureates and 25 organizations have won the Nobel Prize between 1901 and 2014, and four laureates won twice. Linus Pauling, however, stands alone as the only person to win an unshared Nobel twice—first in 1954 in chemistry, and second in 1962 in peace, per the Nobel Foundation. Three winners were in prison when they won. German journalist Carl von Ossietzky, Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi, and Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo all won the peace prize. Only two prizes have been sold during a laureate's life, and both in the past year. One was 1988 physics winner, Leon Lederman, who auctioned his prize for $765,000 to cover medical expenses. The average age of Nobel laureates is 59, with the oldest winner being Leonid Hurwicz, who won in economics in 2007 at the age of 90. The youngest winner, Malala Yousafzai, won the Peace Prize in 2014 at 17. It can take decades to be recognized—two to three on average. But in 1966, Peyton Rous won the medicine prize for work he did 50 years earlier on viruses that can cause tumors. After awarding the prize to two dead people, the Nobel Foundation decided in the 1970s to no longer hand out prizes posthumously. But in 2011, Ralph Steinman won the prize in medicine three days after he died—the judges hadn't known, and decided to let it stand. For the full list, head over to Scientific American.","['The Board of the Nobel Foundation examined the statutes, and an interpretation of the purpose of the rule above led to the conclusion that Ralph Steinman should continue to remain a Nobel Laureate, as the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet had announced the 2011 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine without knowing of his death', '"" Then, in 1972 Bardeen indeed won a second Nobel (making him the third person in the history of the prize to win twice)', 'But the oldest prizewinner was 90-year-old Leonid Hurwicz, who won the Economics Nobel (technically called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economics Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel) in 2007', 'From 1974, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that a Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Nobel Prize', 'In November 1895 Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, setting aside most of his wealth for the establishment of the Nobel Prize after his death', '” The king of Sweden noted the absence at the ceremony and scolded Bardeen', 'On the other end of the spectrum, in 1957 Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee received the Physics prize for work on the parity laws in particle physics—work that had been done in 1956', 'Sometimes the wait is even longer: In 1966 Peyton Rous was awarded the Physiology or Medicine prize for his work on viruses that can cause tumors, a discovery that was based on research done in the early 1910s, a difference of roughly 50 years', 'Over the hill?

"– He sat two rows behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his hearing last Thursday, and hundreds of Facebook employees are reportedly up in arms about the perceived show of support. That's because the man in question is Joel Kaplan, Facebook's Washington, DC-based vice president for global public policy. He's a longtime friend of Kavanaugh's, but the appearance apparently rankled Facebookers, who asked Mark Zuckerberg about Kaplan's choice during his Q&A the next day. The Wall Street Journal reports Zuckerberg said he would have made a different choice, but that no Facebook policies were violated. The New York Times reports Kaplan sent out an internal message Friday that read, ""I want to apologize. I recognize this moment is a deeply painful one—internally and externally."" But in the Journal's telling, employees haven't simmered down about it, and Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are planning to discuss it in a Friday meeting. (As Vice puts it, they'll face ""hundreds of irate employees."") Facebook had this to say in a statement to CNBC: ""Our leadership team recognizes that they've made mistakes handling the events of the last week and we're grateful for all the feedback from our employees.""

"– The details surrounding the shooting of Ibragim Todashev, friend of Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, continue to be tweaked: Though officials said yesterday that Todashev was unarmed when he was shot, today a slightly different version of the story is emerging: The New York Times reports that Todashev first knocked an FBI agent to the ground by tossing a table at him, then ran at him with a metal pole (possibly a broomstick) before being shot and killed. The Times cites a senior law enforcement official, and calls his account of the incident ""the most detailed to date."" Citing a government official, USA Today reports that Todashev overturned the table, pushed the agent into a wall, and came at him with a pole. In this telling, the metal pole was ""about the size of a broom handle."" CBS Boston has basically the same story, citing multiple law enforcement officials. CBS Boston adds the interesting detail that Todashev reportedly flipped the table as the agent looked down to read a text. It was apparently a message from the state trooper who was also in the room; he thought Todashev was growing agitated, and wanted to mention that to the agent without Todashev's knowledge. All three accounts agree that Todashev ran at the agent again after the first few shots were fired, prompting the agent to shoot again, and that the agent required stitches for his injuries. Meanwhile, Todashev's father Abdulbaki publicized pictures (which have not been authenticated) of his son's dead body, said to have been taken by a friend, and accused the FBI of an ""execution-style"" killing, the AP reports. He claims Todashev had six gunshot wounds to his torso and one to the back of his head. He maintains his son was ""100% unarmed,"" and says he was ""tortured."" His theory: ""Maybe my son knew something, some information the police did not want to be made public.

Chris Daly, the 37-year-old representative of the city’s oft-tawdry Tenderloin district, warned colleagues of his intent at a meeting Thursday; needless to say, few were charmed. “I certainly hope that Supervisor Daly’s resolution fails quickly,” the board’s president, who later left a bar of soap on Daly’s desk, tells KCBS-TV. Mayor Gavin Newsom suggests a swear jar, into which Daly should pay a fine for each blast. “Will he ever be president of the United States?

"– A group of California billionaires is joining political insiders to put a $10 billion tax hike measure on the state ballot. Members of the Think Long Committee include billionaire Google chairman Eric Schmidt and philanthropist Eli Broad, as well as former governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Condoleezza Rice. The group's plan is to boost tax revenue for education and to pay down the state's debt by relying on an ""ideological hybrid"" of ideas from both the right and the left, spokesman Nathan Gardels tells the San Francisco Chronicle. The proposal would lower California's personal income tax and sales tax rates, but impose a 5% tax on currently untaxed services such as legal work and accounting. Under the proposal, couples earning up to $45,000 would pay no state income tax; those earning up to $95,000 would pay 2%; and those earning more would pay 7.5%, with a 1% surcharge for Californians earning more than $1 million. The corporate tax rate would be cut from 8.84% to 7%. Committee founder Nicolas Berggruen has said he'll commit $20 million of his own funds to pass the measure, reports the Los Angeles Times.

He's Confused About What Plagiarism Means,"" reads another at Bustle.

"– The UK's National Health Service says desk jockeys should get up and move every 30 minutes to avoid an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular problems, and premature death attributed to too much sitting. A new study, however, suggests that may not be necessary. Why? The risk of early death from sitting for long periods is essentially erased with regular exercise, researchers say, per Mashable. The study ""indicates that the problem lies in the absence of movement rather than the time spent sitting itself,"" a researcher says in a release. ""Any stationary posture where energy expenditure is low may be detrimental to health, be it sitting or standing."" One thing to note: The NHS based its recommendation on a study of almost 800,000 people, whereas this latest study surveyed data from about 5,000 UK civil servants. As the participants used London's public transportation, they spent twice as much time walking as the average Briton. They recorded how much time they spent sitting at work and elsewhere, including in front of the TV, over 16 years, making the study ""one of the longest follow-up studies in this area of research,"" per the release. Researchers found no link between sitting and mortality risk. ""Our findings suggest that reducing sitting time might not be quite as important for mortality risk as previously publicized and that encouraging people to be more active should still be a public health priority,"" the lead author says. The Telegraph notes those sit-stand workstations employers are adopting should perhaps be swapped for treadmill desks to promote regular movement. (This professor thinks he's come up with the perfect sit-stand formula.)","[""The study says more research is needed into the incidence of developing diseases like diabetes from sitting, and also whether it's the physical posture of sitting or just the lack of motion that is harmful"", 'Participants reported the number of ‘measures’ of spirits, ‘glasses’ of wine and ‘pints’ of beer consumed in the previous 7 days, and this was then converted to units (1 unit = 8 g) of alcohol', 'To examine whether the associations between sitting and mortality differed between a priori defined subgroups, interaction terms were fitted for each sitting indicator with gender, age (in 10-year age groups), BMI (in categories according to World Health Organization [WHO] classifications of underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese) 35 and physical activity (according to adherence to the Department of Health guidelines for MVPA)', '""Our study overturns current thinking on the health risks of sitting and indicates that the problem lies in the absence of movement rather than the time spent sitting itself"" said study author Dr Melvyn Hillsdon', 'Another possible explanation is that the absence of any associations between sitting and mortality is attributable to a protective effect of the high volumes of daily walking reported in the Whitehall II cohort', '53,54 Further experimental evidence is also required to isolate the specific biological underpinnings of the previously observed negative effects of sitting, and to clarify which features of sitting (postural topography or energy expenditure) are important', 'If the pattern of sitting rather than the overall duration is the important factor, it again follows that variation in energy expenditure rather than the posture of sitting may determine the relationship between sitting and mortality', 'In order to examine the possibility of bias due to differential loss from the original 1985 cohort, baseline age, gender, employment grade, alcohol consumption and the likelihood of being obese and of being a current smoker were compared between those who did and those who did not respond to questionnaire items relating

University of Exeter concluded that the key aspect in terms of a person's health was their mobility while sitting or standing"", '34 Survival time was measured from the date of measurement at Phase 5

mortality that is distinct from the effect of physical activity', 'This study aims to enhance the evidence base by examining the type-specific prospective associations of four different sitting behaviours as well as total sitting with the risk of all-cause mortality', 'Although the examination of total sitting time remains important, future research should continue to separately consider the individual effects, determinants and confounding factors associated with sitting in different contexts', 'Better definition and measurement of sitting as an exposure will allow a greater understanding of the associations with mortality risk and other health outcomes', 'Improvement in the technology of sedentary behaviour measurement will greatly aid the advancement of this field', 'There were no associations between any of the five sitting indicators at Phase 5 and all-cause mortality risk over the follow-up period in either model 1 or 2', 'The items used in the current analyses also do not permit separate examination of weekday and weekend sitting, which may mask important differential associations', 'The present study tested the hypothesis that sitting time would predict mortality risk independently of MVPA and associations would vary by type of sitting', '“Our findings suggest that reducing sitting time might not be quite as important for mortality risk as previously publicised and that encouraging people to be more active should still be a public health priority,” said lead author Richard Pulsford, a researcher in the sport and health sciences department at the University of Exeter', 'Until more robust epidemiological and mechanistic evidence exists about the risks of prolonged sitting, the promotion of a physically active lifestyle should still be a priority', ""Researchers at the University of Exeter and University College London looked at data from 5,000 participants over 16 years, and found that prolonged periods of sitting doesn't increase the risk of an early death if you are otherwise physically active"", 'The results of the current analysis are inconsistent with previous studies which have shown positive associations between all-cause mortality

"– A home in East Hampton made famous in a 1975 documentary—and again in an Emmy-winning 2009 HBO movie starring Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore, and yet again in a Broadway musical—is for sale for the first time since 1979. That's right, Grey Gardens could be yours for the asking price of $19,995,000, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to Newsday, the three-story home built in 1897 sits on 1.7 acres and has seven bedrooms, 6.5 bathrooms, a swimming pool, a tennis court, and ocean views; it's only 100 yards from the beach. Grey Gardens is being sold by journalist Sally Quinn, who bought it for $220,000 along with her husband Ben Bradlee, the late Washington Post executive editor. The house was made famous by ""Little Edie"" Beale—Jackie O's cousin—who lived there with her mother ""Big Edie."" The pair lived ""in a state of squalor"" as the house fell down around them. A real estate agent says the house has become ""American folklore."" After purchasing Grey Gardens from Beale, Bradlee and Quinn spent about $600,000 repairing it, Atlas Obscura reports. It became their summer house where they would host parties with famous guests, such as Norman Lear and Lauren Bacall. Quinn says it was a ""magical place"" but ""wasn't the same"" without Bradlee, who died in 2014. Quinn and Bradlee had to promise Beale they wouldn't tear the house down, but Quinn is making no such requirement during the current sale.","['The home was originally built in 1897, but by the early 1970s was in derelict shape, crumbling on the outside and flea-infested on the inside', 'Bradlee and Quinn restored the house and spent the month of August at the home most years until Bradlee died in 2014', '995 million, or about 90 times what Quinn and Bradlee originally paid, which reflects both the continued resonance of the Maysles brothers’ documentary as well as the realities of the Long Island real estate market', '“It hasn’t been on the market in almost 40 years, but it’s gotten much more critical acclaim since then,” says Michael Schultz of The Corcoran Group, alluding to the movie and play', 'In October 2016, the home was listed as a yearly rental, excluding the month of August, for $175,000', 'All of the architectural details of the home are intact, Schultz says, including Dutch doors, molding, built-in cabinets and marble sinks', 'Even then, the price was pretty reasonable for the neighborhood (about $730,000 today), but that was mostly because the East Hampton, New York, home, as portrayed in the documentary, was in severe disrepair', 'She and her late husband Ben Bradlee, the longtime executive editor of the Washington Post, restored the then-crumbling house for an estimated $600,000 and used it for years as a summer home, Ms', 'Grey Gardens, the East Hampton home that inspired a documentary, an HBO movie and a Broadway musical, is going on the market for the first time in decades with an asking price of $19', 'Bradlee died in 2014, and the home, she told the Journal, “wasn’t the same without him', 'A condition of the original sale to Quinn and Bradlee was that they could not tear it down, but Quinn told the Journal she would place no such restrictions on any buyer today', 'Grey Gardens, the legendary East Hampton home that once belonged to relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, is on the market for the first time since 1979']"
"– President Trump has authorized the Agriculture Department to launch the second and final round of $11 billion in trade mitigation payments to farmers hard hit by tariffs. In a tweet on Monday, Trump said he is fulfilling a promise to protect farmers against ""unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations."" ""Our economy is stronger than ever–we stand with our Farmers!"" the president said. The Trump administration in July announced it would provide up to $12 billion to offset losses from Trump's trade disputes with China and other countries. The first round of checks went out in September. In total, producers of almonds, corn, cotton, dairy, hogs, sorghum, soybeans, fresh sweet cherries, and wheat will receive roughly $9.5 billion, the AP reports. Soybean farmers will get the largest share. China resumed buying American soybeans last week, although exports to the country are still down an estimated 97% for the year, CNN reports. Roughly $1.2 billion is earmarked for a food purchase and distribution program and $200 million to promote trade.

"– Things got a little crazy in court today when Alec Baldwin testified against the woman accused of stalking him, with Baldwin crying and Genevieve Sabourin screaming at him. The waterworks came on while Baldwin was describing the time Sabourin allegedly came to his house on the day he proposed to his now-wife. (Though the New York Post and TMZ are both doubtful Baldwin was actually crying; the Post notes his eyes seemed dry.) He also denied they were ever romantically involved, as Sabourin claims they were, which is when Sabourin started yelling. Among her outbursts, courtesy of the New York Daily News: ""Wow, you're lying. I can't believe you're doing that!"" ""He's lying, why he do that?"" ""You have a scar!"" She pointed to her hip, apparently indicating she knows about a secret mark on that part of Baldwin's anatomy. ""I gotta prove that I had a sexual relationship. I didn’t do anything wrong. He’s lying! He’s lying!"" ""Are you crazy?"" (This was in response to Baldwin's testimony that she made hundreds of harassing phone calls to him.) ""Why is he crying?"" The judge repeatedly demanded Sabourin pipe down; finally, after he threatened to hold her in contempt, her lawyer forced her to leave the courtroom. The 40-year-old is charged with 23 counts of harassment and one count of stalking; she allegedly emailed and texted Baldwin as well, asking him to help her ""conceive a mini Baldwin."" For his part, Baldwin says a producer friend introduced him to Sabourin in 2002, and he agreed to meet with her and give her career advice as a favor because she was the producer's mistress. Both before and after court, Baldwin also got heated with a Post photographer he recognized outside, at one point telling him, ""I hope you choke to death.""","['She was the mistress of a dear friend

"– Joe Biden and Paul Ryan have wrapped up the sole vice-presidential debate of the campaign, a much more spirited affair than the first Obama-Romney showdown. Unlike that presidential debate, no clear winner is being anointed. Some highlights: Testy early: Ryan goes after Obama's response to the Libya attack in particular and foreign policy in general. Biden breaks in: ""With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey, because not a single thing he said was accurate."" One of the things Ryan said: Obama's Mideast policy is ""making the world more chaotic and us less safe."" Unemployment: Ryan points out that unemployment in Biden's hometown of Scranton is 10%, up from 8.5% since Obama took office. “That’s how things are going all across America,” Ryan said. ""That's not how things are going,"" Biden chimed in. Ryan's line ""might have been one of the most powerful punches he threw all night,"" writes Rosalind S. Helderman at the Washington Post. 47 percent: Obama didn't address the matter at his debate, but Biden did. “These people are my mom and dad,” he said. “They pay more effective tax than Gov. Romney pays with his federal income tax.” The Hill Laugh line: Referring to Romney's 47% remarks, Ryan said that as Biden well knows,""sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way."" (But ""I always say what I mean,"" retorted Biden, who added that Romney's ""soliloquy"" on the 47% was no mere mistake.) Taxes: “There aren’t enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending,” Ryan said of his opponents. Addressing the camera, he said, “Watch out middle class, the tax bill is coming to you.” Biden, on the other hand, said the Ryan-Romney plan is the one that would hit ordinary Americans. “The middle class got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them. They need some help now.” Ryan zings: ""I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't interrupt each other,"" he said in a clear reference to Obama's debate performance. Moderator: Martha Raddatz of ABC is generally earning high praise for how she handled things. Huffington Post Full transcript: NPR has one from the Federal News Service here. A theme emerging: ""At the least, Paul Ryan has been able to get Joe Biden to react tonight. In the first half hour, we've seen the vice president, huff, fold his arms, declare Mr. Ryan is spewing 'malarkey' and that 'this is stuff!' The congressman has not shown the same emotion."" Danny Yadron, Wall Street Journal ""As we pass the midway point, the debate has shaped up as a contest between an extraordinarily aggressive, frequently-interrupting Biden and a more restrained, even subdued Ryan. How that plays at home is anyone’s guess—but it’s a real role reversal from last week’s Obama—Romney forum."" Alexander Burns, Politico ""Biden has been an explosion of reactions all night: laughing, rolling his eyes, grimacing, sighing, furrowing his brow and practically bursting out of his skin to jump at every answer. The question is: How will it play?"" Michael D. Shear, New York Times So how did it play? Probably depends on your party, notes AP.

"– Britney Spears' former manager Sam Lutfi is suing her parents and conservators for millions, claiming he had an agreement to get 15% of her earnings—and of course, since Lutfi was Britney's confidante during her head-shaving phase, the first day of the trial yesterday included some scandalous claims. Lutfi's attorney told the jury that his client was trying to keep an amphetamine-loving Spears from using drugs, but lost control as she spiraled downward and was turned into a ""scapegoat"" and falsely accused, in Spears' mother's book, of drugging the pop star. Some of the crazier details from yesterday's Lutfi camp opening remarks, from the AP and TMZ: When Lutfi was first hired, his lawyer said, he brought in drug-sniffing dogs to Spears' home and they found a substance Spears admitted was likely crystal meth. The reason for that head-shaving incident? Lutfi claims Britney was so paranoid her hair would hold traces of the drugs she was using, she shaved it all off in an effort not to test positive and lose custody of her sons. Lutfi also says Brit OD'ed on amphetamines in 2008, the night she was placed on a psychiatric hold. The trial—which is not expected to include testimony from Brit herself—comes after years of legal wrangling between Lutfi and the Spears clan; the family got a restraining order against him at one point and another legal battle involving legal fees is also pending. When the Spears side makes its opening remarks today, lawyers are expected to argue that Lutfi basically acted as a drug pusher for Britney, TMZ reports.","[""The case is the culmination of years of acrimony between Lutfi and Spears' family and conservators, who successfully obtained a restraining order against him to keep him from contacting the singer or trying to intervene in her life"", 'Lutfi sued in February 2009, roughly a year after Spears was hospitalized and placed under the conservatorship to take control of her health and finances', 'Lutfi is suing for libel based on three chapters in the book that describe him as a ""general"" to the paparazzi and portray him as a man trying to manipulate not only the singer but her mother', 'Attorney Joseph Schleimer told the panel that Sam Lutfi was trying to help the singer but lost control in a series of events that led to her being hospitalized and placed under a court-ordered conservator', 'Schleimer says she took 6 to 8 pills early in the day, and several more later and went off the rails', ""Their point -- how can someone deep into drugs be competent enough to sign any contract, and what's the point of signing a contract if she's too wasted to perform?Lutfi claims Britney was on meth and other drugs and he worked 24/7 to rehab her, to no avail"", 'Many of the claims were included in court filings used to obtain the conservatorship, but Lynne Spears included them in her 2008 book ""Through the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World', 'Lawyers for Britney andwill make the case that Sam was like a sleazy drug pusher and fame whore who fueled Britney with drugs to control her and isolate her from her friends and family', 'Schleimer claimed Lutfi befriended the paparazzi so that they would treat Spears with more respect and that he tried to assemble top talent agents to jumpstart her career', ""Britney Spears' former confidante was made a scapegoat for her mental breakdown despite efforts to keep the singer from using drugs, his attorney told a jury in a case against the pop superstar's parents and conservators"", 'The goal is to fix all broken links on the web', 'Lutfi maintains that he was trying to help her, though her parents say Lutfi cut her phone line, hid her cellphones and used the paparazzi as ""henchmen', ""took a huge amount of amphetamines the night she was strapped to a stretcher and placed on a 5150 hold -- so claims's lawyer in the opening statements of his defamation case"", 'Schleimer claimed Spears favored amphetamines and that the dogs turned up a substance the Grammy winner told Lutfi was probably crystal meth']"
"– When 14-year-old Emmett Till walked into a Mississippi store in August 1955, the black teen had no clue that his entrance would lead to his untimely death. And little did anyone in 2017 anticipate that, decades later, the white woman whose words sealed his fate would partly recant her explosive accusations. Sheila Weller revisits for Vanity Fair the story of the boy who helped launch the civil rights movement, as well as the story of Carolyn Bryant Donham, the shopkeeper's wife who back then alleged Emmett had whistled at her, grabbed her by the waist, and said, ""You needn't be afraid of me, baby. I've [slept] with white women before."" His supposed actions led her then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, JW Milam, to seek Emmett out to torture and murder him—charges for which they were acquitted, but which they admitted to for a paid magazine article a few months later. But Weller talks to Timothy Tyson, whose book The Blood of Emmett Till comes out next week, and Tyson says when he interviewed Donham in 2007, the then-72-year-old admitted she'd made up the worst bits of her story. ""That part's not true,"" she told Tyson of the waist-grabbing and sexual talk Emmett had purportedly engaged in. Donham, who was writing her own memoirs—which won't be released until 2036, per Tyson—had since come out against white supremacy and told Tyson, ""Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him."" Weller says Donham, now 82 and living in seclusion, didn't go so far as to mention to Tyson that she felt guilty. Weller notes her words, and Tyson's book, have given us ""reason to revisit a period in our history when bigotry, blood, and sacrifice became a call to action."" Read the full story at Vanity Fair.

"– A widow is suing two Buffalo-area hospitals and doctors in each after her 46-year-old husband was erroneously declared dead last year—and no one believed her when she insisted he was alive, the Democrat and Chronicle reports. When Michael Cleveland suffered a heart attack on Oct. 10, wife Tammy rushed to the ER at DeGraff Memorial Hospital in Tonawanda, only to be told by Dr. Gregory Perry that he'd been unable to restart her husband's heart, the Washington Post reports. Michael was declared dead at 8:29pm, the Buffalo News notes, and Tammy, her daughter, and stepson went to see his body—and were shocked. ""The doctor told me that it would appear like he was breathing, but he really wasn't,"" Tammy told the Democrat and Chronicle. ""He (tried) to hug me."" Here, the second part of her nightmare began. Perry—who the News notes had been a licensed physician for 15 months—and other medical staff refused to believe Tammy's pleas, telling her any movement she was witnessing was ""because he had life expelling out of his body."" Even a coroner who came for the body told Perry to call when Michael stopped showing signs of life, per a PI who interviewed the coroner. Finally, at 11:10—nearly three hours after he'd been declared dead—Perry gave in and checked Michael out, proclaiming, ""My God, he's got a pulse,"" to which Tammy replied, ""No s---,"" the Post reports. Michael was rushed to Buffalo General Medical Center, where he was declared dead for real the next morning—and where Tammy was told that if he had been treated earlier for a collapsed lung punctured during CPR, he may have lived, per the Democrat and Chronicle. ""Poor Mike,"" Tammy tells the News. ""He's got to hear everybody saying he's dead. Can you imagine?""

"– Before the various land masses that are now Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica went their separate ways some 200 million years ago, they were part of the supercontinent Gondwana. So, too, was a ""lost continent"" scientists say is now hiding beneath the island nation of Mauritius. In a video, Lewis Ashwal of South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand explains the oldest rock on Earth exists in continents, while younger rocks form the ocean basins. Formed with volcanic eruptions in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius is also made up of young rock less than 9 million years old, per a release. But remarkably, scientists have found that rock contains minerals that date back 3 billion years to ""one of the earliest periods in Earth's history,"" per Live Science. These minerals known as zircons prove ""there are much older crustal materials under Mauritius that could only have originated from a continent,"" says Ashwal, whose research is published in Nature. He believes Zircons found on a tiny fragment of Gondwana that separated from Madagascar were covered by lava during the volcanic eruptions that created Mauritius before the lava solidified into the Mauritius we see today, hiding the older materials beneath. This suggests ""a complex splintering [of Gondwana] took place, with fragments of continental crust of variable sizes left adrift within the evolving Indian Ocean basin."" A 2013 study found zircons in Mauritius' sand, but some argued the minerals might have been carried there on the wind or scientists' shoes. This study, however, is literally set in stone.

"– Attorneys who fought for the rights of same-sex couples around the country want taxpayers to know how much their lawmakers cost them by obstinately waging a losing battle against gay marriage, Al Jazeera America reports. In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling this summer, lawyers for the plaintiffs in multiple same-sex marriage cases—who mostly worked pro bono—are using a 1976 law that allows them to collect ""reasonable attorney's fees"" from local governments should they win their case. “Some of the tactics the state used were unnecessarily dragging out the time spent and the cost of the litigation. You have government officials who knew very well where this was headed and nonetheless defended these discriminatory laws,"" one lawyer tells Al Jazeera. “It’s the price governments pay for defending bigotry,"" says another. Seven states have already paid attorneys more than $3.5 million in total, and at least four other states could be on the hook for nearly $5 million in fees, Al Jazeera reports. Texas, which appealed after one of its own judges ruled its same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, is refusing to pay the requested $741,000 in legal fees, according to the Houston Press.

"– Journey guitarist Neal Schon and White House gatecrasher Michaele Salahi aired their wedding on pay-per-view, and in a new lawsuit, Schon says San Francisco charged him ""outrageously high"" permit fees as punishment for the PPV plan. He and his wife, now Michaele Schon, are suing both the city and the county, along with three top Parks and Recreation officials, Courthouse News reports. Schon says the city didn't want the couple's wedding at the ""historic venue"" of the Palace of Fine Arts to be broadcast, and thus boosted the fees: $35,000 in rental fees, a $100,000 ""premium reservation fee,"" and a $50,000 ""park regeneration fee."" Being ""extorted"" caused the couple to suffer ""emotional distress,"" the lawsuit claims. The total is ""more than 200 times the next highest fee ever paid for the use of the Palace of Fine Arts,"" according to the lawsuit. Schon says he was also charged $25,000 for a filming permit, even though Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was only charged $1,200 to film. The lawsuit says the heightened fees are illegal, and notes that the couple was discriminated against for exercising ""their free speech rights."" It also claims those aforementioned rights were violated when the city did not allow them to use a room in the Exploratorium they had named ""Sexy"" to fit the wedding's theme of ""Royal, Sexy, Magic,"" because the defendants ""expressed distaste for the stated theme of the room."" As for why the couple still held their wedding at the venue despite the high fees, the San Francisco Chronicle explains that Schon's lawsuit accuses the city of raising the agreed-upon $58,000 in fees to a total of $240,000 at the last minute.","['Image 11 of 20 Miles Schon performs at the wedding of Michaele Schon and Neal Schon at the Palace of Fine Arts on December 15, 2013 in San Francisco, California', 'Image 5 of 20 SAN FRANCISCO, CA -

"– Oh, the second fridge. Almost one in three households in the Midwest has one; locals know it affectionately as the ""beer and deer"" fridge, reports the Chicago Tribune. Across the rest of the US, the average is closer to one in four households. Some 15% of those second fridges are at least 20 years old, reports the Washington Post in an article titled ""Why it's not okay to have a second refrigerator."" Older refrigerators are considerably less energy efficient, and even more so if they're not packed with food, or if they sit in a utility area where they have to work harder to stay cool in the summers. Indeed, buying a new, energy-efficient refrigerator doesn't do much for the environment if you're moving your old appliance to another part of the house: Those who do so are adding to their carbon footprint, not reducing it. What's more, the old machine can cost $130 a year just to keep plugged in, says an expert.

"– Air India has bad news for crew members it deems ""overweight"": Time for you to find a new job. The airline is planning to cut 125 workers after warning several hundred of them last year that it was time to get in shape, the BBC reports. Those who didn't trim down to the weight requirement are being told to leave, though Air India insists this is about fitness level, not weight per se: ""People who are fitter can respond quicker and more efficiently in case of any untoward situation,"" an Air India official tells the Telegraph. For the record, aviation regulations define normal body mass index as 18-25 for male cabin workers and 18-22 for females. But national union leader Tapan Sen says there's no strict weight requirement in the service rules for cabin workers, and a member of the All India Cabin Crew Association says it's ""ridiculous"" to cut employees this way. ""Any industry insider would vouch that Air India flight attendants are the best, mainly because of their long experience,"" the member says. ""So, this guideline and the management's decision to follow it to the letter is unacceptable.""

"– ""Sacrococcygeal teratoma"" are not the words you want to hear during a pregnancy ultrasound, but that's what Margaret Boemer was confronted with when she went for her 16-week checkup. In an interview shared by Texas Children's Hospital with CNN, the Texas mom, who already had three kids at home, was told during that doctor's visit that her fetus had a rare condition in which a tumor grows out of the base of the tailbone. Although the fetus can sometimes withstand the tumor until after birth, it can compete for blood to the point of killing the fetus, says Dr. Darrell Cass of Texas Children's Fetal Center. Boemer had already had complications, and she didn't want to terminate the pregnancy, as some doctors suggested—so her baby was ""born"" twice instead. Translation: Boemer opted for risky fetal surgery in which the fetus, by then almost 24 weeks, was taken out of her uterus in a five-hour procedure. The fetus was ""hanging out in the air,"" Cass explains, while doctors removed most of the tumor; People notes the fetus was outside of the womb for about 20 minutes. Doctors then returned the fetus back to its corporeal home and stitched everything back up. Per NBC Chicago, blood started flowing normally, and little Lynlee was born healthy via C-section at 36 weeks in June. Doctors removed the tumor remnants when Lynlee was eight days old, and now, at 4 months, she's recuperating at home after a few weeks in the NICU. (Fetal surgery to treat birth defects was the subject of a landmark study.)","['The severity of sacrococcygeal teratoma is directly related to the size of the tumor and the amount of blood flow to the tumor', 'Because of a hyperdynamic cardiovascular state, the mother develops symptoms that are similar to pre-eclampsia and may include vomiting, hypertension, peripheral edema (swelling of the hands and feet), proteinuria (protein in the urine), and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)', 'Immediately, the hospital staff whisked the newborn away to the neonatal intensive care unit for an evaluation, but after this initial checkup, she was deemed healthy and transferred to the nursery', '""And in some instances, the tumor wins and the heart just can\'t keep up and the heart goes into failure and the baby dies,"" said Cass', 'He credits the heart specialist, a key member of the team, for giving the right medication and transfusing the right amount of fluid, allowing the surgeons to continue their work', 'These babies need to be closely followed for the development of excess fluid in the abdomen (ascites), in the chest (pleural effusion), around the heart (pericardial effusion), or under the skin (skin edema)', 'Fetuses with large mostly solid tumors need to be monitored frequently between 18 and 28 weeks of gestation for rapid growth of the tumor and the development of excessive blood flow and heart failure (hydrops)', 'It is the extra blood flowing to the tumor that strains the fetal heart enough to cause heart failure(hydrops)', '“And it was very concerning to the specialist', 'Sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) is an unusual tumor that, in the newborn, is located at the base of the tailbone (coccyx)', 'Still, Cass said, the tumor in this case was so large a ""huge"" incision was needed to get to it, so it ended up that the baby was ""hanging out in the air', 'This is because the fetus’s heart has to pump not only to circulate blood to its body, but also

vessels that feed the tumor', '""They saw something on the scan, and the doctor came in and told us that there was something seriously wrong with our baby and that she had a sacrococcygeal teratoma,""

Lynlee’s heart was becoming compromised and she was starting to experience heart failure', 'Radiofrequency waves are used to destroy the blood vessels and, without blood flow, the tumor does not grow and heart failure (hydrops) is reversed', '""It\'s kind of a miracle you\'re able to open the uterus like that and seal it all back and the whole thing works,"" said Cass', 'The surgical team removed the bulk of the tumor', 'It was a relief to finally see her and to see that she had made it through after the open fetal surgery her heart had time to heal while I was still pregnant with her so she has no heart issues now and is just doing amazing,"" beamed Boemer', 'Long-term consequences include the recurrence of the tumor or difficulty with bowel and/or bladder control as a consequence of the surgical procedure', ""In cases with extreme fetal hydrops, the mother may be at risk for maternal mirror syndrome, which is a condition where the mother's condition mimics that of the sick fetus"",

this case, the mother’s uterus is opened under general anesthesia and the fetus’s SCT is surgically removed', '""At eight days old, she had more surgery, and they were able to remove the rest of the tumor,"" explained Boemer', 'When she was just 8 days old, Lynlee had another surgery to remove the remaining part of the tumor', '""Some of these tumors can be very well-tolerated, so the fetus has

"– The National Rifle Association announced its support Thursday for regulating ""bump stocks,"" devices that can effectively convert semi-automatic rifles into fully automated weapons and that were apparently used in the Las Vegas massacre to lethal effect. It was a surprising shift for the leading gun industry group, which in recent years has resolutely opposed any gun regulations. Immediately afterward the White House, too, said it was open to such a change, the AP reports. The NRA announcement followed comments from leading congressional Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan that Congress should take a look at the devices, which were little-known even to gun enthusiasts prior to Sunday's bloodbath, in which the gunman apparently used the currently legal devices to increase firing speed from his semi-automatic weapons. ""The National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,"" the NRA said in a statement—its first since the Oct. 1 shooting, per ABC News. ""The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.""

"– It's an incendiary protest. More than a month after an Italian museum director first burned art to protest budget cuts, Antonio Manfredi is still regularly incinerating works at his Casoria Contemporary Art Museum. ""This is war for the arts,"" Manfredi explains. ""We want the institutions in Italy and around the world to understand that culture is very important. It's not possible when there is an economic problem in the world that the first that the government destroys is art."" Spending on the arts in Italy amounts to a small fraction of 1% of the nation's GDP—less than a fourth of what is spent in France, Germany, and Italy. Manfredi began his protest with works of art he created, and quickly moved on to others—with the permission of artists who created them. ""When I burn one artwork I feel very, very bad. Because each one piece in this museum is one part of my life, is one part of the life of the artist,"" says Manfredi. ""But we destroy some art to save all art.""

"– Fortunately, a face-off between a rancher's supporters—some armed—and federal officials concluded peacefully in Nevada on Saturday. Had it not, a former Arizona sheriff had a plan: ""We were actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front"" near the feds, Richard Mack told Fox News, via the Blaze. ""If they are going to start shooting, it’s going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers."" Meanwhile, those involved in the showdown—which, the Blaze notes, became a question of states' rights—are reflecting on the event.

"– Right now, Barack Obama’s approval ratings are riding high in the wake of a strongly bipartisan State of the Union address and lovely Arizona speech. But there’s plenty of time for all that to change before the 2012 election, writes GOP operative Mark McKinnon in the Daily Beast: “@#&! Happens when you are at the helm of the free world.” He lists 12 reasons why Obama could lose: Obama’s supporters are “exhausted” and disappointed, much like Velma Hart. Obama is sometimes overexposed; in a 2008 Pew poll, close to half of respondents said they’d heard too much about him. The economy is still in trouble, and Obama's approval rating for his economic policies is still below 50%. The Tea Party still has all the momentum. These voters will show up to vote if the fate of ObamaCare is on the line, and “all politics is turnout.” Republicans will benefit from redistricting—five traditionally red states are gaining seats, while six of 10 states losing them are blue. The wars are still going on, and the number of voters who think we’re losing is at its highest level in three years. Only 37% of independents say they’d re-elect Obama if the election were held today.

"– It had to be the luckiest, and most lifesaving, nosebleed in the world. As KTVT reports, it befell 14-year-old Crystal Enns of Wylie, Texas, in 2013. Her parents took her to the doctor when the bleeding wouldn't stop, which led to the diagnosis of a serious kidney disease called juvenile nephronophthisis. ""This kidney disease doesn't get better,"" one of Crystal's doctors tells ABC News. ""In mid- to late adolescence you either have ... to put her on dialysis or you have to [get her a] kidney transplant."" The family opted for the transplant, and Mom Cristy stepped up first—but screening turned up a spot on her kidney that turned out to be cancer. Then dad Mark volunteered, but, incredibly, his screening turned up kidney cancer as well. Both were caught early enough for effective treatment, something that never would have happened if not for their daughter's illness. ""The idea is that we're going to go in and do something that can be lifesaving for our daughter, only to be told, 'This may have saved your life,' because I would never have been tested otherwise,"" says Mark. And there's good news about Crystal, too: Her aunt turned out to be a perfect match, and after successful surgery in April of this year, the now 17-year-old is headed back to high school with a healthy prognosis. The kicker to all this: It turns out that the original nosebleed had nothing to do with Crystal's kidney disease, reports CBS News.

"– With two nights passed since an explosion leveled a building in the East Village of Manhattan, the chances of finding two missing men alive are getting slimmer by the hour. Families and friends continue to search for Moises Lucon, 26, who worked as a busboy at the Sushi Park restaurant, and Nicholas Figuerora, 23, who had been on a date at the restaurant when the blast occurred. “We have just been walking down the streets, one by one,” Lucon's younger brother, Zacarias, tells the Daily News. “We are just so exhausted and upset. I don’t know what happened to him.” Figuerora's date survived the explosion with injuries that included a broken nose and a punctured lung, her sister tells the newspaper. Of the 22 people injured in the explosion, four remained hospitalized in critical condition, reports the New York Times. Investigators continue to look into whether an upgrade to the restaurant's gas and plumbing caused the explosion, with Mayor Bill de Blasio saying yesterday that “there is a possibility that the gas

"– Koko, the beloved gorilla who captivated many with her ability to communicate through sign language, has died at age 46. The western lowland gorilla died in her sleep Tuesday morning, NPR reports. Born at the San Francisco Zoo on July 4, 1971, Koko was chosen as an infant to work with psychologist Francine ""Penny"" Patterson on a language research project. Her knowledge of sign language offered a window into a gorilla's emotions, such as her affection for her pet kitten and her grief when Robin Williams, whom she once met, died. The Gorilla Foundation, which studied her, announced her passing Thursday, Reuters reports. She died at the foundation's preserve in California's Santa Cruz Mountains, the AP reports. Koko was twice featured on the cover of National Geographic, including one cover image she snapped of herself; had multiple books written about her; and was featured in several documentaries. She was also the subject of much research—in addition to knowing sign language, for example, scientists studied her and found that apes may be closer to speaking than had previously been though. She learned to play the recorder in 2012, showing that she could control her breathing, which until then primates weren't believed able to do. She was said to understand some spoken English as well as signs. She even once took part in an ""interspecies chat"" on the internet. Thousands were mourning her death on the Gorilla Foundation's Facebook page.","[""They believed that Koko's nurturing of the kitten and the skills she gained through playing with dolls would be helpful in Koko's learning how to nurture an offspring"", ""In 2005, three staff at The Gorilla Foundation, where Koko resided, filed lawsuits against the organization, alleging that they were pressured to reveal their nipples to Koko by the organization's executive director, among other violations of labor law"", 'In 1929 the great primatologists Robert and Ada Yerkes wrote: “It is entirely possible that the gorilla, while being distinctly inferior to the chimpanzee in ability to use and fashion implements and to operate mechanisms, is superior to it in certain other modes of behavioral adaptation and may indeed possess a higher order of intelligence than any other existing anthropoid ape', 'I was in tears as I read the story and the gentleness of the gorilla and her precious kitten', '[40][41][42] Other researchers argued that Koko did not understand the meaning behind what she was doing and learned to complete the signs simply because the researchers rewarded her for doing so (indicating that her actions were the product of operant conditioning)', '(For Koko, “bird” and “nut” switch from descriptive to perjorative terms by changing the position in which the sign is made', 'In 1998, Koko took to the Internet in what was billed as the first “interspecies” chat, relaying comments such as “I like drinks” via a human interpreter to tens of thousands of online participants', 'For example, she said that nobody taught Koko the word for ""ring"", but to refer to it, Koko combined the words ""finger"" and ""bracelet"", hence ""finger-bracelet""', 'The

the study of gorillas and for their preservation in circumstances of relative freedom', 'At about the age of 5 Koko discovered the value of the lie to get herself out of a jam', ""The foundation says Koko's capacity for language and empathy opened the minds and hearts of millions"", 'After meeting Koko, Eugene Linden, author of Apes, Men, and Language, commended, “Compared to the sign-language-using chimps, the gorilla is calmer and more deliberate', 'Koko seems to resort to the sign language more often to express herself, and she discusses a wider range of activities', ""[43][44] Another concern that has been raised about Koko's ability to express coherent thoughts through signs is that interpretation of the gorilla's conversation was left to the handler, who may have seen improbable concatenations of signs as meaningful"", '“The Gorilla Foundation is sad to announce the passing of our beloved Koko,” the research center said in a statement, adding she passed away in her sleep', 'Koko was loaned to Patterson under the condition that she would spend at least 4 years with Koko', 'Koko, reflecting her gorilla tastes, picked the apple and the flower', ""Koko's top preferences are corn on the cob and tomatoes; her lowest, spinach and carrots"", 'She points to the stove', 'But by the time I began to publish data on Koko, many early critics of the Gardners had either recanted or softened their criticisms, in part because of the mass of fresh evidence on the language capacities of apes', 'A cardinal characteristic of human language is displacement, the ability to refer to events removed in time and place from the act of communication', 'In 1959 Hilda Knobloch and Benjamin Pasamanick had reported: “There is little question that the chimpanzee is capable of conceptualization and abstraction that is beyond the abilities of the gorilla', 'As with other great-ape language experiments, the extent to which Koko mastered and demonstrated language through the use of these signs is disputed', ""[5] Koko's training began at the age of 1 and she had a working vocabulary of more than 1,000 signs, which she was able to combine in complex ways"",

trapeze"", 'Penny Patterson, who had custody of Koko and who had organized The Gorilla Foundation, wrote that Koko cared for the kitten as if it were a baby gorilla', ""Lest I be alarmed at the thought of an altercation between this slight young woman, who is deaf, and a robust 6-year-old female gorilla, Cathy laughingly pointed to the notebook in which Koko's utterances in sign language are logged"", ""I have exploited Koko's irrational fear of this reptile by placing toy alligators in parts of the trailer I don't want her to touch"", ""” For grapefruit—which she doesn't like—Koko

tableau we presented"", ""The Gardners' breakthrough was to perceive that the chimp's difficulty in acquiring language might not be stupidity, but rather an inability to control lips and tongue"", 'Koko responds to hundreds of spoken words independent of the auditory keyboard, but her vocabulary of spoken English that she can generate (it will surely expand) is now restricted to 46 words', ""Soon after starting work with Koko, I met Carroll Soo-Hoo, the man who had donated Koko's mother to the San Francisco Zoo"", 'Of striking import to me was that Koko knew she could not remember or express whatever it was that had prompted the bite', 'Of course such subjective behavior as lying is difficult to prove empirically, but when Koko uses language to make a point, to joke, to express her displeasure, or to lie her way out of a jam, then she is exploiting language the way we do as human beings', ""As the animal comes to associate the hand movement and its meaning, the teacher gradually loosens his or her hold on the ape's hands until the animal is making the sign by itself"", 'It was reported that Koko understood approximately 2,000 words of spoken English, in addition to the signs', 'Koko\'s weight of 280 pounds (127 kg) was higher than would be normal for a gorilla in the wild, where the average weight is approximately 150–200 pounds (70–90 kg), but the foundation

specific signs, in what is commonly called the Clever Hans effect"", 'Most bite attempts resulted from the method I used to get Koko to make signs—the “molding” technique the Gardners used with Washoe', 'However, by such indicators as range of vocabulary, frequency of utterance, and mean length of utterance, Koko must be considered at least the intellectual peer of the chimp', ""Having

chimp sign language would be to pursue the ultimate question with the ultimate animal', 'Nothing indicates that Koko has reached the limit of her learning capacities', 'On our first meeting, Koko did nothing to advance the cause of gorilla public relations', 'Thus Koko can produce the spoken English for objects, ideas, and actions already banked in her sign vocabulary', 'Certainly, the pioneering work of the Gardners, the Premacks, and Dr', '""[29][31] Even though Koko was 46 years old when she died, well past the average life expectancy of a gorilla, her death took staff members of the Gorilla Foundation by surprise', 'More recently she has begun to use the sign “later” to postpone discussion of possibly unpleasant subjects', ""Koko rises at 8 or 8:30 in the morning, when my

"– If Kellyanne Conway has to go on TV to defend her boss' argument that the Robert Mueller appointment is unconstitutional, she might well be presented with a detailed argument to the contrary from her husband. George Conway, who the Washington Post notes is a respected conservative attorney, has written a 3,500-word piece in the Lawfare blog whose headline pretty much sums things up: ""The Terrible Arguments Against the Constitutionality of the Mueller Investigation."" Conway gives the president a bit of a pass for his June 4 tweet complaining that the Mueller appointment ""is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!”"" Yes, it's a ""meritless legal position,"" writes Conway, but Trump is not a lawyer and thus ""wouldn’t know the difference between a good one and a bad one."" He's less forgiving of attorneys who make that case. ""The ‘constitutional’ arguments made against the special counsel … have little more rigor than the tweet that promoted them,” Conway writes. “Such a lack of rigor, sadly, has been a disturbing trend in much of the politically charged public discourse about the law lately, and one that lawyers—regardless of their politics—owe a duty to abjure."" Conway suspects Trump's opinion is based on an essay by legal scholar Steven Calabresi in the Wall Street Journal, and Conway picks apart Calabresi's rationale that Mueller has exceeded his authority. “Unfortunately for the president,” Conway writes, “these writings are no more correct than the spelling in his original tweet.” (Trump initially spelled ""counsel"" as ""councel."")

"– A judge removed his robe and gave chase after two handcuffed prisoners made a run for it from his Washington state courtroom, the AP reports. Video obtained by the Daily Chronicle shows Judge RW Buzzard leap into action Oct. 16 when the men identified as 22-year-old Tanner Jacobson and 28-year-old Kodey Howard bolt for the door and down a stairwell. Jacobson was in the lead while bounding down four flights of stairs, but the judge closed in on Howard and grabbed him just as he was about to exit the courthouse.

Both prisoners have been charged with second-degree escape. Initial surveillance video shows four prisoners being escorted from court by one deputy, who is out of the frame for most of the footage. Howard and Jacobson are last in line, and rather than walk through an exit to the right of the judge's seat, they pivot and run for the public door at the back of the courtroom. Cameras in the stairwell show that Jacobson sometimes took several steps at a time. Buzzard is seen grabbing Howard and going out of frame just as the prisoner is about to go through an open emergency exit door on the ground floor.

"– The continuing investigation into the crash of an Asiana Airlines plane still hasn't spotted any mechanical trouble—meaning it's likely that pilot mistakes were to blame for the disaster, Sky News reports. National Transportation Safety Board chair Deborah Hersman offered new information about investigators' findings, with concern centered on how pilots could have failed to notice their slow speed during landing, the AP reports. Pilots said they believed the plane's ""autothrottle"" was controlling its speed, but while the device was ""armed,"" it appears to have been set to idle. When the plane's altitude was 500 feet, its airspeed was 134 knots—below the target of 137. A warning sounded; pilots recognized that they weren't aligned with the runway and tried to fix the problem. By the time they'd reached 200 feet, their speed was just 118 knots; pilots are supposed to abort a landing if they're more than 5 knots below target. But they didn't mention speed at all between 500 and 100 feet, Hersman says. ""The first thing that's taught to a pilot is to look at the airspeed indicator. It is the most important instrument in the cockpit,"" says a longtime pilot. ""There are a lot of very experienced airline pilots who are scratching their heads right now."" As for reports of blinding light, the issue doesn't appear to have affected the flight, USA Today reports. Eleven minutes worth of of 911 calls have also been released, revealing the chaos in the immediate aftermath of the crash, Reuters reports. Some of the calls indicate that people near the end of the runway were left unattended as emergency responders initially stuck near the main crash area. Other callers reported not seeing emergency vehicles, but responders say that's because vehicles are not brought too close to the scene in an effort to avoid collisions—or the vehicles being caught in an explosion. Surprised at how much information the NTSB is releasing? It is unusual, the Christian Science Monitor reports, and while some are praising the transparency, others fear it will lead to incorrect conclusions before the investigation is complete.","['Among

The apps mute the sound of a photo click, and can also make it appear that the cell phone user is checking out an innocent email, rather than, say, grabbing an illicit photo up a skirt or around the corner into a dressing room, reports the Daily Mail. ""We can't help but think these apps are designed specifically for taking sneaky photos,"" a police investigator tells the Mercury News. Japanese academics are calling for regulations to prohibit silent snaps as complaints about the photos and invasions of privacy are skyrocketing.

"– Elvis' 1970 White House visit with Nixon has nothing on Kanye West's sit down with President Trump on Thursday. Ostensibly, the meeting was to be about urban revitalization, workforce training, African-American unemployment, clemencies, and Chicago crime, per CNN.

"– A British man who confessed to plotting to kill Donald Trump has been sentenced to a year and a day in federal custody for trying to grab a police officer's gun at a rally in Las Vegas earlier this year. Michael Steven Sandford, a 20-year-old who has been diagnosed with autism, pleaded guilty in September to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and to impeding and disrupting the orderly conduct of government business and official functions, charges that could have sent him to prison for 20 years if the case had gone to trial, the Guardian reports. The BBC reports that Sandford was tearful as he apologized in court for what he had done and for costing the taxpayers money. ""I just feel terrible about it,"" he said. ""You have a medical problem. You should not be ashamed or embarrassed about it. You need medication,"" the judge told Sandford. ""You're not evil or a sociopath like a lot of people we have. I don't think you wanted to kill anybody. This was just some crazy stunt that your mind told you to do."" According to court papers, Sandford was in the US illegally on an expired tourist visa at the time of the June 18 rally. After he was arrested for trying to grab the officer's gun, he told Secret Service agents he had driven there from California to kill Trump.

"– Sitting in a Virginia jail, the suspect in Hannah Graham's disappearance is about to face three new counts—linked to another case dating back nine years, NBC 12 reports. Jesse Matthew, who's been charged with abduction with intent to defile in the Graham case, was indicted by a grand jury today on three counts in a 2005 rape: sexual penetration with an object, abduction, and capital murder. Authorities had already said that forensic evidence indicated Matthew's involvement in a third case, of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, who was last seen hitchhiking outside Charlottesville after a Metallica concert in 2009, CNN reports. Harrington turned up dead on a farm in January 2010. Meanwhile, remains discovered in central Virginia this weekend haven't yet been identified as Graham's. The chief medical examiner's office in Richmond will likely take its time to make sure they get it right, a forensic psychologist tells WTVR. A sheriff's search team found scattered bones, a skull, and a pair of black pants that looked like Graham's, on an abandoned property about 8 miles from where she was last spotted five weeks ago.

"– Anne Coulter’s lips moved quite a bit on Morning Joe today—but you couldn’t hear most of what she was saying. MSNBC censored her discussion of the GOP race, and she appeared confused by the move, Mediaite reports. “What did I say?” she asked on-air after the bleeping. “Oh, I said douche bag.” (She was apparently referring to John McCain, notes Opposing Views.) In the video, all that can be heard is a few clipped phrases about the GOP candidates. “Just blur it all out,” host Joe Scarborough says. “Well, they got the general drift,” responds Coulter, who was defending Mitt Romney on flip-flopping charges. It wasn’t the only notable moment during her appearance. Coulter also called Ted Kennedy “human pestilence”—and Scarborough, who was a friend of Kennedy's, let the comment go. Mike Barnicle didn’t, however. “I don’t know that I’m gonna do that with Ted Kennedy,” he says in the clip. “We miss him in Massachusetts, and I think the country and especially in the Senate.""

"– It's not a we-figured-it-out moment, but it may be a clue. Scientists have discovered that two highly common herpes viruses tend to be present in an ""increased"" way in the brains of people who suffered from Alzheimer's, according to a study published Thursday in Neuron of nearly 1,000 postmortem brains. NPR reports the study also found HHV-6 and HHV-7 may ""put gas on the flame,"" as study author Joel Dudley puts it, meaning the viruses' presence could be speeding up the progress of the disease. Now, the word of caution, from National Institute on Aging director Dr. Richard Hodes: ""The data are very provocative, but fall short of showing a direct causal role. If viral infections are playing a part, they are not the sole actor."" Dudley elaborates on that point, saying the presence of the viruses in the brain doesn't trigger Alzheimer's, but something—which isn't yet known—may be waking up the viruses and causing them to start replicating. The finding does suggest at least one course of action, which Hodes says the institute will be testing: dosing people who have high herpes levels in the brain with antiviral drugs. Live Science notes that ""it may sound startling to learn that there are strains of herpes in the brain,"" but it really isn't. Lead study author Dr. Benjamin Readhead says nearly one of every two brain tissues analyzed had the viruses; it's just that the Alzheimer's brains had up to twice as much.

"– A proud moment for President Trump: Trump, accompanied by Melania Trump, Mike Pence, and Karen Pence, was on hand to welcome three former prisoners back from North Korea at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, the AP reports. Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song, and Kim Sang Duk were released Wednesday after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean officials. The three men arrived at the base at 2:42am on a Boeing C-40 equipped with medical facilities and were taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for evaluation. ""This is a special night for these three really great people,"" Trump said as he stood on the tarmac with them. He thanked Kim Jong Un and said the North Korean leader ""really wants to do something"" about denuclearization. The men ""appear to be in good condition and were all able to walk on the plane without assistance,"" the State Department said in a statement after the release. When the plane stopped to refuel in Alaska, the three men released a statement thanking the US government, Trump, Pompeo, ""and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return,"" adding: ""God bless America, the greatest nation in the world."" All three men had been serving sentences of at least a decade in labor camps, Newsweek reports.

"– New Trump legal team member Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that the president may not sit down with special counsel Robert Mueller and that if he does, he should not be under oath, reports USA Today. ""What they’re really trying to do is trap him into perjury, and we’re not suckers,” the former NYC mayor said Thursday morning on Fox & Friends. The remarks came less than a day after Giuliani’s bombshell interview with Fox host Sean Hannity, in which Giuliani said President Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for “hush money” paid to porn star Stormy Daniels. Giuliani’s statement follows four months of negotiations between the Mueller and Trump teams that have included talk of a subpoena if Trump refuses to testify in the special counsel probe into Russian interference with the 2016 US election. Giuliani also said that any interview with Trump should be limited in time. “They should be able to do this, if they have a case, in two or three hours,” Giuliani said during a series of media interviews Thursday, as reported in the Washington Post. But Giuliani also said, per Fox, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should shut the probe down entirely as it has uncovered no evidence of collusion with the Russians. Trump has said in the past that he would be willing to be interviewed by Mueller, but he lately appears to be walking back some of those statements. Per the Post, some of Trump’s advisers worry that open-ended questions from Mueller could result in ""meandering"" answers from Trump that lead to accusations of perjury. In the Hannity interview Wednesday night, Giuliani said ""the odds are [Trump] wouldn't be interviewed"" by Mueller, but he added, ""I don't close my mind to it.""","['Last month, following the FBI’s raid of Cohen’s personal properties, and the revelation that it was referred by Mueller’s office, a spokesman for the special counsel referred Fox News to the U', ""While most of the coverage of Giuliani's recent television interviews concerned a $130,000 Trump payment to former adult actress Stormy Daniels, the president's attorney also had has new things to say about the Mueller investigation and fired FBI Director James Comey"", '“The basis of the case is dead,” Giuliani said on “Fox & Friends” Thursday, claiming the push to uncover collusion with the Russians has turned up no evidence', ""Giuliani also questioned the need for Trump's testimony, claiming a lack of evidence that Trump had anything to do with Russians who sought to influence the 2016 election with email hacks and fake news"", '“On May 17, 2017, I issued an order entitled ‘Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters,’ appointing you to serve as Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice,” Rosenstein wrote to Mueller in the scope memo', '“If in the course of his or her investigation the Special Counsel concludes that additional jurisdiction beyond that specific in his or her original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters that come to light in the court of his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the additional matters within the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction, or assign them elsewhere,” the code reads', 'Mueller has raised the prospect of a presidential subpoena if Trump refuses to testify, but Giuliani says the special counsel lacks the authority to enforce such a subpoena', 'The attorney also called for an interview to last only two to three hours, saying that was the limit President Bill Clinton had when he testified in the Ken Starr/Monica Lewinsky case', 'On Fox & Friends, Giuliani said the odds of an interview became longer after the FBI raided the home and office of Trump lawyer Michael Cohen', 'When Trump fired Comey last year, he and aides said it was because of the way the former FBI director handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation during the election', 'Attorney and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said in various interviews on Fox News that the president should not be under oath, in part because of concern that prosecutors may try to lay a perjury trap for the president', ""He also blamed Mueller's office for the public revelation of a list of questions it wants to ask of Trump, though there is no evidence the Special Counsel's office leaked the document"", 'Giuliani’s comments come amid pressure from Republicans on Capitol Hill urging the Justice Department to release the full “scope memo,” which outlines the original scope of the investigation when Mueller was named', 'Comey in testimony” before the House Intelligence Committee on March 20, 2017, including “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” and “any matters that arose or may arise directly from that investigation', ""CLOSE The former New York Mayor, who recently joined Trump's legal team, directly contradicted the president's claim that he had no knowledge of Michael Cohen's decision to pay Stormy Daniels $130,000"", '""We’re going to do what is required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job', 'The rest of the scope memo is blacked out', 'On Fox, Giuliani said Trump also fired Comey because he refused to say publicly that Trump was not a target in the Russia investigation', 'Appearing on Wednesday night with Fox host Sean Hannity, Giuliani said that right now ""the odds are he wouldn\'t be interviewed"" by Mueller, but ""I don\'t close my mind to it', 'Giuliani made his latest comments as he discussed in depth the $130,000 payment Trump attorney Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016 to stay silent about accusations of an affair with Trump', 'Rosenstein, meanwhile, warned earlier this week that the Justice Department is ""not going to be extorted"" after members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus drafted articles of impeachment against him']"

"– How did GM mess up so badly in addressing its deadly ignition switch glitch? In part it's due to a snafu over a part number and coworker obstruction, documents released by the House committee investigating the recall reveal. The documents sketch the two-year plight of low-level engineer Brian Stouffer as he tried to get to the bottom of the matter, encountering what he saw as resistance from the electrical engineering division headed by Ray DeGiorgio—who was suspended last week, Bloomberg reports. ""Early in the discussion, we got push back from Electrical regarding their need to be involved,"" Stouffer wrote in a December email. DeGiorgio's unit had quietly fixed the ignition switch in some 2007-model cars, but never changed the part number, leaving Stouffer baffled as to why complaints stopped coming in. In 2012, the company gave Stouffer a list of Cobalt changes that didn't mention it. Management churn hurt, too—Stouffer went through three bosses in one year. GM on Friday recalled yet another 2.19 million vehicles of the same models in response to yet another ignition concern—this time one allowing the key to slip out while the car is on, Autoblog reports. The company said it had ""several hundred"" complaints.","['In June 2012, Stouffer received an e-mail with a report of all of the changes made to the Cobalt steering columns through the 2008 model year, and it didn’t describe changes that would have affected the ignition-lock housing on the steering column or the amount of torque needed to turn the key', 'In the deposition for Cooper, Stouffer said he looked through GM’s database of 500,000 vehicles and was able to find about 100 complaints that seemed to meet the criteria', 'This is a separate problem than the one allowing ignition switches in the same models to inadvertently move from the ""run"" to ""accessory"" positions, which can turn off both the engine and airbag systems', 'The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration first asked GM in 2007 about problems with the switch that was finally recalled eight weeks ago, according to the documents', 'The document trail shows Stouffer was perceiving resistance, or at least a lack of helpfulness, to the probe from the division where DeGiorgio had led the design of the ignition switch', 'Barra, who became chief executive officer in January, said she learned of an analysis about the stalling cars in December and the recall decision on Jan', 'The company will fix the ignition lock cylinders to prevent the problem', '""Before removing the key from the ignition, GM says motorists should ensure their cars are in the ""park"" position or, in manual cars, have the emergency brake on until the cars are repaired', 'Then there was the issue of

Less perilously, the tightness can cause temporary gas and bloating. And in putting what function as ""giant rubber bands around your upper thighs"" then sitting, circulation suffers, and blood clots can form. Shapewear also traps moisture, which can result in yeast or bacterial infections. The experts' advice? Moderation; don't wear it daily.

"– They couldn't have known it at the time, but viewers of a French TV documentary on extremism in 2005 got a close look at one of the two suspects wanted in yesterday's carnage in Paris. Cherif Kouachi, now 32, appears as a ""lanky young man"" who, according to the narrator, was happier to spend time with girls than at the mosque, reports AP. ""He appears relaxed and smiling as he pals around with friends,"" and at one point is shown rapping while wearing a backward baseball cap. About a year after it aired, he was arrested for trying to join fighters in Iraq, though he was depicted during the trial as having fallen in with the wrong crowd. A former lawyer says the 18 months he spent in prison seemed to have hardened him. In 2011, Charif traveled to Yemen and underwent terrorist training with the al-Qaeda affiliate there, reports the New York Times. The training lasted a ""few months"" and covered small-arms combat and marksmanship. Less is known about his brother Said, 34, though both men have been on the US no-fly list for years, reports NBC News. US officials still don't know whether the brothers, who remain at large, acted on their own or received orders from an al-Qaeda leader.

"– The hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness characteristic of menopause may no longer also signal the end of a woman's fertility thanks to a blood treatment used to heal wounds. Presenting their findings at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Helsinki, Finland, this month, researchers in Greece said they were able to reverse menopause in roughly 30 women, including one who entered menopause at 40 but five years later menstruated again, reports New Scientist. The team has collected three eggs from her and, using her husband's sperm, fertilized two into embryos that they plan to implant into her uterus. Still, an outside researcher says, the development ""opens up ethical questions over what the upper age limit of mothers should be."" The team reports that roughly 1% of women become infertile before they turn 40 thanks to certain medical conditions and cancer treatments. ""It offers a window of hope that menopausal women will be able to get pregnant using their own genetic material,"" says gynecologist Konstantinos Sfakianoudis. The team injected a woman's ovaries with a platelet-rich plasma—or PRP, which is made with a person's own blood to trigger tissue and blood vessel growth and has been used by the likes of Tiger Woods to speed healing from soft-tssue injuries, notes Forbes—to effectively rejuvenate them and trigger menstrual cycles.

"– An unusual clash about religious freedom is playing out in the small city of Auburn, Kentucky: It's all about horse diapers, reports the Wall Street Journal. Two local Amish men have filed a lawsuit against the city, its mayor, and its police chief, accusing them of violating their ability to exercise their religion. Back in 2014, the city passed an ordinance requiring that horses on city streets have a ""properly fitting collection device."" The city says it's simply a health and safety issue, reports the Democrat News Leader, and not just about sanitation: The mayor says a child slipped in manure while walking to school. The law isn't targeting anyone ""based on his or her religious views,"" says an attorney for the defendants, a view that the lawsuit disputes. The men who brought the suit belong to the Old Order Swartzentruber Amish, an especially conservative branch that shuns modern contraptions. They carry shovels to clean up manure, and argue that this should be sufficient, while the city's lawyer says stopping to shovel poop poses dangers of its own. Regardless, the Amish say they took a vote and decided to ignore the law, and they say that individual members would be ""shunned"" if they didn't comply with the vote, reports the Daily Beast. Another problem: These Amish aren't allowed to pay fines, which is why one of the plaintiffs spent 10 days in jail in 2015. (See why this Amish teen was pulled over while driving his buggy.)","['The city council first flagged the manure problem in 2007, and Auburn’s mayor asked the Amish to start attaching the diapers to their horses', '“The specific purpose of the Ordinance was to target the Amish so that they could be criminally prosecuted for refusing to use equine diapers,” the lawsuit alleges, noting that only Amish horses came up in discussions of the law', 'According to the lawsuit, the matter was settled by the group’s elders in consultation with members and neighboring Amish communities, and added to their Ordnung, or set of rules', 'I can assume by the verdict that we obviously didn’t clarify to the jurors the violation was for not having a device, instead where the stop was made,” said Hughes', '“[H]e was exposed to offensive language and conduct, and was photographed, all of which is generally frowned upon by the Amish community as a matter of religious principle,” the lawsuit adds', 'The so-called equine diaper is a contraption that wraps around the horse’s body and hind legs, and has a receptacle to catch any manure dropped along the way', 'In the past anonymous persons have paid the Amish fines', 'But the Amish say the law was intended to target them for their religious beliefs and that they clean up just fine without the diapers', 'The ordinance reads: No person should allow an animal under his or her control to be upon public property, including streets within the city limits of Auburn, or upon the property of another, absent the consent of the owner or occupant of the property, without some device for the removal and/or containment of the animals excrement; nor shall any person fail to remove any excrement deposited by any animal under his or her control on public or private property', 'The provision was finally added in 2014, but not before the Amish took a vote to decide that they wouldn’t allow diapers', '“We’ve been trying to handle it locally inside of Auburn for years and not come to writing citations that were enforceable here in the county court system', 'But this lawsuit is just the latest installment in a decade-long drama that began when the Old Order Swartzentruber Amish, a conservative sect, settled in Auburn in the mid-2000s', 'The plaintiffs, Dan Mast and Emanuel Miller, say the ordinance was specifically intended to target members of their religious group', 'The city’s mayor even reportedly claimed that a child slipped in the manure and fell on his way to school', 'The lawsuit alleges that there are 27 other active cases against Amish men for violating the law, and that all the citations were issued by the same police chief', 'Because the Amish don’t use modern technology like cars, they largely travel by horse and buggy or, as the lawsuit states, “are forced to travel on foot', 'A similar lawsuit was filed in Auburn in November, but even that is hard for the Amish to accomplish', 'It is unclear at this time if the three Amish who were most recently cited will pay their $50 fine for the violation or take the citation to court', '“Plaintiffs could not, and cannot, change the Ordnung; they are bound to follow it as a matter of their religious faith,” the lawsuit contends', 'If the plaintiffs were to obey the law by diapering their horses, the lawsuit claims they would be “shunned” by their community', 'The verdict surprised Auburn’s mayor, who was disappointed in the verdict', 'The sole exception of this requirement shall be for special events when cleanup crews are provided as part of the event', '“The Swartzentruber Amish, including Plaintiffs, carry shovels with them to provide an effective means of waste removal without having to affix and equine diaper to their horses', 'The council considered amending the existing dog-waste ordinance to include horse manure—which they suggested was a “health issue” rather than being purely aesthetic', 'Auburn isn’t the only city to have such a problem: Lawmakers in Selma, Alabama, passed a similar ordinance in 2013, but it is widely ignored']"

A resident in the Spanish city of Huesca called police around 4:30am Tuesday to report a herd of sheep making its way through the city streets, per the Telegraph. And what a herd it was. About five officers spent 45 minutes rounding up the animals before delivering them to their shepherd, who was fast asleep, reports Mashable.

"– Rather than wiping out our memories, new research out of Columbia University suggests that dementia instead confuses the brain about which neurons store which memories, thereby making those memories harder to recall. In other words, the memories might remain—however deeply hidden—in the brain, and thus accessing them is just a matter of stimulating the right neurons. ""It has the potential to lead to novel drug development to help with regaining memories,"" a researcher tells the Washington Post. To study this, researchers used a laser technology called optogenetics to watch neuron activity in the brains of mice. All mice in this study were given an electric shock after sniffing a lemon scent, but a week later, only half those with dementia froze when they smelled lemon in anticipation of being shocked, compared to all the healthy mice freezing. The researchers were able to watch the healthy mice retrieve memories from the same place where they'd been stored, while mice with dementia called up other memories stored elsewhere. But by stimulating the neurons with a blue laser, scientists were able to reactivate memories in the mice with dementia. The downside? Optogenetics isn't ready for humans, notes the Post, ""because it isn’t yet safe or practical to tinker with our neurons or stick lasers into our brains."" Next up, scientists hope to see whether memories are stored and retrieved similarly in humans. The Independent points out that in some Alzheimer's cases, music has been known to rouse old memories, ""suggesting they may not disappear completely.""

"– United Airlines got embroiled in a social media controversy about leggings over the weekend. On Sunday, a gate agent in Denver refused to allow three girls to board a flight to Minneapolis because their leggings were deemed inappropriate, reports the New York Times. One of the three was able to board because her mom gave her a dress, but the other two, believed to be young teenagers, had to change and catch the next flight. The incident came to light when another passenger at the airport, Shannon Watts, tweeted about what was happening. After those tweets generated lots of anger online, United said that the girls were ""pass riders,"" referring to relatives of United employees who fly for free on standby, and that dress code is stricter for such passengers. ""The passengers this morning were United pass riders who were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel,"" it tweeted, per Fox 31 Denver. The explanation, however, did little to mollify the online ridicule and scorn being directed United's way. For example, author Dana Schwartz tweeted to women on Twitter to share stories of when they'd felt ""embarrassed"" or ""sexualized"" because of their outfits, and the responses came rolling in, reports Mashable. Actress Patricia Arquette also got involved, with a series of back-and-forth tweets with the airline. ""Do U understand U have just made at least half UR customers very unhappy?"" she wrote.

"– By now, we're used to seeing images of California wildfires destroying homes. But cars on the freeway? That was the case in San Bernardino County today as fast-moving fire swept across Freeway 15, reports KTLA. The fire destroyed 20 cars that had been abandoned on the road and damaged another 10. Drivers had time to escape, and no injuries have been reported. The Los Angeles Times puts it this way: ""In a region where brush fires are a way of life, the scene on the main route to Las Vegas was surreal."" TV news helicopters flew overhead as the abandoned vehicles, including two big rigs, burned. ""I've never seen anything like this before,"" says California Highway Patrol Officer Steve Carapia.

"– As if online dating weren't fraught with enough pitfalls, an IBM study published yesterday found that 26 of 41 popular Android dating apps, or 63%, had ""medium to severe"" security vulnerabilities that could leave users open to hacks, Reuters reports. And almost half of the companies reviewed for the report had workers who tapped into such apps—and then used the same phone at work, opening up their employers to cyberissues as well. ""Your contacts list … your stored images. [Hackers] can actually also potentially access features on the device—so your camera, your microphone, even your GPS location,"" says the security intelligence director of IBM Security, per CBS New York. How likely (and incredibly creepy) is that? The report reveals 73% of top dating apps can tell your past and present GPS locations, while 34% can get into your camera. Which means, on a not-so-romantic front, that hackers can possibly stalk your daily activity, scroll through images, and even take over your dating profile, IBM's Security Intelligence notes. And if the electronic intruders can hijack your camera and mic, they can potentially spy on business meetings and access sensitive company data on your phone. IBM says it doesn't want to discourage people from using the apps, but it preaches some common-sense tips: Don't give out too much personal info on dating sites, don't ignore the security updates and patches your phone occasionally asks you to make, and mix up your passwords for all online accounts and email addresses.

"– From Miami to Detroit to San Antonio, an annual household income of $117,400 puts you firmly in the ""high income"" group. You'd even land in the upper middle class in New York City, per Business Insider. Not so in San Francisco. Further cementing the city's reputation as the most expensive in the country, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has revamped income limits so that a family of four earning $117,400 a year now qualifies as ""low income"" in San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin counties, while a household income of $73,300 is considered ""very low income,"" reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Not only is the low-income gauge the highest such limit in the country, but it represents a 10% increase over last year, per the San Jose Mercury News. As the income limits determine who can qualify for affordable housing programs, the increases mean more people are eligible. ""But they're unlikely to make much difference in a region already suffering from a shortage of affordable housing,"" the Mercury News reports, noting the median house price in some parts of the Bay Area has jumped 25% in the past year.

"– There's a reason shares of CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid were tumbling Thursday, and it can be summed up in one word: Amazon. The retailing behemoth made its first significant move into the pharmacy business by buying PillPack, an online company that ships medications to customers' homes, reports the Wall Street Journal. It's not clear yet what Amazon plans to do with the new business, including whether it will allow the firm to remain independent (as with shoe retailer Zappos) or turn it into the foundation of a bigger health-care push, reports CNNMoney.

""The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages,"" says Stefano Pessina.

"– At least one person is dead and a heavily armed suspect is on the loose after a shooting near a California polling location, the Los Angeles Times reports. Authorities say a man with a rifle opened fire on on people in a residential neighborhood. According to CBS Los Angeles, police officers ""were met with gunfire"" and ""pinned down"" when they arrived on the scene Tuesday afternoon in Azusa. At least three other people were injured, and at least one of the victims was on their way to vote. A voter at a nearby polling place tells CNN he heard shots fired and then a bunch of people ran into the polling place before police locked it down. ""At first, I thought it was construction, but people came running into the room saying they see a guy with a bulletproof vest,"" another voter says. A second polling place and a middle school were also locked down. A Los Angeles County official says ""voters should avoid the area and, if necessary, cast a ballot at an alternate polling location,"" KTLA reports. Residents are being told to shelter in place. Multiple police and SWAT vehicles were on the scene, and three civilian vehicles were crashed near the scene of the shooting. It's unclear if the crash was related.

"– In a new twist in the ongoing saga of a 17-year-old's attempts to get an abortion while being held in a federal immigration shelter, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday the Trump administration must stop blocking her from the procedure, Politico reports. A three-judge panel of the court on Friday gave the government until Oct. 31 to find a sponsor to take custody of the undocumented teen, known only as Jane Doe. Lawyers for the teen, who is being represented by the ACLU, said they'd tried everything to find her a sponsor to no avail. On Sunday, they asked the full court to reverse the panel's decision. Lawyers argued the delay to Oct. 31 is putting the teen dangerously close to the abortion cutoff for Texas, which bans the procedure after 20 weeks. Tuesday's 6-3 ruling was split between Democrat- and Republican-appointed judges. It sends the case back to a lower court, where a judge ordered the Trump administration to allow Jane Doe to have an abortion, the Austin-American Statesman reports. According to the AP, the teen came to the US in September from an unnamed Central American country and found out she was pregnant while in federal custody. The Department of Health and Human Services says it has a police of ""refusing to facilitate"" abortions and had refused to transport or temporarily release the teen to have the procedure. “It’s clear that their anti-woman, anti-abortion, anti-immigration agenda is unchecked by basic decency or even the bounds of the law,” an ACLU lawyer says. The Trump administration could appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.","['“The majority’s decision represents a radical extension of the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence,” Kavanaugh wrote, arguing that the delay to find a sponsor to take custody of Doe represented the best way to resolve the controversy', 'The most reliable politics newsletter', 'Lawyers for the Central American teen,

"– Atlanta educators convicted in a huge cheating scandal got a quick taste of justice today—the judge sent 10 of them straight to jail after the guilty verdicts were announced, allowing one woman to remain free until sentencing only because she is about to give birth, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. All face serious jail time of 20 years or more, thanks to their convictions on racketeering charges. The 11 teachers and administrators were found guilty of changing student answers on standardized tests in order to boost scores, which in turn helped them secure bonuses and raises. (WGCL has a complete list of the educators and their convictions.) ""They are convicted felons as far as I'm concerned,"" said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter. ""They have made their bed and they're going to have to lie in it."" A defense attorney for former school principal Dana Evans said it was ""unnecessary and vindictive"" for the judge to have the educators taken into custody immediately, reports AP. Prosecutors say former superintendent Beverly Hall was behind the coordinated cheating, but the once-honored school official did not go on trial because she was battling breast cancer. She died last month. About two dozen other teachers also were implicated, but they struck plea bargains instead of going to trial. One teacher was exonerated today.","['The 11 convicted represented teachers, testing coordinators and other administrators who were accused of participating in the conspiracy dating to 2005, motivated by pressure to meet federal and local standards to receive bonuses or keep their jobs in the Atlanta Public Schools district of about 50,000 students', 'The district remains dedicated to always putting the needs of our students first', 'The men were taken to the jail in northwest Atlanta, while the women were taken to the South Jail Annex for women in Union City', ""She was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates, particularly among the district's poor and minority students"", '“The APS cheating scandal marked one of the darkest periods in the life of our city', 'Last fall, the district established a new vision of a high-performing school district where students love to learn, educators inspire, families engage and the community trusts the system', 'I am confident that aggressive, swift action will be taken against anyone who believed so little in our students and in our system of support that they turned to dishonesty as the only option', 'Carstarphen and the school board continue to work together to create a new culture at APS, that is a caring one of trust and collaboration where every student graduates ready for college and career', 'Carstarphen, and the new leadership in the Atlanta Board of Education', ""But the educators said she was among those pressuring them to inflate students' scores to show gains in achievement — which were needed to meet federal benchmarks tied to extra funding"", '""It\'s become increasingly clear that a segment of our staff chose to violate the trust that was placed in them,"" Hall said', 'The test, which was issued to students in the APS system, measured student aptitude statewide', '""They have made their bed, and they\'re going to have to lie in it,"" Judge Jerry Baxter said as he sent most of the educators directly to jail', 'The cheating came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that some scores were statistically improbable', 'The entire process was lengthy: The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February', 'Listed below are the 12 educators that went to trial and what charges they were found guilty, or not guilty of:', '"" Guilty verdicts were reached for 11 of the 12 defendants in the Atlanta Public Schools CRCT cheating trial', 'I want to thank Judge Baxter and the Court for their service', '""Our entire effort in this case was simply to get our community to stop and take a look at the education system,"" Howard said', 'Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of the children they were charged with teaching', 'It was our attempt to encourage the people in our community to stop and take an honest look at what was happening in our schools and how changing test scores was ultimately harming our children,” says Howard', 'Bob Rubin, the defense attorney for former elementary school principal Dana Evans, said he was angry the judge decided to take the convicted former educators into custody immediately', 'Robinson was the only educator found guilty who was not immediately taken to jail due to her pregnancy', ""I am hopeful that with the jury's verdict today, we can finally close this chapter and move forward with the education and development of our young people"", '“When we indicted this case our goal was not to make a spectacle of the Atlanta Public School system', 'Ten of the 11 educators found guilty were booked into the Fulton County jail', 'In a video message to schools staff before she retired, Hall warned that the state investigation launched by former Gov', 'But the award quickly lost its luster as her district became mired in the scandal', 'Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation']"
"– When elderly people seem slow or forgetful, it's not because their brains are weaker, but because they have so much knowledge stored up, according to new research. A team using computer models found that measures used to test cognitive decline are flawed and that the wealth of information to process causes things to slow down as the mind's database grows, reports Science Daily. ""The human brain works slower in old age,"" the lead researcher says, ""but only because we have stored more information over time."" ""Imagine someone who knows two people’s birthdays and can recall them almost perfectly,"" the lead researcher tells the Telegraph.

"– Al-Qaeda may still view itself as America's No. 1 enemy, but the Pentagon has a different, ego-deflating assessment. The way things are going, the terror group soon won't qualify as an official adversary of the military, the Pentagon's top lawyer said in a speech at London's Oxford University last night, reports the Guardian. Two key points by Jeh Johnson, who, incidentally, is thought to be a top contender for attorney general when Eric Holder steps down in about a year: ""I do believe that on the present course there will come a tipping point, a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al-Qaeda and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no longer able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the United States, such that al-Qaeda as we know it, the organization that our Congress authorized the military to pursue in 2001, has been effectively destroyed."" ""At that point we must be able to say to ourselves that our efforts should no longer be considered an armed conflict against al-Qaeda and its associated forces, rather a counter-terrorism effort against individuals who are the scattered remains of al-Qaeda … for which the law enforcement and intelligence resources of our government are principally responsible."" The military would play a more limited role, stepping in when necessary. The speech is part of the administration's long-range efforts to clarify its counterterror rules, explains the Wall Street Journal, which susses out a tangible possibility: Remaining detainees at Gitmo are held under the 2001 Authority for the Use of Military Force against al-Qaeda. If that decree is no longer in effect a few years down the road, it presents an avenue for the release of prisoners and closure of the detention facility.","['""I do believe that on the present course there will come a tipping point, a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al-Qaida and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no longer able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the United States, such that al-Qaida as we know it, the organisation that our Congress authorised the military to pursue in 2001, has been effectively destroyed', 'Congress had authorised the president to use ""all necessary and appropriate force"" against the nations, organisations and individuals responsible for the 9/11 attacks; the US supreme court had endorsed this in 2006 by ruling ""our efforts against al-Qaida may be properly viewed as armed conflict""', 'is no longer at war with al Qaeda and that taking on the remnants of the terrorist group would be a matter for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, not the military', 'He said that after the end of the second world war, the US and British governments delayed the release of some Nazi prisoners of war', 'Instead, the responsibility for tackling al-Qaida should pass to the police and other law enforcement agencies', 'In a speech presented tonight in the UK, Johnson was expected to set out the legal principles underpinning the conflict against al-Qaida and insisted they were rooted in domestic and international law', 'Jeh Johnson suggested the group would become so degraded that a time would come when the legal authority given to the White House by Congress should no longer be used to justify waging the war that has been fought since 2001', ""The comments by Jeh Johnson, the Pentagon's general counsel, come as the Obama administration has begun an effort to clarify the rules and constraints on its counterterrorism operations, including such things as drone attacks"", '""At that point we must be able to say to ourselves that our efforts should no longer be considered an armed conflict against al-Qaida and its associated forces, rather a counter-terrorism effort against individuals who are the scattered remains of al-Qaida … for which the law enforcement and intelligence resources of our government are principally responsible', 'Johnson has been general counsel at the US defence department for the past four years and has given advice on every military operation that needs the approval of the president or defence secretary', 'The US could not ""capture or kill every last terrorist who claims an affiliation with al-Qaida"" and the enemy ""did not include anyone solely in the category of activist, journalist, or propagandist""', 'She has been pilloried by Republicans for suggesting the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that led to the death of US ambassador Christopher Stephen was spontaneous rather than planned', 'Speaking at the Oxford Union, Johnson insisted the US was applying conventional law to an unconventional enemy, and justified detaining prisoners indefinitely and using ""targeted lethal force"" – such as drones – to kill suspects']"
"– Only three states have a lifetime voting ban for all felons who can't get a gubernatorial exemption, and now that number's been knocked down to two. As one of his last moves in office, outgoing Kentucky Gov. Steven Beshear signed an executive order Tuesday that grants voting rights to nonviolent felons who've finished their sentences, the New York Times reports. ""Once an individual has served his or her time and paid all restitution, society expects them to reintegrate into their communities and become law-abiding and productive citizens,"" the Democrat said at a news conference. ""A key part of that transition is the right to vote."" The Brennan Center estimates the number of immediately eligible felons at 140,000 (the Sentencing Project puts that figure closer to 100,000), with another 30,000 to come. Still not permitted to vote: felons with new pending charges, as well as those with sex crimes, violent crimes, bribery, or treason to their names. One of the main reasons for the drive to restore felon voting rights is to address the racial disparity present in such a ban. The Sentencing Project estimates one in 13 black men nationwide can't vote because of their felon status, the highest rate of any demographic, per the Times. The paper notes that Gov.-elect Matt Bevin has the legal right to swoop in and change or dump the executive order, but one of his reps tells the paper that Bevin ""has said many times that the restoration of voting rights for certain offenders is the right thing to do"" and that he'll check out the order over the next few weeks to make his final assessment.","['We hope the state will build

"– California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency after a magnitude 6.1 earthquake rolled through the San Francisco area early today, reports the LA Times, in the biggest temblor to hit the region since 1989.

""It felt like I was on a boat in the bay."" At least 120 people have been sent to the hospital; three of them are in critical condition. Thousands are without power, 15 to 16 buildings are ""no longer inhabitable,"" and firefighters are trying to put out six fires amid 50 reported gas leaks and 60 ruptured water mains, the AP reports. The California Highway Patrol's Golden Gate division tweeted that it's checking bridges and other structures for ""obvious signs of structural integrity;"" it later said that preliminary reports ""are looking positive,"" while noting widespread power outages. The quake struck at 3:20 local time, with an epicenter three miles northwest of American Canyon in Napa. It was relatively shallow, with a depth of 6.7 miles; a series of aftershocks have since rattled the area. An early-warning system gave residents a 10-second warning that the quake was coming, the LA Times reports.","['Firemen said the extent of the damage would likely not be known until Monday, as many of

"– New York University researchers lost thousands of lab mice and years of scientific research when Hurricane Sandy hit New York University Hospital. The mice—which had been genetically modified for cancer research and took years to produce—drowned when the hospital flooded, the New York Daily News reports. Many special reagents, like enzymes, antibodies, and DNA strands were likely lost as well when the building lost power; they had been stored at between -80 and -20 degrees. ""This does not equate to a loss of life, but it is extremely disheartening to see years of research go down the drain,"" one source said. That wasn't the storm's only collateral damage either.

But the FBI is showing her photo to marathon witnesses in an effort to determine if she was at the scene, the Post source says. ""When this allegedly was going on, she was working, and had been working all week to support her family,"" says DeLuca. He explained she's a home health-care aide who puts in 70-plus-hour weeks; Tamerlan watched their young daughter while she did so, and ""he was home"" when his wife left for work on the day he was last seen alive.

"– It was fun, or at least weird, while it lasted, but urban legends website Snopes is calling Jasmine Tridevil's story about adding a third breast a hoax. And while Tridevil, aka Alisha Hessler, isn't 'fessing up, Florida's WTSP has dug up an especially telling stolen-item report involving Hessler earlier this month at Tampa International Airport. After her bag was stolen and then recovered, airport police listed its contents as including a ""3 breast prosthesis."" Hessler might be acknowledging the ruse at least subtly. She's a massage therapist, and Snopes has found her website for ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" that refers to her as a ""provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and a ""specialist in massage for three breasted women."" In an interview with the British tabloid the Sun posted today, Hessler was still sticking by her story. ""This is not a fake,"" she says. ""I had the procedure done.

It speaks to one plastic surgeon who says this would have been a lengthy, hugely complicated procedure. So unless some actual third-party proof emerges, and perhaps the identity of the alleged plastic surgeon, she gets the site's ""False"" label.

"– Scores of Republican lawmakers in Florida are calling for a suspension of the sheriff who oversaw the response to the Parkland school shooter. Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran and 73 other Republicans, most of the caucus, have signed a letter accusing Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, a Democrat, of ""incompetence and neglect of duty"" in the months before the shooting, when police received multiple warnings about alleged gunman Nikolas Cruz, the Washington Post reports. ""Sheriff Israel failed to maintain a culture of alertness, vigilance, and thoroughness amongst his deputies,"" the letter states. ""As a result of Sheriff Israel’s failures, students and teachers died."" Florida Gov. Rick Scott says he has called for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the response for the shooting but will not be suspending Israel at this time, the Sun Sentinel reports. Scott says he has spoken to Corcoran and ""like me, he wants the families to have answers and for there to be full accountability."" In a CNN interview Sunday, Israel said he had provided ""amazing leadership"" and it wasn't his fault that deputy Scot Peterson had failed to enter Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during the shooting. Politico reports that the sheriff's office's active shooter protocol does not require a deputy to engage the shooter.

"– Maybe if they had just called it Ishmael, none of this would have happened. A British Columbia company has filed a lawsuit against a building council that refuses to let it lease a unit it owns to a Moby Dick Restaurant fish-and-chips franchise in part because the second word in the eatery's name was deemed ""offensive,"" Courthouse News reports. The plaintiff, Mengfa International, has owned the unit since 2010, and it had initially leased the space to an Asian-fusion restaurant. But after that restaurant started having money troubles, Moby Dick Restaurant came onto the scene in May and agreed to a lease-and-purchase arrangement that would seemingly solve everyone's problems. However, that arrangement was rejected by the building in July. It said the ""word ‘Dick’ in Moby Dick was an offensive term,” per the lawsuit. The building council alleges that signs and other markers with the name and logo would sully the brands of other properties in the building and lower property values. The council also worried about litter and restaurant odors. The lawsuit, however, scoffs at claims that the name would somehow cause nearby property values to plummet, noting that it's a seafood restaurant in a waterfront community—right up the name's alley. Mengfa adds it would do its part to keep litter under control and points out it would be using the same kitchen ventilation system as the previous restaurant. As for the name fracas overall: ""Moby Dick"" is ""not offensive to the public, given its literary significance and fame,"" the suit says. The building council has not filed its defense statement, notes the CBC.

"– A video distributed by the Trump administration to support its argument for banning CNN reporter Jim Acosta from the White House appears to have been doctored to make Acosta look more aggressive than he was during an exchange with a White House intern, an independent expert said Thursday. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted the video, per the AP, which shows Acosta asking President Donald Trump a question on Wednesday as the intern tries to take his microphone away. But a frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident shows that the one tweeted by Sanders appears to have been altered to speed up Acosta's arm movement as he touches the intern's arm, according to Abba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the footage at AP's request. Earlier, Shapiro noticed that frames in the tweeted video were frozen to slow down the action, allowing it to run the same length as the AP one. The alteration is ""too precise to be an accident,"" said Shapiro. The tweeted video also does not have any audio, which Shapiro said would make it easier to alter. Sanders, who hasn't said where the tweeted video came from, noted that it clearly shows Acosta made contact with the intern. CNN has labeled Sanders' characterization of Acosta's exchange with the intern as a lie. Its position has been supported by witnesses including Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who was next to Acosta during the news. ""The irony of this … is that if it is found to be doctored, it will show the administration to be doing what it accuses the news media of doing—engaging in fake information,"" said Aly Colon, a professor in journalism ethics.","['Earlier, Shapiro noticed that frames in the tweeted video were frozen to slow down the action, allowing it to run the same length as the AP one', '"" And Acosta has been one of the more visible thorns in the side of the White House', ""But a frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident shows that the one tweeted by Sanders appears to have been altered to speed up Acosta's arm movement as he touches the intern's arm, according to Abba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the footage at AP's request"", '""The irony of this White House video involving Jim Acosta is that if it is found to be doctored, it will show the administration to be doing what it accuses the news media of doing — engaging in fake information,"" said Aly Colon, a professor in journalism ethics at Washington & Lee University', 'The White House News Photographers Association decried the sharing of the footage', '""It is the essential function of a free press in every democracy to independently gather and report information in the public interest, a right that is enshrined in the First Amendment,"" said Julie Pace, AP\'s Washington bureau chief', 'NEW YORK (AP) — A video distributed by the Trump administration to support its argument for banning CNN reporter Jim Acosta from the White House appears to have been doctored to make Acosta look more aggressive than he was during an exchange with a White House intern, an independent expert said Thursday', ""Still, it's rare for the White House to pull the so-called hard passes from journalists"", 'In the 1970s, President Nixon tried to get Washington Post reporters banned from the White House', 'Its position has been supported by witnesses including Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who was next to Acosta during the news conference and tweeted that he did not see Acosta place his hands on the White House employee', 'White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted the video, which shows Acosta asking President Donald Trump a question on Wednesday as the intern tries to take his microphone away', 'The White House on Wednesday suspended the press', ""Several journalists and organizations — including the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Online News Association — demanded Acosta's press pass be reinstated"", ""Sanders, who hasn't said where the tweeted video came from, noted that it clearly shows Acosta made contact with the intern"", 'While the origin of the manipulated video is unclear, its distribution marked a new low for an administration that has been criticized for its willingness to mislead', 'The White House on Wednesday suspended the press pass of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after he and President Donald Trump had a heated confrontation']"
"– Despite her tears and public apologies, former Korean Air exec Cho Hyun-ah is facing criminal charges from South Korean prosecutors over her meltdown on a Dec. 5 flight out of New York, the BBC reports. According to a government investigation, Cho (also known as Heather Cho) became enraged when a flight attendant brought her macadamia nuts in a bag, not on a plate, so she screamed at him and demanded the plane be brought back to the gate to dump him. The crew chief also talked to local media and said that Cho cursed him out and jabbed him with a document folder, Reuters reports. Although Cho, the daughter of Korean Air CEO Cho Yang-ho, has since resigned from all posts, notes CNN, Seoul officials want to charge her with inflight violence and changing a flight route, the Guardian reports. Other people could also face repercussions: A current exec with the airline with the surname Yeo is being investigated for alleged attempts to cover up what happened, the Guardian notes; when the flight attendant in question was interviewed for the investigation, Yeo sat right next to him. And it hasn't gone unnoticed that most of the transport ministry officials now looking into the case have been employed by Korean Air at some point; separately, the BBC notes that one official was arrested today for allegedly leaking details of the investigation to Korean Air.

"– Montenegro is smaller than Connecticut and it has far fewer people, but the former Yugoslav republic is now punching well above its weight in international relations.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg—who declared ""the beginning of a very beautiful alliance"" during a meeting at alliance headquarters in Brussels—insists that the move was made without Russia in mind, Reuters notes, though the BBC reports that NATO diplomats say it's a message to Moscow that it cannot impede the alliance's expansion.

"– Just about one year after Michael Marin killed himself with a cyanide pill moments after being convicted of arson, a sex offender in Missouri has done the same. Steve Parsons, 48, had just been convicted of sodomizing a 14-year-old girl and sentenced to a maximum of seven years behind bars when he took the pill Thursday, the New York Daily News reports. He collapsed, started convulsing, and was dead of respiratory failure within minutes. He'd had 100 grams of cyanide shipped to himself overnight, Fox 4 reports, and he's thought to have actually walked into the courthouse with the pill in his mouth so it wouldn't be detected. ""I can’t speculate to what he was going through but I’m firmly convinced that his death was not a result of a wrongful verdict by the jury,"" says the prosecuting attorney.

"– Admit it: You weren't expecting the reviews for Noah to be good. But the biblical epic, directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, is actually getting a lot of praise—even if most of it acknowledges that the movie is nuts. Here's what people are saying: ""Noah is less an epic than a horror movie,"" writes AO Scott at the New York Times. ""The most potent special effects are Mr. Crowe’s eyes."" Crowe's Noah is ""a genocidal lunatic"" who believes he ""has been chosen not to save mankind but to ensure its annihilation."" Yeah, this is a dark, risky film, because Aronofsky ""takes the narrative and its implications seriously,"" imagining ""what it might have felt like to live in a newly created, already-ruined world."" ""First of all, let's acknowledge that Darren Aronofsky's Noah was a bad idea,"" writes Alex O'Hehir at Salon. But ""at least it's a bad idea on a grand scale."" Aronofsky seems to have realized how screwed he was, and gone wild, producing ""a grandiose and baffling journey that's almost worth taking. ... When it connects it's awesome, and when it doesn't it's awesomely silly."" It's ""like some hallucinogenic, parallel-universe version of the History Channel's Bible series,"" writes Stephen Rea at the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""Noah is not, for even one second, dull. Aronofsky's film is crazy, bold, and, yes, biblical,"" though it's unclear ""how all of this will play with by-the-book Christian moviegoers."" But Alonso Duralde at The Wrap thinks Aronofsky has actually reined himself in too much to avoid ruffling the faithful's feathers. ""Noah has snakes and bears and herbalist anesthesia and rock-angels and rampaging armies and panicky sinners, so why is it such a drag?"" he asks. It's ""a movie that will please neither the 'Son of God' crowd nor the people excited about a reunion between the director and leading lady of Requiem for a Dream.""","['Amid the CGI elephants, the Nick Nolte stone giants, the overacting and dialogue howlers, the WTF science-fiction flights of fancy and the attempt to wrest a dramatic plot out of a bare-bones mythological narrative, there’s considerable daring, fire and passion in this tale of watery apocalypse', 'As “Noah” tells it, the world was divided after Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden and Cain’s murder of Abel — the line of Cain built decadent cities and exploited the resources, and the line of Seth lived in peace and harmony', 'Unlike the thousands of CGI beasts of the land and air who hitch a ride on “Noah,” Darren Aronofsky‘s highly-anticipated epic is neither fish nor fowl; in no way is it a straightforward Bible tale (and given the brevity of Genesis’ account of the flood, such a thing would be next to impossible) nor is it the sort of unfettered freak-out that fans of “Black Swan,” “Pi” or “The Fountain” would expect from its director and co-writer (with Ari Handel)', 'This brings us, I suppose, to the Watchers, giant shambling creatures made of stone who help Noah’s family build the ark and also protect them against the rampaging hordes of Tubal-Cain in a tremendous and ridiculous battle sequence that has no relationship to anything in the Bible', 'of The Fountain; the comeback sad-sack of The Wrestler; and the psychologically damaged ballerina of Black Swan', 'This mightily strange motion picture, however, is a classic Hollywood blend of “devil’s candy” – a major movie star, the control-freak auteur of ""Black Swan,"" a budget reported at $130 million and one of the sketchiest episodes in the Abrahamic tradition, drawn from a few sentences in the Book of Genesis – designed to please everyone and likely to please almost no one', ""Oh, and to help Noah and his team erect their giant cargo container (that's what the ark looks like, football-field-long and coffin-shaped), there are the Watchers - the guardian angels from the Apocrypha, here like something out of the Marvel Comics Universe: towering, six-armed rock creatures, eyes burning with coal fire, voices rumbling like Nick Nolte after a case of whiskey and a carton of cigarettes"", 'None of them is as interesting as the diabolical and charismatic Tubal-Cain (growly voiced Ray Winstone), king of the Cain faction, who vows to kill Noah and take that damn ark for himself if the promised great flood actually shows up', 'Some might consider the story of Noah to be as much of a bad-luck charm to the movies as “Macbeth” is to the stage; the 1928 “Noah’s Ark,” produced by young Darryl F', 'That issue is completely ducked, by the way; the animals show up on their own, buzzing, hopping and crawling two by two, in a big CGI parade, and then Noah and his sons move through the ark with some kind of magical incense dispenser that makes them all go to sleep and not eat each other', 'Even there Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique deliver striking images – the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge pulsing like a human heart; the father and mother of us all as golden-hued, naked super aliens – but the net effect is something like a Catholic Sunday-school video mixed with the scenes Ridley Scott rejected as too hokey for “Prometheus', '“Noah” has its share of interesting ideas, from rock-covered fallen angels to Noah’s idea that he and his family should be the last human beings on earth, per his interpretation of what “the creator” tells him, but the film winds up feeling like a bit of a soggy slog, both overblown and underwritten', 'Then there’s Noah, who is descended from Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve (that part’s definitely in the Bible), and who lives out in the wilderness in hippie-mystical simplicity, literally raising his family on roots and berries (that part, not so much)', '"" It is up to Noah to build an ark and save the birds and beasts from the mighty deluge', 'There’s no real risk of issuing a spoiler to this story, is there?

"– An Oregon man who says he was fired from his construction job for refusing to attend Christian Bible study is appealing to a higher power: the court. In a lawsuit filed this month, Ryan Coleman, 34, says he didn't find out about the weekly Bible study requirement until after Joel Dahl of Albany-based Dahled Up Construction hired him as a painter in late 2017, OregonLive reports. He says he went along with it for about six months before telling Dahl, ""It's just not my thing."" Dahl's response, per Coleman, ""He said, 'well, I'm going to have to replace you."" That was in April, KEZI reports. Now, Coleman is seeking $800,000—$50,000 in lost earnings and $750,000 for ""severe emotional distress, anguish, humiliation, anger, shame, and anxiety,"" per the lawsuit's ironically titled ""prayer for relief."" Dahl's attorney, accusing Coleman of seeking ""unjustified financial gain,"" concedes that Dahled Up employees are required to go to Bible study. But it's legal, he argues, because they're still on the clock when they attend. Colman's attorney disagrees: ""This is so illegal,"" she says, adding that only religious organizations could have such a requirement. Dahl, who admits to past legal problems, says he's a ""second-chance employer,"" with OregonLive noting that ""God is a big part of Joel Dahl's life.""","['In April, Coleman said he once again told Dahl on the phone that he had a right not to attend the Bible study, and was then fired by Dahl', ""’ And he said, ‘Well, I’m going to have to replace you,'” Coleman told The Oregonian/OregonLive"", 'Coleman said he believed he had no other choice and went to the Bible study in order to keep his job', 'Coleman, who is not a practicing Christian, told Dahl he was not comfortable attending and that it was it illegal for him to require his employees to do so', 'Coleman’s past left him fearful that he wouldn’t be able to find other work, so he said stuck with the weekly, hourlong Bible study sessions for six months, until he took a stance and said he wouldn’t go', 'Dahl’s attorney Kent Hickman told the Oregonian that Dahl does require all his employees to attend Bible study and said it is legal because he pays them to attend', 'In order to keep his job, Coleman obliged for nearly six months but ultimately told Dahl he couldn’t go, the suit says', 'Coleman told Dahl that the requirement was illegal, but Dahl wouldn’t budge, according to the lawsuit', 'According to Coleman and his lawsuit, owner Joel Dahl told him all employees were required to partake in regular Bible study sessions led by a Christian pastor during the work day, while on the clock', 'Coleman worked for the small construction company from October 2017 to this past April, when he was fired, the suit states', 'However, he said Dahl insisted he attend', 'Soon after he started working there, he said he discovered his boss Joel Dahl required employees to attend a Christian Bible study during work time', 'Coleman claims Dahl and his company discriminated against him due to his religious beliefs and is asking for $800,000 in damages', 'Dahl feels that it’s unfortunate that he (Coleman) is now trying to exploit Mr', 'Dahl told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he’d struggled with drugs and alcohol and served time in prison for attempted second-degree assault', '“He said ‘You’re not going to tell me how to run my own company,’” Coleman continued']"
"– Venus is perhaps best known as ""that torrid acid bath next door,"" as Gizmodo puts it, with toxic thunderclouds and atmospheric pressure capable of crushing bones, per Science Alert—but it might have looked very different 700 million years ago. After plugging topographic data and the hydrogen isotope ratio in Venus' atmosphere into climate models, NASA researchers say Earth's closest planet neighbor may have had an average surface temperature of 52 degrees, with a maximum temperature of 95 degrees, and liquid water oceans up to 1,700 feet deep before volcanic activity gave it a facelift 700 million years ago, reports Engadget. In other words, it may have had ""the requirements for the origin of life"" as far back as 3 billion years ago, a researcher tells New Scientist. Of course this scenario depends on certain factors. If the planet spun significantly faster than it does today—spinning once on its axis every 16 Earth days, as opposed to 243—or had topography similar to Earth, it would have been much hotter, reaching a max temperature of 183 degrees, researchers write in Geophysical Research Letters. ""We really need more data before we can say much more … but if you have a Venus-like world around a solar-type star with a slow rotation, it could be quite a reasonable place for life to exist, especially in the oceans,"" says study author Michael Way. ""You get temperatures almost like Earth. That's remarkable."" Researchers hope a probe might eventually find signs of water erosion near Venus' equator, which would back up the model.

"– This week, Washington is hosting most of Africa's leaders for the White House's US-Africa Leaders Summit, which aims to forge stronger ties between the US and the continent, CNN reports. The event will address issues ranging from trade to security, the Wall Street Journal notes. A business forum is at the center of today's activities, the Hill notes, and the CEOs of Walmart, Coca-Cola, and IBM will be on hand as firms look for new investment opportunities.

"– China is engaged in something more than mere mischief on Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands, new satellite images have revealed. The Center for Strategic and International Studies says photos show that China is building an airstrip on an artificial island it has created, which would be its third large airstrip in the strategic South China Sea island chain, reports CNN, which notes that the photos were taken after China promised to halt land reclamation in the area. CSIS analysts say the nearly 2-mile airstrip will be big enough to take any plane the Chinese military has. Earlier satellite images revealed the construction of airstrips at Subi and Fiery Cross, and a CSIS analyst tells Reuters that with a third airstrip, China will be able to have ""more or less constant"" patrols in the area, which is also claimed in full or in part by Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. Over the last year, China has rapidly built what worried US commanders have called the ""Great Wall of Sand."" ""All of these places have gone from being outposts on stilts to full islands, potentially with airstrips, within the space of a year or just over a year,"" a CSIS analyst tells CNN. The US has repeatedly expressed concerns about the construction, which is expected to be high on the agenda when Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the US next week.","['Hong Kong (CNN) China appears to building a third airstrip in disputed waters in the South China Sea, according to new satellite images analyzed by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)', 'Three airstrips, once completed, would allow China to threaten all air traffic over the features it has reclaimed in the South China Sea, he said, adding that it would be especially worrying if China were to install advanced air defenses', ""It's similar to airstrips that China has been building on artificial islands at the Fiery Cross and Subi reefs in the contested Spratly Islands"", 'WASHINGTON China appears to be building a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea, a U', 'Asked about Mischief Reef on Monday, China\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei repeated China\'s claim to ""indisputable sovereignty"" over the Spratly Islands and its right to establish military facilities there', 'A new airstrip at Mischief Reef would be particularly worrying for the Philippines, a rival claimant in the South China Sea', 'The images, taken September 8, come after China pledged to bring land reclamation in those waters to a halt, and will make for uncomfortable discussions when Chinese President Xi Jinping visits Washington next week', ""worries about China's increasingly assertive territorial claims are expected to be high on the agenda"", '""If it does turn out to be a runway, China will have three airstrips that can carry any plane the PLA (People\'s Liberation Army) has to offer,"" he said', 'China stepped up creation of artificial islands in the South China Sea last year, drawing strong criticism from Washington', 'Chinese dredging vessels are purportedly seen in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea in this still image from video taken by a P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft provided by the United States Navy May 21, 2015', 'It would allow China to mount ""more or less constant"" patrols over Reed Bank, where the Philippines has long explored for oil and gas, Poling said', '8 show construction on Mischief Reef, one of several artificial islands China has created in the Spratly archipelago']"
"– US relations with China took a potentially nasty turn on Monday when President Trump ordered a preliminary inquiry into Beijing's trade practices. Even before Trump formally signed a memorandum to put things in motion, China made it clear it was unhappy. The move will hurt the US economy and ""poison"" US-China relations, declared an editorial in the official China Daily newspaper, per Reuters. And a foreign ministry spokeswoman warned of a potential trade war with ""no winner,"" per the AP. The basics: Trump directed his top trade official, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, to look into whether China is treating US businesses unfairly and infringing on their intellectual property, per CNBC. Lighthizer's task is to figure out whether a larger, formal investigation is warranted. There's no timetable, but it could take him up to a year. Which means: This isn't so much an investigation as it is an investigation into an investigation, and this interim move could give the two sides time to work something out before things get too far along, explains the New York Times. Trump: ""It's a very big move,"" the president said in signing the memorandum. He called it an important step to ""protect the intellectual property of American companies"" and thus American jobs. See the video. One main complaint: China often forces US companies who want to work in the nation to partner with Chinese companies and thus share proprietary tech secrets, per the Times. A member of a bipartisan group called the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission says the White House action is ""long overdue"" because “China’s been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of US technologies and intellectual property for years."" Too soft? China may be ticked, but Trump critics such as Sen. Charles Schumer think the White House is going easy on Beijing. ""To make an announcement that they're going to decide whether to have an investigation on China's well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to China that it is OK to keep stealing."" North Korea: Of course, all this is playing out amid the backdrop of North Korea, with the White House hoping to get China to help rein in the North. There are two schools of thought on that: This inquiry could be leverage to pressure China, notes the Washington Post, or it could backfire and make Beijing more reluctant than ever to help the US. The story notes that the announcement seems to have been delayed to come after the US got China to go along with UN sanctions on Pyongyang.

"– Perhaps the true marker of celebrity is not a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but an unusual restaurant food dish named in your honor. Below are five celebrities you can literally order off a menu. The ""Martha Stewart"" hot dog: A hot dog is not exactly the kind of haute cuisine you'd expect to be associated with the queen of homemaking, but for $6.95 at Pink's Hot Dogs in Los Angeles, you can get a 9"" inch dog topped with relish, onions, bacon, chopped tomatoes, sauerkraut, and sour cream. Martha has even stopped by to try it herself! The ""Lady Gaga"" sushi roll: Various Japanese restaurants across the U.S. have named sushi rolls after the singer, including at least one that features BBQ eel. Considering Lady Gaga reportedly installed a $70K Japanese fish collection, it seems an appropriate homage. The ""Avril Lavigne"" pizza: At La Pizzeria in the Canadian singer's hometown of Napanee, Ontario, you can order a pepperoni, mushrooms, and green olive pie in honor of Avril, who, for the record, no longer eats those toppings. The ""Joaquin Phoenix"" vegan sandwich: The actor has been a committed vegan since the age of 3, so it's fitting that his sandwich at Two Beards Deli in Grand Rapids, MI contains ""curry tofu salad"" and veggies. The ""Alyssa Milano"" chicken sandwich: At Lioni Italian Heroes in Brooklyn, NY, there are numerous sandwiches on the menu named after celebrities, but the ""Alyssa Milano,"" a chicken cutlet hero with prosciutto, mozzarella, and basil, is a favorite among regulars.
