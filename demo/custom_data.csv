His remarks came close on the heels of India voting in favour of the United Nations resolution that condemned settlement activities in “the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan”. India was among 145 nations that voted in favour of the resolution, with seven countries - including Canada ad Israel - voting against, and 18 abstaining. In October, India abstained in the UN General Assembly from voting on a draft resolution by Jordan, which called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict. In a statement explaining its decision, India said that the resolution did not make any mention of the terrorist group. The resolution titled 'Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations' was overwhelmingly adopted with 120 nations voting in its favour, 14 against it and 45 abstaining.
India has maintained its call for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, and reiterated to protect civilians caught in the Israel-Hamas crossfire.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi today condemned the deaths of civilians in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and highlighted the urgent need for unity and cooperation among the Global South in the face of escalating challenges rising in West Asia due to the conflict.
Speaking at the e inaugural session of the 2nd Voice of Global South Summit, PM Modi emphasised India's unwavering stance against violence and terrorism, including the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel. The Prime Minister underscored the importance of exercising restraint and prioritising dialogue as the cornerstones of conflict resolution.
""We all are seeing that new challenges are emerging from the events in the West Asia region. India has condemned the terrorist attack in Israel on October 7,"" PM Modi said. ""We have exercised restraint as well. We have given emphasis on dialogue and diplomacy. We also strongly condemn the deaths of civilians in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.""
""After talking to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, we have also sent humanitarian aid to the people of Palestine. This is the time when the countries of the Global South should unite for the greater global good,"" he added. 
The Global South refers to a collection of countries, primarily situated in the Southern Hemisphere in Asia, Africa and South America, with varied levels of economic development. While these countries do not share identical characteristics, they often grapple with common challenges such as poverty, inequality, and limited access to resources. Over 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed after the Palestinian group Hamas launched a sensational land-sea-air assault on October 7. In retaliation, Israel pounded the Gaza Strip - a Hamas stronghold - with airstrikes, killing over 11,000 people in the densely populated Palestinian enclave. 
The Prime Minister advocated for a collaborative strategy guided by the 'five Cs' principles: consultation, communication, cooperation, creativity, and capacity building.

Modi made the remarks in his televised opening address at the second virtual Voice of Global South Summit, a mechanism created by India to bring together developing countries and to seek their recommendations for the country’s G20 presidency. Modi largely spoke on the achievements of the G20 presidency but referred to the crisis triggered by the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas. “For global progress, sabka saath, sabka vikas (with everyone and progress for everyone) is necessary but we are all seeing that new challenges are emerging from the incidents in West Asia,” he said, speaking in Hindi.
India had condemned the horrific terror attacks in Israel on October 7 and called for restraint along with dialogue and diplomacy, he said. “We strongly condemn the death of civilians in the conflict between Israel and Hamas,” he added.
Modi said that following his phone conversation with President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian National Authority, India sent humanitarian assistance for the people of Palestine. “This is the time when countries of the Global South must talk in one voice for the greater global good,” he said.
In keeping with the theme of “one earth, one family, one future” for India’s G20 presidency, all countries should move forward with 5Cs – consultation, cooperation, communication, creativity and capacity building, Modi said. India had initially backed Israel’s right to defend itself, but it has since adopted a more nuanced approach by calling for observance of international humanitarian law and avoiding of civilian casualties. While the Hamas attacks intense killed 1,200 people, Israel’s intense bombardment of northern Gaza has killed more than 11,400 people, including some 4,400 children.
Modi also spoke about forward movement on several initiatives unveiled at the first Voice of Global South Summit in January. He inaugurated Dakshin, a centre of excellence for the Global South that will focus on development and knowledge sharing. “During the G20 Summit, on behalf of India, I had proposed to launch a weather and climate monitoring satellite for the Global South. We are working rapidly on this,” he said.
He described Voice of Global South as a unique platform for the changing world of the 21st century that gives a voice to developing countries for the first time. When India became the chair of the G20 last December, it adopted the responsibility of taking forward the issues and concerns of the Global South, he added. He highlighted several achievements of the G20 that are important for the Global South, including the inclusion of the African Union as a full member of the grouping of 20 largest economies, agreement on major reforms of multilateral development banks and the focus on sustainable finance for developing countries.
An action plan to speed up implementation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) will strengthen poverty reduction programmes in the Global South, and there was agreement on providing climate transition finance and technology to developing countries on easy terms. The launch of the Global Biofuel Alliance was very important for the Global South. “We hope that you will all join this,” Modi said.
India also believes that new technologies should not become a way to increase the divide between North and South, and that there is a great need for responsible use of technology in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). “To take this forward, the AI Global Partnership Summit is being organised in India next month,” he said.
The digital public infrastructure (DPI) framework adopted by the G20 will help with the last mile delivery of essential services and increase inclusivity, while India is creating a DPI repository to share its capabilities with the Global South.
Several heads of state and government joined the inaugural session of the virtual summit, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasona, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth."
