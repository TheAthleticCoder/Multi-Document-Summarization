"– Skal, Sweden! Raise a glass to the Scandinavian nation, which beat out 162 others to win the overall top spot in the ""Good Country Index,"" a ranking of the world's countries, the Independent reports. The list is based on 35 various indicators from sources such as the World Bank and the UN, separated into the categories of culture, science and tech, prosperity and equality, world order, international peace and security, planet and climate, and health and well-being. The US just missed making the top 20, coming in at No. 21. And in last place—Libya.

"– Archaeologists have uncovered another parking lot find, only this time it's in Scotland, and what they discovered is best described as a ""Thing."" Yep, that's the technical term for a Viking parliamentary gathering site, one of which has been unearthed in the town of Dingwall. That name had long clued archaeologists into the potential for such a find: Dingwall is likely derived from the word thingvellir, or ""the field of the assembly,"" LiveScience reports. But finding a ""Thing"" site is no small task, in part because the gatherings usually occurred in open fields, and the temporary nature of them meant only modest traces of human life were left behind. Indeed, this is only the second ""Thing"" found in the UK, the Scotsman reports. It was uncovered after the team used historical records to identify a mound that had once been called the ""assembly mound""; a parking lot now covers it. Excavations ""indicated that the mound was man-made,"" likely in the 11th century, says site director Oliver JT O'Grady, and ""radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider."" He and his team aren't exactly sure who built the site, but based on its size, that creator would have needed both ""political power and resources,"" explains LiveScience. One guess: Thorfinn the Mighty, who fought a battle in the area around that time.

"– There's a family of 12 in Montgomery, Ala., that calls itself the ""Brainy Bunch,"" and for good reason. Kip and Mona Lisa Harding's seven oldest children were all in college by the age of 12, KSL.com reports. At 22, Serennah Harding may be the youngest doctor of osteopathic medicine in the country; Rosannah became an architect at 18. Heath isn't just an entrepreneur at 17—he also has his master's degree in computer science. Then there’s the engineer, the composer, and the would-be archaeologist (a college sophomore at 13) and one-day lawyer (taking college classes at 10)… Their parents say their children aren’t geniuses, but that they simply found a way to make education quick and fun for the home-schooled kids. Mona Lisa, who is following her kids' lead by earning her bachelor's degree now, explains the family quickly broke away from the ""tedious"" nature of ""boxed curriculum and went into just reading for pleasure and reading what the kids wanted to read."" When Mona Lisa was unable to keep up with her oldest daughter in math, she enrolled her in online college courses, Mona Lisa told the Today Show, where she appeared with the family earlier this month to promote their new book, The Brainy Bunch. An online poll conducted by Today showed that 93% of respondents would not want their children to grow up like the Hardings, but the kids sound pretty pleased with their childhood experiences.

"– An elementary school teacher is in hot water after allegedly developing a secret relationship with her 11-year-old student, WPXI reports via Gawker. Geraldine Alcorn, 28, was arraigned last week in Pittsburgh on charges that include corruption of minors and child luring, and freed on $100,000 bond. She was also warned to keep away from the child, and little wonder: The Beechwood Elementary School teacher is accused of planning to adopt and ""run away"" with the girl, whose mom says letters in the girl's schoolbook had labels like ""Things Ms. Alcorn and I can do"" and ""When we can do it."" Police say Alcorn hid her phone number in the girl's math worksheet (by circling the relevant numbers) and even took the child to the teacher's Bloomfield home. Pittsburgh Public Schools officials learned about an ""improper attachment"" and suspended Alcorn, who resigned March 2. But after Alcorn returned to school to pick up her belongings on March 13, the girl discovered ""gifts and several letters, some encrypted, in her locker and desk,"" says a criminal complaint. ""The letters, written by Alcorn, instructed the 11-year-old female to contact her."" Police don't believe the relationship was sexual, and say that text messages between the two—including 2,400 in just two weeks—express a ""deep love"" on both sides. As for who's at fault, a local mom points to the school district: ""Where are background checks of teachers?"" she asks CBS Pittsburgh.

"– You probably know that walking into a grocery store on an empty stomach is unwise. Now a new study suggests walking into a mall while hungry is just as bad—at least for your wallet. The study's title sums up the finding: ""Hunger promotes acquisition of nonfood objects."" Reporting in the journal PNAS, researchers at the University of Minnesota say they conducted five experiments whose results consistently showed an increase in the desire to acquire things when people reported being hungry. In one experiment where the items (in this case, binder clips) were free, the hungry cohort left with 70% more than satiated participants. And even when people had to pay (this time for department store items), the hungry ones spent 64% more. ""It's probably better to feed yourself before any type of shopping, whether you're going on an actual shopping trip or shopping online,"" researcher Alison Jing Xu tells Smithsonian. ""And if you're really hungry, you'd better think twice before purchasing any items at all or you might regret those purchases later."" (The study notes that ""hunger does not influence how much they like nonfood objects."") New Scientist reports Xu was inspired by a shopping trip of her own, during which she bought 10 pairs of tights on an empty stomach, ""not just the two I needed."" She says ghrelin, a hormone released by the stomach that makes people seek out food, may also affect other behaviors. (Doctors are puzzled by a boy who's never hungry.)","['We test whether the acquisition component spills over to nonfood objects: Are hungry people more likely to acquire objects that cannot satisfy their hunger?

"– The mountaineers who discovered the bodies of long-lost American climbers Alex Lowe and David Bridges in Tibet left them untouched out of respect—and it took them days to realize who they were. Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck tells Reuters that he was on the way up Mount Shishapangma with German climber David Goettler when they found the bodies encased in ice at 19,356 feet. The men, who perished in an October 1999 avalanche, were just 6 feet apart. ""We did not touch them out of respect and left the bodies on the mountain in the same position as we had discovered [them],"" says Steck, considered one of the world's best mountaineers—just as Lowe was at the time of his death, notes the Guardian. ""We didn't realize this could be Alex and David. But when we were back in base camp we were talking about this and were like—oh, these two bodies could be,"" Steck tells the AP. Goettler called Conrad Anker, who survived the 1999 avalanche. Based on the description of the men's clothing and gear, Anker said he was sure that the bodies were those of Lowe, considered the best American climber of his generation, and renowned cameraman Bridges. Steck and Goettler were the only climbers to attempt the difficult southern route of Shishapangma this year, but they were unable to reach the summit in two attempts because of bad weather. Anker married Lowe's widow, Jennifer, in 2001 and adopted his three sons. ""Conrad, the boys, and I will make our pilgrimage to Shishapangma,"" Jennifer Lowe-Anker said in a statement after the bodies were found. ""It is time to put Alex to rest.""

"– A freak accident left the University of Connecticut reeling in October; now, six arrests may have it reeling once more. Jeffny Pally was sitting up against a garage bay door at a fire station near her dorm on the Storrs campus around 1:15am when the door opened as fire crews responded to a call. The 19-year-old sophomore fell back and was struck by a Chevy Tahoe leaving the firehouse. Why she chose to sit in front of the bay remains unknown, but police say they've pieced together what allegedly happened in the hours beforehand. On the evening of Oct. 15, Pally attended a party at the Kappa Sigma fraternity that revolved around building a homecoming parade float; now six frat members have been charged with alcohol-related offenses related to Pally's death, reports the Hartford Courant. Pally arrived around 10:30pm and stayed about two hours, during which witnesses say she had one to five beers; she reportedly drank prior to the party, and her blood alcohol content was .25. Patrick Callahan, Matthew Moll, Austin Custodio, and Dominic Godi, all 21, and Dylan Morose and Jonathan Polansky, 22, face varied charges tied to allegedly purchasing and transporting the booze and permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. Their arraignment is set for March 8. The 60-year-old shift commander who drove the Tahoe told police he did feel a bump as he exited, but assumed what he saw in his rearview mirror was fire equipment.

"– President Trump is no stranger to scandal, but reports that he asked former FBI director James Comey to halt the investigation of Michael Flynn may have taken things to the next level. The report may have been the last straw for congressional Republicans, who appeared to be shifting against Trump on Tuesday night, Politico reports. House Oversight Committee Rep. Jason Chaffetz says he has asked the FBI for Comey's memos on the Trump request and other interactions with the president and he is ready to issue subpoenas if necessary. Some legal analysts say there could now be an obstruction of justice case against Trump, though it could be tough to prove. The latest: Obstruction of justice. The New York Times describes obstruction of justice as a ""murky"" charge, the exact definition of which was being hotly debated on Capitol Hill Tuesday night. Experts say it could certainly cover asking the FBI director to drop its investigation and then firing him. Any criminal case would probably have to prove that Trump had ""corrupt intentions,"" though if Trump is tried, it will be by Congress, not the courts. ""If this were anyone other than the president, it is classic, vanilla obstruction,"" former federal prosecutor Jeff Cramer tells Politico. The showdown. It now appears certain that a ""theatrical showdown"" between Trump and Comey looms, with Americans having to decide whose word they trust more, CNN reports. Comey is expected to be called to testify before Congress about the Feb. 14 meeting with Trump. Reasons for Trump to worry. The Times' sources say Comey kept detailed memos about his meetings with Trump, which ""should strike fear into the White House,"" according to the Washington Post. The notes may describe other times Trump allegedly crossed the line—and courts in previous cases have considered memos from FBI directors to be credible evidence. ""Reasonable objections."" The National Review notes that while there is ""no good outcome"" here, it is premature to say Trump is doomed to face impeachment proceedings: The allegation has not been proven, and the ""reasonable objections"" include Sen. Lindsey Graham's observation: ""If this happened, the FBI director should have done something about it or quit."" GOP reaction. Republican lawmakers including House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Frank Meadows are calling for an investigation of the ""disturbing"" allegation. Some have signaled that their patience is wearing out. ""This weekly scandal, this weekly controversy is unhealthy for the country. It’s a major distraction for the country and it’s just bad for the psyche of every American,"" said Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, per Politico. Nixon comparisons. There are many comparisons to the Watergate scandal being made. Vox notes that what ended Richard Nixon's presidency wasn't the Watergate break-in itself—his involvement was never proven—but his attempt to force the FBI to abandon its investigation. Prison for the press. CNBC notes that amid the Flynn uproar, another allegation has been overlooked: Trump also allegedly asked Comey to consider imprisoning members of the press for publishing classified allegations that had been leaked.","[""We also know that Trump asked the Director of National Intelligence and the director of the National Security Agency to publicly deny the existence of collusion between his campaign and Russia — an attempt at interference in the intelligence community that calls directly to mind Nixon's attempt to use the CIA to scuttle an FBI probe"", ""But it is also possible that given his administration's history of repeated falsehoods, exaggerations and blatant untruths, on issues from the size of the inauguration crowds to claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, the President may not come across as a particularly credible witness in the court of public opinion"", 'Those unflattering impressions are not likely to be improved if Trump, ever the showman

investigation into the break-in', 'The disclosure by the New York Times Tuesday, which was confirmed by POLITICO, that an FBI memo indicated that Trump asked Comey at a February White House meeting if

"– Donald Trump has chosen a wrestling exec to head the Small Business Administration, but he's not getting Rocky to head the National Endowment for the Arts. Sylvester Stallone announced late Sunday that he isn't interested in taking the arts leadership role in the Trump administration, though he might be willing to take a post where he could help veterans. ""I am incredibly flattered to have been suggested to be involved with the National Endowment of the Arts,"" Stallone said in a statement. ""However, I believe I could be more effective by bringing national attention to returning military personnel in an effort to find gainful employment, suitable housing, and financial assistance these heroes respectfully deserve."" Insiders tell the New York Times that Trump allies had spoken to the star about the arts job, though no formal offer had been made. The NEA, a federal agency currently headed by Obama appointee Jane Chu, a musician and artist, grants funding to cultural projects.

It's not clear whether there will be another role available for Stallone in the Trump administration.

"– Shoes and handbags go together like … well, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, now that the latter has agreed to purchase the former for $1.2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports. Michael Kors is looking to bolster its business with the luxury shoe brand as sales of its own handbags falter, with a Customer Growth Partners analyst noting just a 2% recent growth in the handbag market overall, as opposed to 15% growth six years ago. Reuters notes that Michael Kors has lost 65% of its market value since 2014. Michael Kors' sales may have taken a hit by the company permitting its product to be sold at a discount in outlets and department stores, making it harder to command full price in its own.

"– Yet another beauty pageant scandal: Less than two weeks after Amanda Longacre was crowned Miss Delaware, she's been stripped of the title because pageant officials say she's too old. Longacre is 24, and will still be 24 when the Miss America pageant is held in September—and she says she was told that as long as she was 24 during the Miss America competition, her age was not an issue. But officials now say that according to the fine print, Miss America can't turn 25 any time in 2014; Longacre's birthday is in October, the Smyrna-Clayton Sun-Times explains. Longacre had no trouble while competing on the local level, and when she advanced to the state level, she says her age and birthday were clearly stated on her contract, which the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization signed, she tells NBC Philadelphia. The organization verified her birth certificate, license, and social security card before the competition. A media relations coordinator for the Miss Delaware organization even confirms that Longacre didn't do anything wrong, and calls the whole thing ""a terrible mistake."" After being told on Tuesday she'd be losing her title (plus prizes including $11,000 in scholarship money), Longacre says officials have been ""ignoring"" her. Making things worse: She had deferred her master's program and her Department of Justice internship for a year so that she could fulfill her Miss Delaware duties.

"– A 6-week-old baby died in a horrific accident Thursday in a New York City building where there had been dozens of complaints about faulty elevators. Police say baby Areej Ali's mother was waiting for the elevator in the Brooklyn building Thursday morning when the doors opened, only for her and the stroller to plunge down the shaft, the AP reports. The baby girl's mother, who was injured in the fall, told investigators that she had stepped forward without realizing that there was no elevator behind the doors. The New York Daily News reports that mother and baby fell several feet onto the roof of an elevator, which then plummeted around eight stories. The baby was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital. The Daily News reports that there have been at least 20 complaints about the 23-story building's elevators in the last two years alone, and a mechanic was working on them at the time of the accident. Residents say they are shocked by the little girl's death—but not overly surprised to learn that the building's elevators were involved. ""My heart is really bleeding for them,"" a resident and mother of four tells the New York Post. ""This always happens in this building.

"– In what some are calling one sign of an improving economy, if at the expense of newlyweds, a new survey by The Knot finds that the average cost of a US wedding jumped to $31,213 last year, marking a five-year high when adjusted for inflation. In its eighth report, the wedding site reveals in a press release that when it came to the 16,000 brides and grooms married in 2014 and then surveyed, most couples split that bill evenly with the bride's parents: On average, each footed 43% of the bill, with the groom's parents chipping in 12%. In fact, only 12% of couples paid for their weddings themselves. And sticking to the budget is apparently tough: 45% of couples didn't manage to do so (another 23% didn't even make a budget). As for the dress, brides spent an average $1,357. The survey also found that the most expensive place to wed was Manhattan, where the average price tag was $76,328 (which is actually down almost $10,000 from the previous year), while the least expensive was Utah, where weddings cost less than half the national average at $15,257. Couples are spending more per head, too, as the average guest list shrunk from 149 in 2009 to 136 in 2014. On the subject of marriage and money, according to a February Redfin survey, 38% of millennials say they have or intend to put off marrying so they can afford to buy a home, reports Bloomberg Business. MarketWatch notes the average wedding price happens to be $92 less than a 15% down payment on a $208,700 home—the country's median price last quarter.

"– President Trump himself hasn't addressed Monday's miserable day for the stock market, but two White House officials made a point to downplay the trouble and emphasize perspective. ""Look markets do fluctuate,"" said deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah. ""But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong."" Press chief Sarah Huckabee Sanders said similarly that the ""president's focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong."" As many outlets are now pointing out, Trump has repeatedly boasted of the booming stock market. In his recent State of the Union address, for example, he spoke of it smashing ""one record after the other,"" notes USA Today, which rounds up several tweets from Trump with a similar sentiment. Despite Monday's 1,175-point loss, the Dow is still up 23% since Trump took office, reports Business Insider. But the rough day illustrates the danger of the president taking too much credit for the market's performance, notes Politico. “This is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,” Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners tells the news site. “Until now, Trump’s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed.""

"– Led Zeppelin is reissuing its first three albums in June, but ahead of that comes a little more love for fans. Actually, it's a ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""Keys to the Highway""—previously unreleased versions that Jimmy Page culled from the band's vault in a two-year labor of love. ""I don't want to die and have somebody else do it,"" he tells the BBC, which has clips of the songs. ""I'm authoritative about what was done in the first place,"" and the new music ""deserves to be heard."" ""Keys to the Highway"" was recorded in 1970, in what Robert Plant calls ""a particularly prolific time where we were learning about each other's capabilities. Jimmy and I were just fooling around."" The ""Whole Lotta Love"" track is an early version—missing some vocals, slide guitar, the middle section, and first chorus—which makes one ""realize just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is"" in the final track, Plant says. He adds a pretty frank assessment of his own skills at the time: ""My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn't I shut up a bit?

"– Prodigy, one half of iconic rap duo Mobb Deep, died Tuesday in Las Vegas. He was 42. Born Albert Johnson, the rapper was hospitalized after a weekend performance ""for complications caused by sickle cell anemia,"" a disease he'd battled since birth, his publicist says in a statement. An official cause of death is not known, reports NPR.

"– The fast-paced world of social media wasn't quite so speedy at the Mitt Romney presidential campaign. Sure, tweets may only be 140 characters at most, but they required the approval of 22 different people ""towards the end of the campaign,"" a digital media campaign staffer says in a new study.

"– In all of Israeli history, only one man has been sentenced to death by a civilian court and then executed: Adolf Eichmann. On Wednesday, the country released the Nazi's handwritten plea for clemency, penned two days before he was hanged. The AFP reports the release coincides with International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and quotes, along with the BBC and Ynetnews, from the May 29, 1962, letter, in which Eichmann tries to make the case that he was merely following orders when he implemented the ""Final Solution"": ""[The judges] made a fundamental mistake in that they are not able to empathize with the time and situation in which I found myself during the war years. There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders. Had I been, as the judges assume, the fanatical driving force in the persecution of the Jews, this should have been reflected in a promotion and other rewards, but I was never granted any benefit. I am not able to recognize the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honor Mr. President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out."" The Times of Israel reports that Eichmann—who fled a POW camp after the war, made his way to Argentina, and was kidnapped by Israeli intelligence agents in 1960—was cremated hours after his May 31 hanging; his ashes were spread in the Mediterranean Sea.

"– One of the three suspects in the London Bridge attack was known to police. Khuram Shazad Butt, who may have had links to jihadist group Al-Muhajiroun, had been the subject of a Metropolitan Police investigation beginning in 2015. However, the investigation was ""prioritized in the lower echelons"" because ""there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned,"" a rep tells the BBC. A man and a woman living in east London had both contacted police about Butt, with the woman suggesting he had tried to radicalize her children. According to the Times, Butt had links to both radical Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and Mohammad Sidique Khan, who planned the 2005 London bombings. Khan worked at an Ilford fitness center that Butt, a 27-year-old father of two, would frequent to try and radicalize youth, the Times reports. Butt also appeared in a 2016 Channel 4 documentary about Islamist extremists with ties to Choudary. He was seen arguing with police after carrying an Islamic State flag. Yet Butt still managed to get a job with the London Underground. The UK citizen born in Pakistan served as a trainee customer service assistant for almost six months in 2016, per the BBC. ""People are going to look at the front pages today and they are going to say 'how on earth could we have let this guy—or possible more—through the net,'"" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says, per Buzzfeed.

"– Researchers at Stanford University have discovered what a press release calls a ""fast and efficient"" way to stop jet lag before it starts: repeatedly flashing light into your eyes while you sleep. ""If you are flying to New York tomorrow, tonight you use the light therapy,"" Dr. Jamie Zeitzer says. ""If you normally wake up at 8am, you set the flashing light to go off at 5am. When you get to New York, your biological system is already in the process of shifting to East Coast time."" A flash every 10 seconds for one hour, used toward the end of the night, will push the body's circadian rhythm forward by about two hours, the Wall Street Journal explains. Using the flashes of light at the beginning of the night, on the other hand, will delay the circadian clock and could be helpful when the aforementioned traveler heads back to the West Coast. Current in-advance methods for dealing with jet lag and sleep-cycle issues involve continuous light administered while awake. Not only did the study find flashing lights to be more effective—they change the body's circadian rhythm up to three times faster than a steady light—they don't interrupt a person's life. ""Most people can sleep through the flashing light just fine,"" Zeitzer says in the press release. Researchers are hoping to have a light-flashing sleep mask available for consumers later this year. This same method could be used to help people who work the night shift or have seasonal affective disorder. And researchers are currently testing it on a group of teens to improve school performance. ""We’re basically looking to intentionally jet lag teens so that they can go to bed at a reasonable time,"" Zeitzer tells the Journal.

"– Arthritis causes pain and suffering for millions of people around the world, but it's also the byproduct of an evolutionary mutation that allowed early humans to make the move from Africa to colder climates tens of thousands of years ago. Researchers at Stanford University have discovered that a genetic variation made humans shorter and more compact as a means of protecting them against frostbite in the colder temperatures of northern climates, Newsweek reports. In addition, their limbs got shorter, making them less vulnerable to breaking if people should, say, slip on ice. The downside of this evolutionary adaptation was an increase in the likelihood of osteoarthritis. The Stanford study, published Monday in Nature Genetics, shows how a variation in the GDF5 gene became more prevalent in humans moving out of Africa into colder climates 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. This variation doubles the chances of developing painful joint problems while also reducing height by about 0.4 inches on average, the Telegraph reports. And since arthritis generally doesn't develop until after the age of reproduction, the gene mutation was passed on from generation to generation. The Stanford researchers discovered that the genetic variation causing this increase in arthritis is common among Europeans but rare in African populations. (A Canadian woman's arthritis may qualify her for euthanasia.)","['Although it may seem like an evolutionary disadvantage to be shorter and less mobile, in fact, it helped early humans to ward off the freezing temperatures of the north as they ventured out of Africa for the first time around 50,000 years ago', 'When they looked for GROW1 in the 1,000 Genomes Project database—a huge database of genetic sequences of human populations around the world—the team found a single change that is very common in European and Asian populations, but is hardly ever seen in Africans', 'The team then introduced this change to mice and found it led to reduced activity in the growth of bones', 'Researchers in the US have discovered that a gene mutation which increases the risk of arthritis evolved in the Ice Age to help protect our ancestors from frostbite', 'In the latest research, the scientists find GDF5 provided an evolutionary boost for our ancestors, with arthritis apparently a byproduct of it', 'The team says the benefits of being shorter in colder conditions probably outweighed the risk of developing osteoarthritis in later life', 'In a study published in Nature Genetics on Monday, scientists at Stanford University, California, have shown how variants within the GDF5 gene, which are related to reduced growth, was repeatedly favored by our ancestors as they migrated out of Africa and across the continents', 'They then looked at the change to the genetic variant over the course of human evolution, and found it had been repeatedly favored after Homo sapiens left Africa between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago', 'Previous research has shown how mutations in part of the GDF5 gene cause malformation in bone structure in mice', 'To better understand GDF5, the team studied the DNA sequences that might affect how the gene is expressed—specifically those that are known as promoters and enhancers', '""The gene we are studying shows strong signatures of positive selection in many human populations,"" senior author David Kingsley said in a statement', '“For example, the first anatomically modern humans found outside of Africa (in the Middle East, and later in Europe and then East Asia) were all quite tall—height only declined after the Upper Paleolithic (20,000+ years later),�? he tells Newsweek']"

"– ""Bigfoot"" has been found, just not the apish version. An international team of paleontologists has announced the discovery of the largest known dinosaur foot, which belonged to a close relative of the Brachiosaurus now dubbed ""Bigfoot."" Appropriately so, as a nearly complete left hind-foot fossil totaling 13 bones, found two decades ago in the Black Hills area of Wyoming alongside separate and smaller brachiosaur remains, shows the 80-foot-long sauropod had feet that were about 3 feet wide, report Live Science and Gizmodo. ""There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet,"" researcher Emanuel Tschopp explains in a release. Described in journal PeerJ, ""this beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America."" Researchers, who compared the foot to those of other dino species, believe it came from a brachiosaur that lived 150 million years ago, making it the first brachiosaur foot known to come from North America's Late Jurassic Period, per Mashable. Though it's not enough to identify a specific species, it's evidence that brachiosaurs covered a larger area of North America, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming, than previously known. ""This is surprising"" as ""many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas,"" Tschopp says. Noting the discovery occurred ""several hundreds of miles from where we thought these guys were,"" fellow researcher David Burnham will look to answer new questions: ""Is it a different species than the brachiosaurs down south?

"– President Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, got a restraining order against Stormy Daniels last month in an attempt to keep the adult film star from speaking out about her alleged 2006 affair with Trump, the New York Times reports. The temporary Feb. 27 order, obtained in a private arbitration meeting with a retired judge, prohibits Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) from discussing ""confidential information"" related to the nondisclosure agreement she signed in Oct. 2016, NBC News reports. Daniels' lawyer tells NBC that Cohen has continued to make efforts to silence Daniels via ""threats"" and ""intimidation"" since the order was procured, warning her she is subject to damages should she talk. In her lawsuit against Trump attempting to have the NDA declared invalid, filed Tuesday, Daniels refers to a ""bogus,"" ""improper and procedurally defective arbitration proceeding hidden from public view,"" the AP reports. Cohen's own attorney says the NDA Daniels signed included an arbitration clause with permission to ""seek an injunction in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the agreement,"" and that ""the designated judge from the arbitration tribunal found that Ms. Clifford had violated the agreement and enjoined her from, among other things, filing [her lawsuit against Trump]."" Also Wednesday, White House rep Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump denies ""all of these allegations""—both the affair and any knowledge of Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels—and that ""this case [has] already been won in arbitration."" Her exact meaning was not clear, as Trump is not listed as a party on the restraining order, and CNN's Chris Cillizza notes several of Sanders' ""non-answers"" skirt the issue of whether Trump knew about the hush money.

Per the Washington Post, Spirit owner Bill Lynch, an Air Force veteran, made sure the anthem was played at Maryland SoccerPlex only after his team and Rapinoe's Seattle Reign FC headed to the locker room after warmups, a preemptive strike against Rapinoe's anticipated repeat of her protest at a Sunday night game (a show of support for the 49ers' QB Colin Kaepernick). ""We understand this may be seen as an extraordinary step, but believe it was the best option to avoid taking focus away from the game on such an important night for our franchise,"" the Spirit said in a statement, referencing its last regular-season home game that could help earn it a first-place slot.

One other person not aware in advance of the Spirit's plans, per the Post: National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Jeff Plush, who says he was ""disappointed"" by Lynch's move.

The Copenhagen Post reports the cover weighs about 155 pounds, and reports that you had to pass through the hatch in order to reach the bridge to steer the submarine. Madsen testified that he sailed for deeper waters intending to commit suicide, but instead buried Wall at sea. The Local reports that Danish prosecutors are asking that Madsen remain in custody.

"– It's been 75 years since Gone With the Wind was released—and given the many hurdles to its production, it's kind of amazing that it ever was. In Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nashawaty tells the story of the film's making, which centered on producer David Selznick. He was at first reluctant to make the film, despite a glowing review of the book by one of his employees. ""I am absolutely off my nut about this book,"" Katharine Brown wrote, finally convincing him to take action. But plenty got in the way. Among the challenges: The first writer dropped out after spending months on the script. After a number of other writers tried their hand, including Selznick himself, writer Ben Hecht took it on, but there was no time for him to read Margaret Mitchell's book. So Selznick and director Victor Fleming ""stayed up all night acting out the story for him."" Clark Gable was under contract to Selznick's father-in-law, who finally ""loaned"" him to Selznick, with plenty of strings attached—and Gable wasn't thrilled about it. Original director George Cukor didn't get along with Gable and was eventually replaced by Fleming, who didn't get along with Vivien Leigh. ""Leigh hated Fleming. With a passion. Fleming hated her. Clark Gable hated David … Everybody hated David,"" an assistant said. Fleming quit before returning. Ultimately, the film required ""125 days of photography, 37 months of preparation, half a million feet of film and a budget of $4.25 million (at a time when the average feature cost less than $1 million),"" Nashawaty writes. And the trouble was far from over: Racism plagued the various premieres, with black cast members in many cases banned from attending, the Los Angeles Times reports. That prompted anger from Selznick, the AP reports; Gable, meanwhile, had already stood against segregated toilets on set, threatening to bail on the film, according to a Life magazine book cited by the Times. Ultimately, however, ""Selznick kept that film together,"" says a film scholar, and it still holds the record for domestic box-office gross, adjusted for inflation, the Times notes (and you can bet it's a lot better than the current crop of big-grossing films).","['Despite criticism and controversy over the film\'s racial stereotypes — the slaves in the film are happy, and McDaniel\'s Mammy is a

"– Live long and copyright many things. Thus Paramount Pictures hopes to prosper as it wages a legal battle with the makers of popular Kickstarter crowdfunded Star Trek fan film Prelude to Axanar. Paramount claims the film's use of the fictional language Klingon adds up to copyright infringement; the filmmakers contend that attempting to copyright Klingon is absurd given the language is an ""idea or a system."" For legal precedent, they cite the system of bookkeeping: ""Although copyright protects the author’s expression of the system, it does not prevent others from using the system."" But there's doesn't appear to be a quick and easy answer. The US Copyright Office doesn't specifically ""deal with the copyrightability of constructed or fictional languages, let alone Klingon,"" observes Consumerist, which was unable to dig up much in the way of case law on the matter. Paramount, which claims exclusive ownership over many Star Trek features, including characters, themes, plots, dialogue, settings, props, character makeup, costumes, sets, fictional language, and so forth, has responded to the filmmakers' plea by noting that ""a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no Klingons with whom to communicate,"" reports TorrentFreak. By allowing the characters in Prelude to speak Klingon, they assert, the film is infringing on Paramount's characters because speaking the language ""is an aspect of their characters."" The jury's still out, but Boing Boing goes so far as to call this Paramount's attempt to ""kill"" the film, and it frames Paramount's claims as ""dubious,"" in part because it borrows phonemes (from Hindi, Arabic, etc.) as well as grammar (from Japanese, Turkish, etc.)—not to mention it's spoken by many fans around the world.

"– Monkeys at a British zoo have developed a way of saying ""leave me alone"" that doesn't involve biting or flinging poop. The mandrills cover their eyes—much like in the ""see no evil"" gesture—when they desire solitude, and their fellow monkeys respect the signal, the Telegraph reports. Researchers believe that a member of the group invented the sign and other monkeys picked it up in a never-before-witnessed example of monkeys creating sign language within their own community. The researcher who observed the phenomenon says he has been observing mandrills for years and never seen the gesture used anywhere else. Further research is likely to turn up more monkey gestures invented for cultural reasons, suggesting that ""the capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have existed a long time before humans came on the scene,"" he tells Scientific American.","['If gesturing is per\xadformed more broadly among primates than previously thought, Laidre says, “the capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have existed a long time before humans came on the scene', 'It is also unlikely that human activity influenced the mandrills because monkeys—in contrast to apes, dolphins and dogs—do not mimic human behavior, Laidre says', 'The Colchester Zoo in England is home to a community of mandrills, the largest of the monkeys', 'As re\xadported in PLoS ONE in February, he found that mandrills performing the eye-covering gesture were approached and touched by other mandrills significantly less than when they were not using the gesture', 'Laidre and other researchers studying mandrills have not seen the eye-covering gesture in other populations, indicating it is a local phenomenon']"
"– Pole vaulting can be an extremely dangerous sport, as a March Vice article made clear. How it summed the potential for catastrophe: ""At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands."" Such catastrophe struck on Thursday: During a practice jump that her manager described as routine, Austria's champion female pole vaulter landed just off the mat on her head and neck. The accident, which the Sydney Morning Herald reports was witnessed by her parents, left Kira Grunberg a paraplegic. The Austrian athletics federation said in a joint statement with the University Clinic in Innsbruck on Friday that the 21-year-old suffered ""a fracture of the cervical vertebrae of the spine"" and underwent ""emergency surgery to stabilize her spine."" The statement puts it plainly: ""At the moment, the continuation of her sporting career is not an option."" In a post to her Facebook page, Grunberg's family notes the ""tragic accident"" didn't just end her career but also means a ""new life"" and ""long and difficult"" path for her. NPR reports she is now breathing on her own, and describes Europe's sporting world as in shock but rallying to support Grunberg financially.

The four originals, marking 50 years as a band, will be joined by Trey Anastasio of Phish, Bruce Hornsby, and Jeff Chimenti of Ratdog. Anastasio reflects to Billboard: ""I've realized that it's no coincidence that they named their best album ever American Beauty,"" he says. ""They really embodied the American concept of freedom, rolling around the country with a ginormous gang of people and the mindset that 'you can come if you want, you can leave if you want.

"– Things to look forward to in 2011: all-natural Frito-Lay chips, a bunch of truly unnecessary movie sequels, and … the world’s 7 billionth living person. That lucky baby will arrive sometime next year, according to the UN Population Reference Bureau, writes Bryan Walsh for Time. The world’s 6 billionth living person was born just 11 years ago in Bosnia, and the population is expected to exceed 9 billion by the middle of the century. Can the planet really handle that? Robert Kunzig attempts to take on that question in a very lengthy National Geographic cover story (worth a read). Walsh picks out a few highlights: Kunzig calls out attention to the fact that it took nearly all of human history to get us to the 1 billion mark, but we're set to explode from 3 billion to 7 billion in about 50 years. By 2050, we'll be somewhere between 8 billion and 10.5 billion, according to the UN. Space isn't the issue. Kunzig notes that if 9 billion people were spread throughout Earth's habitable regions, the population density would be half of that in France. The potential problems: Not enough food, water, energy. And a lot of aging people. Writes Kunzig, ""Fixating on population numbers is not the best way to confront the future. The number of people does matter, of course. But how people consume resources matters a lot more ...

"– A team sets out to explore a mysterious island in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and soon discovers the fist of a massive monkey in Kong: Skull Island. It might be a familiar story, but critics are mostly applauding Jordan Vogt-Roberts' telling. Here's what they’re saying: Richard Roeper calls it a ""wildly entertaining"" B-movie with an A-list cast. Among its best qualities are ""remarkable visuals"" and ""perfectly timed moments of comedic relief,"" he writes at the Chicago Sun-Times. For those who want it, there's ""shocking violence,"" too, yet the film also ""has a sense of humor about itself,"" Roeper says. ""It's great stuff."" For a film that takes inspiration from Apocalypse Now, Kong: Skull Island is ""surprisingly fun and fresh,"" writes Katie Walsh at the Tribune News Service.

Thank goodness for John C. Reilly ""stealing every scene,"" he adds. ""You'd say he was the comic relief, except Kong: Skull Island can't seem to manage seriousness in the first place.

"– At least 144 people were killed yesterday in the latest Syrian violence, including some 64 slaughtered in a ""horrifying massacre"" at a single checkpoint in Homs province, according to witnesses. But the government has no plans to end its attacks on citizens. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem vowed to ""defend"" his country. ""We are not happy to see brothers killing each other,"" he said. ""This is our country. But we will defend our sovereignty and independence,"" he told reporters. The scores killed at the checkpoint were attempting to flee shelling in the city of Homs. Security forces and thugs kidnapped the women among them, and killed the men, sources told CNN. They were either shot or stabbed to death. The killings occurred as Syrian officials announced that the nation's new draft constitution was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and the European Union imposed new sanctions. US officials dismiss the constitution vote ""as absolutely cynical,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. What Basahr al-Assad has done ""is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control.""

"– A Canadian politician is on a crusade to change the lyrics of O Canada—the Canadian national anthem—to give equal shrift to both genders, the Guardian reports. The third line of O Canada currently reads ""True patriot love in all thy sons command."" A bill introduced by liberal member of parliament Mauril Bélanger this week would change that to ""in all of us command."" ""I want to pay tribute to all the women who have worked and fought to build and shape the Canada that we know today,” Bélanger says in a statement. “I want to at long last honor their sacrifices and contribution.” Who could oppose that?

""This is our national anthem, this is something that we've had for decades,"" Vecchio tells CBC. O Canada was composed in 1880 with French lyrics that didn't mention ""thy sons,"" the Toronto Sun reports. When English speakers finally started singing it around 1900, the most common lyrics were ""thou dost in us,"" highly similar to the proposed change. According to the Guardian, the lyrics weren't changed to ""thy sons"" until 1914. And other lyrics were changed to make them less repetitive when O Canada became the national anthem in 1980, the Sun reports. There have been 10 failed attempts to change ""thy sons"" since 1980. Bélanger himself introduced the same bill only to have it fail last April.

"– In 2011, Anne Ziegenhorn of Florida began to gain weight inexplicably. Normally healthy, the mother of two soon began suffering from burning pain, vision loss, and cloudy thinking and had sores all over her body. She writes that she was unable to talk for 8 months, instead texting and writing on a dry-erase board. She saw many doctors, certain that their diagnoses of lupus, arthritis, and thyroid problems must be wrong. Then she saw Dr. Susan Kolb, author of The Naked Truth About Breast Implants, who has implants herself and who suggested mold might be an issue. Sure enough, as soon as Ziegenhorn's saline breast implants were removed, her symptoms vanished. Wear TV reports Ziegenhorn keeps a video on her phone that shows what was once in her body: a mold-covered implant. (She believes her implant was leaking ""moldy fluid"" into her system for years.) She and another woman from Kentucky, Paula Blade, have teamed up to spread the word, reports WPSD Local 6. Blade's tale is a similar one, and she says that when her removed implants were tested, the implants' valve was found to be faulty, the ""filling fluid [was] grossly contaminated,"" and there were signs of mold. Dr. Kolb believes the mold can often be traced to defective valves (saline implants are put into the body deflated, and the saline is then inserted via the valve). While an FDA spokesman tells Wear TV that he's not aware of similar complaints being filed by women with moldy implants, he does note that most women will eventually need theirs replaced. Dr. Kolb, however, says she's treated thousands of patients with ""saline biotoxin illness"" and feels strongly that patients should have them changed every eight to 15 years.

"– Could ethanol someday essentially be produced out of thin air? A group of scientists has published research in Nature detailing a new method of making ethanol out of carbon monoxide gas, instead of corn or sugarcane, Reuters reports. Researchers saturated water with the gas, then zapped it with a novel device featuring two electrodes, one made of what they're calling ""oxide-derived copper,"" to convert it into fuel. ""I emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today,"" lead researcher Matthew Kanan says. He expects to have a prototype device ready in two to three years. The environmental implications are profound. Critics of ethanol say it drives up food prices and consumes loads of land and water. It can take more than 800 gallons of water to grow enough corn to make 3 gallons of ethanol, Phys.org points out. What's more, researchers envision a two-step process in which the carbon monoxide is derived from carbon dioxide in the air, providing an ""economic incentive"" for scrubbing carbon from the atmosphere, the MIT Technology Review reports. The new process could also work on a far smaller scale than biomass methods; the Review envisions rooftop solar panels generating fuel that's kept in water heater-sized tanks.

Consumerist: ""What in holy heck is the McRibster and why can't we get one here?"" It sounds ""even less rib-like than the McRib. At least that has barbecue sauce."" Burger Business: ""It looks good but it looks more like a pork tenderloin sandwich with its breaded and fried pork patty than like a McRib with its fabulous greasiness."" In case you're wondering what that ""rib"" meat really is, according to the official website and Google Translate, it's pork and ham. Can't make it to Austria in time?

"– Almost exactly a year ago, in July 2016, a ""playful"" family video and a handful of private nude images shared between husband and wife were posted online by an anonymous user who encouraged people to distribute them widely, per Politico. But the content wasn't about just anybody, it featured a House of Representatives member—and her staffers may have been behind it. This week, two former staff members of Virgin Islands Del. Stacey Plaskett (D) were charged in the circulation of the private material, reports the Washington Post. Juan McCullum was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of cyberstalking, and Dorene Browne-Louis was indicted on two counts of obstruction of justice. NBC News reports that McCullum has yet to appear in court, while Browne-Louis has pleaded not guilty. Though she was named only by her initials in the court documents, Plaskett confirmed her identity and said in a statement that her privacy was invaded last year, ""followed by an organized smear campaign,"" just before election time. She says she and her family ""continue to be saddened by the damage we suffered as a result of those egregious acts."" The indictment alleges that McCullum accessed private content after offering to take a House member's malfunctioning iPhone (Plaskett's phone, per NBC) to a local Apple store to be repaired. He left Plaskett's staff in June, shortly before the images were posted under a fake name online. Plaskett, who was re-elected with 85% of the vote, made news this week when she wrote in the Hill about the ""eerily similar"" status of the Virgin Islands to the original 13 colonies, calling it an ""ironic state of freedom without democracy.""","['Last week on July 4 we commemorated the Declaration of Independence, the affirmative document outlining the ideals of equality and democracy and upheld as a model around the world', 'It marks 100 years that the people of the Virgin Islands have been part of the United States and have the honor to be part of Fourth of July celebrations', 'Disenfranchisement in territories was originally a temporary step on the path toward statehood, but it has become a means to maintain the doctrine established by the Plessy v', 'In July 2016, when the personal images appeared on the Internet, Plaskett condemned the public unauthorized distribution of private photographs she had shared with her husband, Jonathan Buckney-Small, and the posting of a “playful video of our family,” that included one of their children', 'This article tagged under: Congress Two former staff members have been charged in the circulation of nude images and video of an elected representative to Congress and her husband, federal prosecutors and the U', 'How can we herald the actions of our Founding Fathers while simultaneously depriving fellow Americans of the same rights those Founding Fathers fought so hard to achieve?

"– A 29-year-old woman met a boy 15 years her junior at a Denver park and started a sexual relationship with him resulting in two children, prosecutors say. Authorities allege Alicia Hernandez, now 33, first met the boy in 2011 or 2012—when he was just 14, though he claims he told Hernandez he was 18, per KMGH. He told authorities the pair began having sex about a year later, per WXIA, though their relationship was only reported to police earlier this month. It isn't clear when Hernandez learned the boy had lied about his age. Hernandez—who gave birth in June 2013 and January 2015—is now charged with sexual assault on a child, a felony, and sexual assault with a 10-year age difference, a misdemeanor. She is out of jail on a $50,000 bond and is due back in court on Oct. 18. In a separate case out of Denver, authorities say Alexandra Kuisis, 41, is charged with sexual assault on a child after she befriended a family and assaulted their 8-year-old daughter, who recently spoke out, reports the Denver Post.

"– Authorities say a 27-year-old Florida man was charged with multiple drug store robberies this week after his mom recognized him on the news, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. According to CBS Miami, police were looking for a man responsible for robbing four Walgreens locations between June 11 and June 25. The suspect would act like he was going to pay for an item, then punch or push the cashier when they opened the cash register, grabbing cash and running off. The Broward County Sheriff's Office released surveillance footage from the robberies, and the mother of Keith Knowles Jr. saw the videos on the news. She confronted her son, who she believed was the man in the footage, and authorities say he confessed to her before turning himself in Sunday. Knowles has been charged with four counts of robbery, one count of theft, and one count of battery on a person over 65. Authorities believe he may be responsible for two additional robberies as well.","['Knowles reportedly struck first when he hit a Walgreens in the city of Plantation on June 11th, according to the sheriff’s office', 'Once the employee opened the cashier register drawer, Knowles pushed the cashier aside, reached over the counter and quickly grabbed handfuls of cash out of the till, according to the sherff’s office', 'in Oakland Park and he capped his crime spree on June 25 by robbing the Walgreens at 3914 W', "", 27, turned himself in to Fort Lauderdale police and was booked into jail Sunday after Broward Sheriff's detectives circulated security camera video from four Walgreens stores that were robbed in June, according to the arrest report filed in the case"", 'Investigators said Knowles used the same tried-and-true method when he robbed another Walgreens at 3100 N', 'Knowles told investigators that his mother showed him news reports that included surveillance videos of the robberies and he admitted that he was the person in all the videos, detectives said', 'When the clerks opened the cash registers, Knowles would punch or push them aside, reach over the counter and quickly grab handfuls of cash out of the drawers before running out of the store, the videos showed', 'On June 25, Knowles reportedly targeted the Walgreens at 3914 W', 'He would appear to be a customer selecting an item off the shelf and then walk up to the cashier as if to pay', 'Security cameras recorded Knowles robbing a Walgreens in Plantation on June 11, and a second Walgreens on June 21 at 3099 N']"
"– ""Our top-line growth ... was below our expectations primarily due to the slower than expected transition to the Keurig 2.0 system,"" Keurig Green Mountain Inc. CEO Brian Kelley explained in an earnings call yesterday, per the Wall Street Journal. Seeking Alpha sees it as the anti-iPhone scenario: ""People are happy with the original and aren't interested for the most part in fixing what isn't broken."" But at the Washington Post, Fred Barbash lays out a different problem: the ""My K-Cup"" one. The coffee packaged into each K-Cup costs customers dearly: on a per pound basis, they spend up to $60, or roughly five times what they'd pay for a bag of Starbucks coffee. Enter the My K-Cup, a refillable option that freed consumers from the expense and brand limitations of Keurig's K-Cups. The problem? The K-Cups that worked in previous models (both those made by Keurig and its competitors) lack a special ink introduced for the 2.0. Those cups no longer work, and neither do My K-Cups; no new refillable option was introduced. The complaints came in short order. As a one-star Amazon review for the K550 2.0 puts it, ""If you want a machine that brews a good cup of coffee then this will work for you. If you want a machine that puts all sorts of restrictions on what type of k-cups you can use this is also the machine for you."" The Post reports the company's initial line of defense was that the move was born out of safety, as the machine wouldn't know how to properly brew a coffee Keurig didn't package. Other companies introduced hacks (one competitor mailed out a free override device), and yesterday, Kelley ""capitulated,"" as Barbash puts it, saying ""we heard loud and clear from consumers""; the My K-Cup will return. (Here's why the inventor of K-Cups doesn't use them.)","['Clever competitors moved quickly to fill the void, with ways to, in effect, hack into the Keurig technology', ""0 isn't the iPhone"", ""The challenge is, in my opinion, that people are happy with the original and aren't interested for the most part in fixing what isn't broken"", 'Worse for Keurig, as executives acknowledged Wednesday during its quarterly earnings briefing, sales of Keurig machines tanked and they began to accumulate on the shelves across the country', 'Once a consumer buys the coffee machine, the coffee drinker may spend as much as $50 to $60 per pound on the coffee contained in the K-Cups, considerably more than the cost of even Starbucks’s breakfast blend, which goes for about $11', 'Green Mountain Roasters President and CEO Brian Kelley, center left, and Senior Vice President Mark Wood cut the ribbon to open the company’s first Keurig retail store in Burlington, Mass', 'The overwhelming majority of sales are for pods as opposed to brewers, kind of like razor blades versus razors, but brewer sales and usage will ultimately lead the long term', 'The company said the change was for the consumer’s own good', 'Maybe the upcoming Kold system, which is a whole different story making a whole different type of drink, will get GMCR back in hyper-growth mode, but I see the general coffee brew continuing in deceleration mode for the foreseeable future', 'Not only was it cheaper, but the coffee drinker had more choice, as “My K-Cup” could be filled with any brand of coffee off the shelf', ""All things considered, the quarter wasn't bad on the face of it"", ""However, I don't think that's the only problem or there would have been better sales for the older unit instead of the huge decline"", '0” line of coffeemakers, it stopped making “My K-Cup” for it and made the machine incompatible with any K-cups already in existence, as well as with any unlicensed disposable K-cups made by other companies', 'We underestimated the passion the consumer had for this', 'Something else is going on and I suspect it is GMCR being closer to market saturation for the brewers', 'Some years back, thousands of Keurig single-serve machine fans found a cheaper alternative, however — refillable, non-disposable K-cups, little plastic coffee grounds holders, which the company graciously sold under the brand of “My K-Cup', 'This borders on the unethical forcing people to buy only the K-cups you make', 'And you owe me $50 for the coffee!”', '“The My K-Cup accessory and other reusable filters are not compatible with Keurig 2', 'We want consumers to be able to bring any brand and bringing the My Cup back allows that', '0 Brewing Technology,” the company explained on Facebook, “because the brewer has no way of determining what beverage is being used or how much coffee is being added, and therefore cannot adjust to factors such as brew strength and amount of water, which could represent a safety concern…”', 'Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours', 'It wasn’t used a lot, but for the consumer it was a nice element to have if they were given coffee as a gift', 'Q4 is obviously the best seasonal period for selling brewers (mostly as gifts) yet the quarter ended with an obscenely high unsold finished goods inventory of brewers']"

"– ""The dog ate my eyeliner"" was apparently enough for YouTube's Rclbeauty101 to bust open a box of colored art pencils and improvise—in a video that's currently sitting at 1.6 million views—and she's not the only one. DIYers are posting online beauty tutorials subbing in colored pencils (softened in warm water first) for eyeliner, UPI reports, while Metro adds that others are melting brilliantly hued crayons to create homemade lipstick. But one company you might think would love the publicity is instead issuing a warning. Crayola has put out a statement on its website saying its products ""are not designed, tested, or approved for this purpose"" and that customers shouldn't be smearing them all over their faces in the name of beauty. Rclbeauty101 points out Crayola makes prominent on its packaging that its products are ""nontoxic."" ""Companies literally make it so that little kids can eat it and be fine,"" she notes in her video; she even calls a Crayola customer service rep to make sure it's safe for a colored pencil ""to touch your skin."" In its statement, however, Crayola stresses, ""Although our products are nontoxic, we do not recommend using them to make lipstick, eyeliner, or other make-up and strongly discourage their use in this manner."" But even Crayola's warning may not scare the masses—which isn't entirely novel, according to at least one DIYer on Twitter, as noted by KMSP: ""Nothing new here, I was doing it in the early 80's when my parents wouldn't let me have makeup.""

"– As the nation's capital languished during October's 16-day government shutdown, a nurse in Washington, DC, made a Facebook prediction: “Furlough babies????"" Lo and behold nine months later, reps at Sibley Memorial Hospital, where the nurse works, say there’s been a nearly 33% increase in births over the last month, says the Washington Post, while two other area hospitals report similarly notable jumps. Anecdotal evidence seems to support the timeline, with one FDA analyst recalling the time around her new daughter’s conception as ""all kind of hazy,"" while a Pentagon worker cops to ""celebrating congressional action"" with his wife. Similar booms have been positively correlated with other major events—including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and a series of East Coast hurricane warnings, notes the Post. But not everyone’s convinced: At least three other DC-area hospitals tell the Post they haven’t seen any ""significant"" increase, and a sociologist who spoke with McClatchy DC says that seemingly burgeoning birth rates after such events are ""usually … just romantic hypotheses with nothing to support them.""

"– Northwestern football players aren't just student-athletes—they're employees of the university who have the right to form a union, a federal official ruled today. How big of a deal is today's ruling by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board? ""The stunning decision has the potential to alter dramatically the world of big-time college sports,"" writes Alejandra Cancino in the Chicago Tribune. The AP's Michael Tarm uses similar language, calling it a ""stunning ruling that could revolutionize college sports."" But first things first: The school plans to appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and nothing is expected to change until that decision comes down. Even then, the case could wind up in the Supreme Court. Northwestern's team is the first to seek permission to unionize, and it''s getting help from a players' rights group called the College Athletes Players Association. CAPA, in turn, is getting support from the United Steelworkers union. CAPA's attorneys say that players generate so much money for schools that they are clearly employees, and that they're already getting paid, though not enough, in the form of scholarships. Northwestern's attorneys argued that there's a big distinction between college players and, say, truck drivers, and it called those scholarships not pay but ""grants,"" reports the LA Times. If the NLRB sanctions such unions, expect teams all over to follow suit. Among other things, the unions would likely demand better coverage of medical expenses for current and former players, along with the right to pursue commercial sponsorships.","['In siding with the

District Court Judge Lou Olivera, who runs a special treatment court for troubled veterans in North Carolina, tells ABC 11 that while former Green Beret Sgt Joe Serna had to be held accountable for lying about a urine test, he worried about what effect a night alone in a cell might have on the vet, who served three tours of duty in Afghanistan and suffers from PTSD. ""When Joe first came to turn himself in, he was trembling,"" Olivera, a fellow vet who served in the Gulf War, tells the Fayetteville Observer. ""I decided that I'd spend the night serving with him."" The jailer brought in extra mats so that the judge could sleep on the floor of the one-bunk cell.

"– For the first time since 1996, educators have released major national guidelines for science in schools. The big news this time: They include a call for climate change education, potentially beginning in middle school, the New York Times reports. They also strongly urge schools to teach evolution. The Next Generation Science Standards, as they're known, are the result of collaboration between educators and 26 states. Though states don't have to follow the rules, 26 are ""seriously considering"" them, the Times notes. ""In the current situation the state standards are all over the map. It's a hodgepodge,"" an expert involved says. ""We are still in a situation where across the country, basically in every state, students can still graduate from high school and in some cases go through college without learning the basics."" Still, the completed guidelines are watered down from earlier drafts, the Guardian notes. The amount of material devoted to climate change has been cut by a third, and the final draft isn't as clear on human involvement in climate change: ""It's buried at best,"" says an education

National Research Council the National Science Teachers Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, would defuse any political controversy attached to the teaching of climate change', 'It warned that the standards ignored evidence against evolution, promoted “secular humanism,” and threatened to “take away the right of parents to direct the religious education of their children', 'Mario Molina, deputy director at the Alliance for Climate Education, said the experts drafting the guidelines had cut 35% from the sections devoted to climate change, in response to public comments', 'The organizations included the National Science Teachers Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council and Achieve, a nonprofit education group that helped develop the earlier common standards in mathematics and English', 'Educators want to introduce students to topics that can be made comprehensible only by drawing on the

for the Next Generation Science Standards refused to comment on the new guidelines, and hung up on the phone when asked about climate change', '“Quite simply, students have a right to know about climate science and solutions,” said Sarah Shanley Hope, the executive director of the Alliance for Climate Education, which offers one-day programs in schools', 'to the process', 'McCaffrey said the

impose and raise standards, with a focus on critical thinking and primary investigation', 'The new standards were released at a time when conservative groups in America are making a strong push to limit teaching of established climate science or inject fringe ideas on climate change into the curriculum', 'Many states are expected to adopt the guidelines over the next year or two, but it could be several years before the guidelines are translated into detailed curriculum documents, teachers are trained in the material and standardized tests are revised', 'Financing was provided by private foundations, including the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Noyce Foundation and the Cisco Foundation, as well as DuPont', 'The standards are also much vaguer about the causes of climate change',

hatchery — perhaps repeatedly, over the course of years — to help them learn principles from biology, chemistry and physics', 'Evans, the executive director of the National Science Teachers Association', 'In Britain, meanwhile, draft guidelines released last month cut climate change off the curriculum for children under the age of 14', 'The new guidelines also offered far less time for

"– It was a ""false and unprofessional television attack"" full of ""lies, misrepresentations, distortions, and omissions."" That's how a lawyer for the family of JonBenet Ramsey sums up a ""disgusting and revolting"" CBS documentary and its panel's conclusion that Burke Ramsey likely killed his sister in a rage that was covered up by his parents, John and Patsy. ""I will be filing a lawsuit on behalf of Burke Ramsey,"" the lawyer tells Reuters. He isn't the only one taking issue with the airing, though CBS says it ""stands by the broadcast and will do so in court."" Rolling Stone calls it ""a witch hunt"" and ""cruel ratings ploy""; in its view the evidence was ""almost entirely subjective, at times dangerously misleading and dependent on a flawed police investigation."" The investigators ignored the fact that they reached the same conclusion about Patsy's 911 call—in which they say Burke is heard speaking to his parents—as investigators in 1997, instead presenting their findings as new information. They also focused on what is ""appropriate"" human behavior and language in examining the Ramsey family's actions after the murder, which is rarely allowed in court. A lawyer not involved in the case calls the re-investigation ""a complete travesty,"" per the New Zealand Herald. Investigators ""went into this with an agenda—and that was the killer had to be from the family,"" he says.

"– Colin Kroll, a tech executive who co-founded the HQ Trivia app, has died. He was 35, the AP reports. The New York Police Department says officers went to Kroll's Manhattan apartment early Sunday after getting a call asking for a wellness check on him. They found him unconscious and unresponsive on his bed. He was pronounced dead at the scene. TMZ says he ""died of an apparent drug overdose,"" but the medical examiner's office will determine cause of death. Kroll was the chief executive of the trivia app, which live-streams short trivia shows to users and became popular after its release in 2017. He also was a founder of Vine, which was an app built around six-second videos, and worked for a period at Twitter. But Vine was scuttled four years after Twitter bought it in 2012, and HQ Trivia had fallen in popularity, falling from iTunes' list of 100 free games, per CNN. What's more, Intermedia Labs—a business he co-founded that created HQ Trivia—was said to be in disorder. Kroll recently ousted co-founder Rus Yusupov and engaged in behavior that one source told Re/Code was ""inappropriate and unprofessional.""

"– It's common knowledge that a healthy person shouldn't sit around all day, but new research on running is emphasizing the opposite danger. Running too much can be just as bad for you as being sedentary, the study suggests. Researchers tracked some 1,100 healthy runners and 413 sedentary folks over a period of more than 12 years, HealthDay reports via Medical Xpress. People ranged in age from 20 to 95. The risk of dying during the study turned out to be approximately the same among heavy runners—those who ran quickly more than three days a week for a total of more than four hours—and sedentary people who rarely exercised, Time reports. The best plan, according to the study, was to run lightly: The group that had the best results ran at a slow-ish pace (about 5mph) less than three times each week, going for an hour to 2.4 hours total. Even a group that ran a bit more often and longer saw a slight increase in death risk, Time notes. The findings could perhaps relate to cardiovascular problems previously observed in the most die-hard runners and cyclists. ""If you want to do something good for yourself, you don’t have to be extreme,"" says a study author. But another researcher points to a number of possible flaws in the findings, including the fact that the hardest-running group was quite small. (Another recent study has a warning on exercise: It could hurt your teeth.)","['And according to his results, that sweet spot is closer to the ‘less’ side of the curve than the ‘more’ side', 'But in a report published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology researchers from Denmark say that people who push their bodies too hard may essentially undo the benefit of exercise', '""Basically, the study still shows it\'s a much better option to prescribe some form of running as a part of a healthy lifestyle and that sedentary behavior is not a prescription for long-term health and mortality,"" said Dave Watt, executive director of the American Running Association and the American Medical Athletic Association', 'Listen to the most important stories of the day', 'Americans as a whole don’t exercise enough—at least that’s what the latest studies show—and so the message is clear: get more active, take walks, Let’s Move!

"– Jonathan Martinez, the 8-year-old boy killed in Monday's San Bernardino school shooting, was ""the happiest kid you'll ever meet"" despite the rare genetic condition he suffered from, says teaching assistant Jennifer Downing. Jonathan was born with Williams syndrome, which affects around one in 10,000 people and causes developmental delays as well as heart problems, the AP reports. But the genetic condition, which the boy's family want to raise awareness of, also makes children friendly and sociable, qualities Jonathan was known and loved for at North Park Elementary, the San Bernardino Sun reports. Downing says Jonathan, who had already undergone heart surgery once, was also the best reader in the class. Jonathan was killed in his special-needs classroom when Cedric Anderson opened fire on his estranged wife, teacher Karen Smith.

"– Machine guns and explosions were audible as violence overtook a high-security section of Damascus last night, killing at least three and wounding 18 Syrian troops.

"– Nevada on July 1 became the fifth state to sell recreational marijuana to the public, and one week later, it declared an emergency. But the chaos is on the licensing side of things. The new law allows those 21 and up to buy up to an ounce of pot from what are 47 licensed dispensaries, reports the AP. The problem, explains Vice News, is that the only way for dispensaries to legally get pot for the next 18 months is via wholesale liquor distributors, who secured the exclusive right via a November ballot measure. But of the seven liquor distributors to have applied for a license to restock dispensaries, zero have ""met the application requirements."" That's where the statement of emergency, signed Friday by Gov. Brian Sandoval, comes in. It says the emergency regulation is needed to allow the Department of Taxation to figure out whether limiting licenses to liquor dealers will result in an insufficient number of pot distributors in the state. This is a real concern, because without pot sales, ""the State will not realize the revenue on which the State budget relies."" Indeed, the Las Vegas Sun reports the first four days of sales brought in $500,000 in tax revenue, with the six-month tax estimate set at $30 million. The whole thing has been a bit of a saga: In mid-June, liquor distributors won a preliminary injunction banning the state from handing out licenses to other entities, Reason notes. As for how pot sales have happened to date, dispensaries were able to stock up pre-July 1.

"– Silvio Berlusconi squeaked through a confidence vote in the Italian parliament today, but the agonizingly close 316-301 vote didn’t exactly inspire, well, confidence. Berlusconi’s majority is so slim that it effectively cannot pass legislation, the New York Times reports, and analysts say that the slightest bump in the road could break the fragile coalition entirely. Berlusconi called the vote himself after failing a routine vote this week and refusing calls to step down. Berlusconi survived thanks to loyalists afraid his government would be replaced by a non-political technocratic one seeking structural changes to Italy’s economy—a government they’d have no place in. Of course, many business leaders were hoping for exactly that. “The best signal that Italy could have sent to the markets would have been to boot Mr. Berlusconi out, but it has failed to do so,” one economic think tank director tells the AP. Opponents, meanwhile, complained that Berlusconi can win confidence votes, but cannot govern. “He only knows how to stay stuck in his seat using tricks,” one opposition leader complained.","['In the statement, President Giorgio Napolitano said the prime minister had to show the “necessary cohesion” to tackle Italy’s budget deficits and to propose “adequate solutions to the urgent problems of the country, including in meeting its European obligations', 'Had he lost the vote of confidence, Berlusconi would have been forced to resign _ about 1 1/2 years before the end of his term, in 2013', 'He said the vote Friday amounted to an ""ambush"" by the opposition, and moments after the vote, he spoke to reporters about his plan to spur the country\'s moribund economy', '“In this interminable twilight, the man who was Berlusconi remains true to his salesman’s essence,” the satirist and political commentator Massimo Gramellini wrote recently in the Turin daily La Stampa', 'Berlusconi would have had to resign, marking the end of an 18-year political era in which the billionaire businessman shaped Italian politics in his own image, entwining the country’s fate with his own', 'In what the daily Corriere della Sera called “an atmosphere of interminable agony,” analysts said the Berlusconi government was now hanging by a thread and could fall at the next bump in the road — when enough disgruntled lawmakers from within Mr', ""After days of tension, the premier's allies clapped when the result of the vote was announced"", '""The best signal that Italy could have sent to the markets would have been to boot Mr', 'Berlusconi was saved by loyalists who prefer to have the government limp along rather than fall and potentially be replaced by a group of nonpolitical technocrats with a mandate to carry out the structural changes including tax increases, changes to the pension system and a growth stimulus bill now deadlocked in Parliament', 'But the bank did this in exchange for promised structural changes that the government has not yet carried out, a mix of tax increases and changes to the pension system', '“This government will die from confidence,” the leader of the center-left opposition, Pierluigi Bersani, said after Friday’s vote, the ANSA news agency reported', '1, urged the government to act more quickly to implement reforms that can spur growth _ beyond the austerity package that put Italy on the path to balance its budget by 2013', 'Otherwise, Draghi warned that the rising cost of borrowing to service national debt seen over the last three months will eat up ""no small part"" of the austerity package approved by Parliament last month', 'Berlusconi faced a confidence vote in Parliament Friday that is seen as the most serious threat to his', 'Addressing lawmakers on Thursday, the prime minister said he was the only “credible alternative” able to govern Italy through the economic crisis, and refused to step down', '""The goal of relaunching growth is finally largely shared, but the adoption of the measures necessary so far have banged up against apparently insurmountable difficulties,"" Draghi said', 'Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi raises his hand as he sits in the lower chamber of parliament to attend a confidence vote, in Rome, Friday, Oct', 'The results of Friday’s vote promise to make that even more difficult', 'Friday’s vote made clear that Italy had been living with the shadow of Mr', 'The 75-year-old leader has steadfastly hung onto power despite the scandals and four criminal trials in Milan', 'Berlusconi has proven to be a tough outlier — not least because the European Central Bank in August agreed to buy Italian debt']"
"– The chances of life existing on Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa—and of Earthlings being able to find it—are looking a lot stronger, NASA scientists say. A vast ocean is believed to lie beneath as much as 20 miles of ice on Europa, but new research suggests that huge lakes exist a lot closer to the surface. A suspected interchange of water between the lakes and the ocean means that nutrients could be transferred from near the surface to life far below, the BBC reports. The research team examined bumps known as ""chaos terrain"" on Europa's surface and developed models based on the way ice moves around on Earth. If the researchers are right, ""you've moved from a system that checks one of the requirements for life to a system that checks two requirements for life,"" an astrobiologist tells the Christian Science Monitor. The only way to confirm the findings would be to send a spacecraft to Europa to investigate.

"– Fashion designer and icon Oscar de la Renta died yesterday at 82, after a yearslong battle with cancer, the New York Times reports. His illness, the paper notes, didn't slow him down: He designed Amal Alamuddin's dress for her wedding to George Clooney just last month, and his business expanded by 50% in the eight years he faced the disease. The Dominican Republic-born designer's clientele ranged from first ladies—including Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, and Michelle Obama, Vanity Fair reports—to Oscar winners. ""You want to know who my customer is?” he once asked. ""All the women who can afford to buy my clothes!"" He began work in fashion design in the 1950s in Spain, when the wife of the then-US ambassador saw his drawings and sought a dress for her daughter. His career moved him to Paris and eventually the US in 1963. By the 1970s, de la Renta and his first wife, Françoise de Langlade, were ""the Social Lions of New York,"" André Leon Talley writes in Vogue. The Times notes that the couple were central to the rise of designers as the social elite. But de la Renta didn't see his work as particularly ""heavy.

"– The Bible suggests the Canaanites were wiped out by the ancient Israelites, but a new study says otherwise, claiming the people survived and went on to be the ancestors of those who today live in Lebanon, ScienceDaily reports. Per a study in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers from the UK's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute sequenced the genomes of five 4,000-year-old Canaanites, as well as 99 people now residing in Lebanon—DNA evidence that enabled the scientists to establish ancestry. The study results show an overwhelming majority of the genetic makeup (93%) of today's Lebanese can be traced back to the Canaanites, per the Times of Israel. Study co-author Chris Tyler-Smith calls that percentage ""quite surprising,"" given the ""enormously complex history of this region,"" per ScienceDaily. The Bible's Book of Deuteronomy lays out what was to happen to the Canaanites: ""Completely destroy them ... as the Lord your God has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do."" But some Bible verses contradict the story of total annihilation, and the researchers write that ""no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages."" The Canaanites made a major cultural impact during the Bronze Age, including introducing what's believed to have been the first alphabet.

"– In the 1960s, 94% of parents used physical punishment on their children. In 2010, just 22% of parents did. Parents have figured out that there's a better way than spanking—and now it's time for yelling to experience that same reckoning. Most parents today yell at their kids, and in the New York Times, Stephen Marche calls the practice ""the most widespread parental stupidity around today."" Studies have found that shouting at kids can lead to increases in anxiety, stress, depression, and behavioral problems and decreases in self-esteem. It makes parents look out of control and weak, and all it accomplishes is teaching kids to yell themselves. ""Yelling, even more than spanking, is the response of a person who doesn’t know what else to do,"" Marche writes—before explaining what else you can do. He highlights the ABCs of parenting, a process that does require advance planning: A: antecedents. Instead of yelling at your children every time they leave their shoes strewn around the room, clearly explain to them what you want them to do—before you want them to do it. In this case, talk to them in the morning about putting their shoes away when they come home from school. B: behaviors. Define, shape, and model the behavior you want. Put your own shoes away, and help your kids understand what to do. C: consequences. When your child puts his or her shoes away, or even gets them closer to where they're supposed to go, go over-the-top with praise, both verbal and nonverbal (touching).

"– She's almost there. Opal Lee, 90, set out from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, in September with a single goal: a long walk, with a final stop in Washington, DC, where she wants to present her petition to President Obama calling for a federal holiday on June 19. That's the day—""Juneteenth""—that Union soldiers came to Texas in 1865 with the news that slavery had been abolished more than two years earlier. What started out as a stroll around Lee's church last August mushroomed into something bigger. ""The people walked with me, and we've been going ever since,"" Lee tells NPR. ""I just thought if a little, old lady in tennis shoes was out there walking, somebody would take notice."" She was right. Invitations started coming, and Lee was happy to take them—in states ranging from Colorado and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Virginia, in a quest to add 100,000 signatures to her petition. ""I walk wherever I’m invited,"" Lee told CBS Pittsburgh during a stop in November. ""Two and a half miles in the morning and two and a half in the afternoon to symbolize that slaves were later told that they were free."" Lee, who collects donations on GoFundMe, is due in the nation's capital next week, where she hopes to make her case to Obama and lawmakers. Although 45 states count Juneteenth as a holiday, Lee says federal recognition is important. ""It would be the oldest holiday of significance for black people in these United States, so it needs to be observed and celebrated,"" she tells Fox4. ""Slaves didn't free themselves,"" she adds, per NPR. ""There were abolitionists and people of all persuasions that worked untiringly to have slavery abolished.""

"– The founder of a neo-Nazi blog and major figure in the alt-right movement has resigned after he was revealed to have a Jewish wife. A post published on Medium over the weekend claimed Mike Enoch of The Right Stuff—whose Daily Shoah podcast has 100,000 subscribers—is actually Mike Peinovich, a New York City web developer with a ""liberal family"" and a Jewish wife. Peinovich, who often discussed killing Jewish people, denied the report to Salon before confirming it on the TRS forum. He then resigned. As several others involved in TRS were outed recently, Mic reports its future is now unclear, though National Policy Institute head Richard Spencer says Peinovich ""will continue to be a force on the alt-right in the future,"" per the Guardian. The revelation came less than a month after a former alt-right vlogger described a major alt-right player as ""married to a Jewish woman,"" without naming names. Peinovich's wife appeared on the Daily Shoah podcast numerous times. In one 2015 episode, she read a neo-Nazi parody of The Night Before Christmas of which she was ""very proud,"" Peinovich said at the time. If her Jewish heritage ""makes you want to leave the movement, or to have nothing to do with TRS, then I understand,"" Peinovich wrote on the TRS forum this week. The response from the movement was less than understanding, with one user suggesting the pair were ""actors in the same play being orchestrated by the Jews,"" while other memes showed Peinovich and his wife in gas chambers.","[""Peinovich was also one of the most prominent organizers of the alt-right, the loosely affiliated online network of white nationalist and far-right activists who sprung

"– It's long been thought that napping is an important part of a baby's growth—both physically and mentally. Now new research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that naps help babies form new memories, and that when a nap directly follows a new activity the baby is far likelier to recall it the next day than if that child doesn't nap until four hours after the activity, reports the Los Angeles Times. ""In both of our experiments, only those infants who took an extended nap for at least half an hour within four hours after learning remembered the information,"" the study's lead author tells HealthDay News. To test a baby's recall, researchers studied 216 babies ages 6 months and 12 months. They demonstrated how to remove mittens from animal puppets, and found that those who then took naps at least 30 minutes long (and typically more like 80) were better able to recall how to remove the mittens 24 hours later than those who didn't nap until four hours later. Whether a baby napped just before the experiment made no difference. The authors also hypothesize that because the hippocampal region—key to memory formation—is so small in babies, it may only be able to store smaller chunks of information, hence the need for frequent sleep early in life. (Other research shows a newborn's brain grows 1% a day.)","['Additionally, after the 24-h delay, memory performance of infants in the nap condition was significantly higher than that of infants in the no-nap condition', 'Because most babies at those ages are not yet talking, the researchers had to find a nonverbal way to measure how the timing of sleep influenced the strength of a memory', 'This is the first experimental evidence to our knowledge for an enhancing role of sleep in the consolidation of declarative memories in the first year of life', '""There are many studies in the literature showing the benefit of naps for adults, but adults do not need to nap to retain new memories,"" said Rebecca Gomez, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Arizona', ""The new study is published in this week's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"", '""The small number of studies makes it difficult to make firm recommendations to parents,"" said Angela Lukowski, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine', 'Human infants devote the majority of their time to sleeping', '"" The study doesn\'t definitively confirm that the naps themselves help the memories stick, but the researchers believe that is happening', 'The potential benefits of infant sleep for memory processing are largely unexplored', 'These results suggest that infants rely on frequent naps for the formation of long-term memories']"

"– Mark Lane, ""one of the most important experts on the Kennedy assassination,"" died Tuesday at his his home in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the age of 89, the New York Times reports. Lane came to national prominence with his best-selling 1966 book Rush to Judgment, which questioned the findings of the Warren Commission and concluded a second gunman helped Lee Harvey Oswald assassinate Kennedy. He was the first to use the now well-known phrase ""grassy knoll."" He went on to publish multiple books—and write a number of films—on the Kennedy assassination. “While I don’t agree with his conspiracy theories about President Kennedy’s assassination, he deserves credit for raising important questions,” the director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics tells the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Lane was also a defense lawyer who represented some high-profile clients, including James Earl Ray and cult leader Jim Jones. Even after Ray was convicted of killing Martin Luther King Jr., Lane maintained his innocence and believed another conspiracy could be at play, the New York Daily News reports. Lane was also a civil-rights activist and served one term in the New York State Assembly. “His life was just an absolute testament to what people can become,” his assistant and friend Sue Herndon tells the Times-Dispatch. “He lived more lives than so many people.” Lane passed away one year before all government records of Kennedy's death are set to be made public.","['Almost immediately he began the Citizens’ Committee of Inquiry, interviewed witnesses, collected evidence and delivered speeches on the assassination in the United States and in Europe, where he befriended Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher, who became an early supporter of Mr', 'The Kennedy assassination, one of the manifest turning points of the 20th century, was the pivotal moment in Mr', 'He would go on to raise the possibility of conspiracy in the assassination of the Rev', 'The pivotal conspiracy book was later made into a documentary in 1967, and turned into the film “Executive Action” in 1973', '“The death of James Earl Ray effectively ends any hope that the courts might provide a new trial for him and the truth for the American people,” Lane said in 1998', 'Lane devoted much of the next three decades to its investigation', '“Most of you know him through his work with the Kennedy Assassination, which really was the tip of the iceberg of a lifetime of service to the search for truth', 'He had organized rent strikes, opposed bomb shelter programs, joined the Freedom Riders, took on civil rights cases and was active in the New York City Democratic Party', ""Lane's book sparked theories that JFK was killed as part of a conspiracy — something the House committee on Assassinations admitted was likely true in 1979"", 'Lane was most known for his 1966 bestseller “Rush to Judgment,” which criticized the Warren Commission’s report on the assassination', ""The Commission's report will be completely released to the public in 2017"", 'His book, ""Last Word,"" accused the CIA of plotting the president\'s death', 'Mark Lane, the defense lawyer, social activist and author who concluded in a blockbuster book in the mid-1960s that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have acted alone in killing President John F', 'Lane was still publishing about the JFK assassination conspiracy in 2011', '“He always believed in the power of Americans to understand the problems faced by our country and to stand up to them with their voices and actions,” a tribute posted by Lane’s Facebook page wrote', 'He detailed his experience with the “Peoples Temple” cult leader in his 1980 novel, “The Strongest Poison', ') in front of the House Assassinations Committee in 1978']"
"– Just one alcoholic drink per day—even a teeny one—may not bode well for women on the breast cancer front, reports the Washington Post. That's the conclusion of a large-scale review by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research fund that took a closer look at 119 studies involving more than 12 million women globally, and the impact of nutrition, diet, and physical activity on breast cancer risk. Although a typical alcoholic beverage contains 14 grams of alcohol, the report finds that even a small glass of wine, beer, or spirits (one with as little as 10 grams of alcohol) is tied to a 5% increased cancer risk in pre-menopausal women and 9% in post-menopausal women, indicating there may be ""no level of alcohol use that is completely safe"" when it comes to breast cancer, Ann McTiernan, one of the study's lead authors, tells the Post. Some good news: Researchers also found exercise plays a role in one's risk level—specifically, ""vigorous"" exercise on a regular basis cut the risk of breast cancer for both pre-menopausal women (a 17% reduction) and post-menopausal women (a 10% cut). So what if you like to throw one back but also often hit the gym? McTiernan notes alcohol increases estrogen levels, which has been tied to breast cancer risk, and that exercise can tamp those levels down—though that doesn't necessarily mean it will cancel out alcohol's effects. Although a healthy lifestyle doesn't offer complete assurance that cancer will stay away—McTiernan compares it to wearing a seatbelt, per the Post—the AICR estimates that a third of US breast cancer cases could be avoided if women kept to a healthy weight, exercised regularly, and didn't drink. (Alcohol has been tied to at least half a dozen types of cancer.)","['""But I can\'t say that for someone who drinks five drinks and then runs, that the exercise is going to negate the adverse effects of the alcohol', 'The report, which was issued Tuesday, concluded that drinking the equivalent of one small glass of wine, beer or other alcohol a day — about 10 grams of alcohol — is linked to an increased cancer risk of 5 percent for pre-menopausal women and 9 percent for post-menopausal women', 'Just one glass of wine or other alcoholic drink a day significantly raises the risk of breast cancer, while vigorous exercise such as running and bicycling reduces it, according to an expansive review of research on the effects of diet, nutrition and physical activity on the disease', 'About 252,000 women in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer this year', 'That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved', 'Researchers were not able to calculate the degree to which vigorous exercise might cut the risk of alcohol consumption', ""The researchers noted that many things influence cancer risk and that women can't control factors such as a family history of cancer"", '""This suggests there is no level of alcohol use that is completely safe in terms of breast cancer,"" said Anne McTiernan, a cancer-prevention researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and one of the report\'s lead authors', ""Waiting and watching with 'Stage 0' breast cancer put to nationwide test These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to"", 'The goal is to fix all broken links on the web', 'Pre-menopausal women who were the most active had a 17 percent lower risk of developing malignancies compared to the least active women, while post-menopausal women had a 10 percent decreased risk', 'The report also found limited evidence linking dairy foods, diets high in calcium and foods containing carotenoids to a lower risk of some breast cancers']"
"– Scientists, apparently bored with pert, productive rats, added a little marijuana to the equation and found that, as many a teenager can tell you, laziness ensued. So report researchers at the University of British Columbia in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience after concluding that male lab rats given TCH experience an observable reduction in their ""willingness to exert cognitive effort."" To test this, researchers trained 29 rats to choose whether they wanted to perform a more difficult task to earn a larger quantity of a sugary treat or perform an easier task but earn less of the treat. Without THC, most of the rats preferred to exert themselves for the greater reward; after the dose of THC, however, they largely chose the easier path and settled for a smaller treat, even though their ability to perform the harder task was not impacted. ""What’s particularly interesting is though they were less likely to do these more difficult tasks they were still able to,"" one researcher tells the Guardian, adding that there's a clear need for more research on how THC impacts the human brain, whether any negative side effects can be reduced, and whether marijuana compounds other than THC play a role. When the researchers gave the rats doses of the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol, or CBD, which is thought to have medical benefits such as pain relief and doesn't cause a high, they found that it didn't impact the rats' cognitive behavior, but it also didn't help mitigate the effects of THC on motivation.

"– Charlie Sheen stirred up another controversy while in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night: He somehow managed to snag a police escort so he could book it at 80mph to his show, for which he was running almost an hour late. The Washington Post looks into the matter, but no one will say exactly how such a thing was arranged or who paid for it. A police spokesperson says it's ""under investigation.""

That amount matches the amount his fans donated during an odd and somewhat controversial charity march Sheen staged in support of the group last week in Toronto, during which he sported a hat that said, “I’M NOT BIPOLAR.” A rep for the group calls the hat insulting, but says, “We’re happy to receive the funds.” (Click to read what Sheen announced he'd do if he was elected president.)","['Accompanying the tweet, which appears to have been deleted, was a photo taken in the SUV carrying Sheen, showing the speedometer needle at 80 mph, with the flashing strobe lights of the lead police car visible through the windshield', 'An event organizer is required to sign a letter of agreement beforehand, promising to reimburse the department for the cost of deploying officers', 'For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them)', 'The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites', 'The mystery endures', 'You’ll have to wonder awhile longer: As of Thursday, 48 hours after Sheen had come and gone, no one in his camp or the police department would publicly explain the deployment of law enforcement resources', 'Although the D', '“Citizens of the District don’t want to see their police force used to escort private citizens and that Charlie Sheen, of all people, is getting a personal escort,” said D', 'And a spokeswoman for Constitution Hall said the venerable venue had nothing to do with the actor’s commute', 'The seed list for this crawl was a list of Alexa’s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date', 'The department’s special events branch works on “planning, developing and executing escort and security support,” but only for “distinguished guests of the federal and municipal governments,” the site says', 'The department’s Web site defines a “reimbursable detail” as one in which on-duty officers are posted at public events such as festivals and parades to direct traffic, control crowds and “ensure the safety of public patrons', 'police escort — at least two marked cars with emergency lights blazing — that helped the fired sitcom star and his entourage hurry into the District?', '“[I]n car with Police escort in front and rear!” Sheen, 45, said in a message posted to his Twitter account (@charliesheen) as he and his posse were headed to the city in two SUVs', 'It was still unclear Thursday whether the escort began at the airport in suburban Virginia', 'The phone in the special events branch rang and rang Thursday', '“Constitution Hall operates under a four-wall rental, which means a promoter rents the venue, books the act, and then is responsible for all aspects of the show, including security, ticketing, ushering, etc', '“This means the government was reimbursed for the services provided', 'When Crump was asked how a TV star’s drive into the city from an airport fit the definition of “reimbursable detail,” she would only say that the matter is being investigated', 'On Thursday night, he was set to rant at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta', 'However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it', 'The show, scheduled to start at 8 p', 'based on security needs, and there are protocols to be followed,” the chief said', 'He said the chief was “very clearly caught off-guard” by news of Sheen’s ride', 'Council member Phil Mendelson (D-At Large), chairman of the committee that oversees police', 'An Atlanta police spokesman said the department “has not been asked to provide any escorts', 'The branch is part of the police homeland security bureau, which is commanded by Assistant Chief Lamar Greene', 'We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with']"

"– President Obama's surprise comments yesterday on the George Zimmerman verdict—""Trayvon Martin could have been me""—continue to resonate today. Examples: New York Times editorial: It lavishes high praise on Obama for ""laying bare his personal anguish and experience"" to explain why black Americans were so frustrated by the acquittal. His important, eloquent words went beyond the specifics of the trial and ""crystallized the dissonance around this case."" It's great we have a president who can do that, but it's ""sad that we still need him to do it."" Jonathan Chait, New York: It was ""instantly historic,"" he writes. ""Obama understands that interjecting himself into a racialized controversy carries risks, but he also believes that the electorate of the future is on his side. His remarks are probably aimed not at the present but at posterity."" John Kass, Chicago Tribune: All the people praising the speech are missing something, Kass argues. Obama ""played the race card and they didn't see it coming. He attributed racial motive to a homicide even though the race angle was never established in court."" His ""silky rhetoric"" helped him get away it—the president ""bypassed the evidence and established his own motive. Only a maestro could accomplish this."" Rich Benjamin, Salon: He calls the speech a ""dramatic anti-climax,"" arguing that Obama didn't say anything ""insightful or profound."" But Benjamin, who is black, raised a ruckus when he compared Obama's response unfavorably to Eric Holder's ""trenchant"" remarks. ""Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Nigger. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Nigger?""

"– The judge in the Stanford rape case isn't just facing a petition to get him off the bench—he's become so unpopular that potential jurors are bailing. KPIX reports that on Wednesday, some 20 potential jurors refused to serve on a jury in an unrelated stolen-goods case under Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky. ""I can't believe what you did,"" one woman told Persky, referring to his lenient sentence for Stanford sex attacker Brock Turner, the San Jose Mercury News reports. In other developments: Lawyer Barbara Spector tells the New York Daily News that in a 2011 civil trial over the alleged gang rape of a 17-year-old girl, she felt Persky sided with the group of baseball players accused of raping the girl. Spector says Persky allowed lawyers for the defendants to show Facebook photos of the girl wearing revealing clothing months after the incident because they argued the photos showed she did not have PTSD. Persky has his defenders, who say he is fair-minded and not a man known for issuing harsh sentences—or bowing to public pressure. He has ""a reputation for being a thoughtful jurist and he has been fair and decent to our clients, many of whom come from poor socioeconomic backgrounds,"" a public defender in Santa Clara tells the Guardian. In an open letter to Turner's victim published on BuzzFeed, Joe Biden praises her ""breathtaking"" bravery and ""solid steel spine."" ""Your story has already changed lives,"" he writes. ""You have helped change the culture. You have shaken untold thousands out of the torpor and indifference towards sexual violence that allows this problem to continue."" Rep. Ted Poe, a former prosecutor and judge from Texas, read portions of the victim's searing court statement in the House yesterday and called for voters to recall Persky, the Dallas Morning News reports. ""This judge got it wrong. There is an archaic philosophy in some courts that sin ain't sin as long as good folk do it,"" said Poe, a Republican. ""The judge should be removed. The rapist should do more time for the dastardly deed he did that night.""

"– Osan Air Base may not be a name you're familiar with, but it's a US Air Force base that sits in a prime location: fewer than 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South Korea. If that's not enough to get your attention, this line from NBC News might change that: ""It's a facility so critical that war planners believe it's the North's No. 1 target should hostilities break out,"" and thousands of US military personnel are stationed there. The network reports on its exclusive visit to the base, which is home to the US Air Force's 51st Fighter Wing. There, air crews and patriot missile batteries are at the ready in the event of ballistic missiles or chemical attacks. When North Korea launched four ballistic missiles toward Japan in March, the Washington Post noted the launch site was fewer than 300 miles from the Osan base.

"– The only thing more mysterious than the identity of the couple who stumbled upon an estimated $10 million in US gold coins while walking their dog on their California property: Where did the gold come from? The San Francisco Chronicle floats a theory with all the intrigue and illegality you could hope for: Historian/coin collector/fishing guide Jack Trout provided the paper with a passage from the Bulletin of American Iron and Steel Association that references a $30,000 turn-of-the-century gold heist from the San Francisco Mint that he believes is linked to the coins. Lending credence to the theory: The unearthed 1,427 gold coins, dated 1847 to 1894, were mostly uncirculated and in chronological order, suggesting they hadn't entered the public realm. And though they are worth millions today, their face value is $27,000, which roughly syncs with what was taken from the mint. Trout also points to the buried stash's 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece not emblazoned with ""In God We Trust""; he suspects it was a private coin created by a mint manager that never left the mint. ""For it to show up as part of the treasure find links it directly"" to the mint heist, he says. But the couple's coin broker is no fan of the mint robbery theory, telling the Chronicle he'd expect the haul would have included coins dated closer to the heist date. But a former SF Mint detective sees it as plausible: ""Downstairs, we had vaults where we kept old coins that hadn't been put into circulation."" PJMedia further digs up a 1906 congressional report that indicates mint clerk W.N. Dimmick was convicted of the mint theft, but the document doesn't state whether Dimmick revealed the coins' location, or if they had been recovered. ABC News notes that if the coins are indeed purloined government property, the couple may owe Uncle Sam more than a heck of a lot in taxes: They may have to turn over the entire haul, and get a finder's fee in return.","['In the absence of a contrary statutory provision, the title to treasure trove belongs to the finder against all others with the exception of the true owner', 'The U', 'I was looking down in the right spot and saw the side of the can', 'According to the 1906 edition of the official Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, a mint clerk named W', 'Dimmick was caught and convicted of stealing $30,000 in gold coins from the San Francisco Mint — although in the description of the case no mention is made of whether Dimmick ever revealed the location of the stolen coins, or whether they were ever recovered', 'The finders will EITHER have to hand over all the coins back to the government, OR pay taxes on them (on the off-chance they win the legal battle to retain ownership of the coins)', 'Also note that one of the coins found in the hoard was an ultra-rare 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece missing the phrase “In God We Trust” — a coin which was never released to the public and which must have been produced and kept within the mint itself', 'A story that describes a gold heist from the San Francisco Mint at the turn of the century could explain the source of the gold coins worth $10 million that were found last month in California’s Mother Lode country', 'Remember the California couple who found $10 million in gold coins on their property?

"– In sad but utterly inevitable news, the northern white rhino has taken another big step toward extinction with the death of Nola, a beloved 41-year-old female who had been at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park since 1989. She was one of the last four remaining members of the doomed species, and the park decided to euthanize her on Sunday because of an infection and other chronic age-related health problems, reports the New York Times. ""It's tough. It's like having your 90-year-old aunt get sick, and there is nothing you can do except give her basic care and keep her comfortable,"" the lead zookeeper told the San Diego Union-Tribune last month.

"– Liberals are just a wee bit unhappy with the deal President Obama struck to increase the debt ceiling. The Progressive Caucus and the Black Caucus will hold a press conference today to announce their opposition to the deal, Raw Story reports. Black Caucus Chairman Emanuel Cleaver delivered the real money quote yesterday, telling Roll Call that based on early reports, the pact looked like “a sugar-coated Satan sandwich.” Rep. Cleaver stood by the quote in an MSNBC interview, saying the bill was “antithetical to everything the great religions of the world teach, which is take care of the poor, take care of the aged.” He said he still needed to review the details, “but on the surface, it looks like a Satan sandwich.” Nancy Pelosi meanwhile darkly hinted that “We all may not be able to support it, or none us may be able to support it.” But Washington Post sources say Pelosi is just firing a warning shot past a dismissive White House, and won't actually block the bill.","['Carl Levin said the president did not

"– About 30 million to 40 million American adults suffer from chronic pain—but it may be all in their heads, a new study says. Researchers looked at 40 volunteers, all back pain sufferers, and found that brain scans could predict with 85% accuracy whether their pain would become chronic. At issue is the emotional response to injury and the relationship between two brain regions, the nucleus accumbens and the frontal cortex, the Telegraph reports. When these brain regions—related to motivational and emotional behavior—get to talking, the odds increase that pain will become chronic, explains PsychCentral. ''The injury itself is not enough to explain the ongoing pain,” says the study's lead researcher. ""It has to do with the injury combined with the state of the brain.'' But while brain scans did connect chronic pain to communication levels in the brain, they did not establish a causal link, notes Health Day News.","['For the study, the researchers used brain scans to examine interaction between two parts of the brain -- the frontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens -- in 40 patients who had back pain develop recently for the first time', 'According to the report, published in the current issue of Nature Neuroscience, brain regions related to emotional and motivational behavior seem to communicate more in those who develop chronic pain', '""Chronic pain is one of the most expensive health care conditions in the U', 'By analyzing the scans, the investigators were able to predict whether the patients would develop chronic pain with an 85 percent level of accuracy', ""The findings suggest that the brain's emotional reaction to the injury is crucial"", '""It has to do with the injury combined with the state of the brain', 'Although the study showed an association between levels of communication in the brain and chronic pain, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship', '""The injury by itself is not enough to explain the ongoing pain,"" Apkarian added', '""For the first time, we can explain why people who may have the exact same initial pain either go on to recover or develop chronic pain,"" senior study author A']"

First of all, if you bought a bunch of tickets with a pool of co-workers or friends, you might want to take a moment to write up a formal agreement before the 11pm ET drawing, the Houston Chronicle reports. Another good idea: distribute photocopies of the tickets to each pool member. ""You never think about these things until after you won,"" one attorney says.

DON'T call everyone you know to tell them the good news—soon you'll be overwhelmed with people hoping to share in your newfound riches.

"– Last year's IRS scandal is back in the headlines. The House Ways and Means panel today formally asked the Justice Department for a criminal investigation into retired IRS official Lois Lerner, reports the Hill. Republicans on the committee pushed the vote through, alleging that emails show Lerner sought to deny tax-exempt status to conservative groups, particularly Crossroads GPS, while letting liberal ones slide. Democrats, meanwhile, accused the panel of political theatrics ahead of the midterms, given that the Justice Department already is conducting an investigation into the matter, reports AP. Some dueling quotes: Republican Dave Camp: ""We think there's reason to believe that laws were broken, that constitutional rights were violated,"" said the committee's chairman.

"– Kendrick Lamar was the king of Sunday's 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, winning six awards on a night full of emotional performances, political moments, and a new, eye-popping Taylor Swift music video. Lamar's ""Humble"" won video of the year, best hip-hop video, direction, cinematography, art direction, and visual effects. He also gave an explosive performance of ""Humble"" and ""DNA,"" backed by ninjas dancing near fire. But the VMAs, hosted by Katy Perry with performances from Miley Cyrus and Ed Sheeran, was tamer than most years, not relying on the shock value and wild antics of past shows, the AP reports. Instead, touching performances and powerful speeches (especially one by Pink) took center stage. Some highlights: Lamar's performance kicked off the three-hour show, followed by the premiere of Swift's video for ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" which featured the singer dressed like a zombie in one scene and surrounded by slithering snakes in another. The video for the track, rumored to be a diss toward Kanye West, also featured Swift in a tub of diamonds, a cat mask, and a car that crashed. Logic performed his inspirational song ""1-800-273-8255,"" named after the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Kesha introduced the performance and also offered words of encouragement: ""As long as you don't give up on yourself, light will break through the darkness."" Rock singer and Oscar winner Jared Leto remembered Linkin Park's Chester Bennington, who hanged himself in July. Leto also mentioned Chris Cornell, who hanged himself in May. ""I think about his band, who were really his brothers, and I remember his voice,"" Leto said of Bennington. ""That voice will live forever."" The night also featured political moments focused on the Charlottesville violence. The Rev. Robert Wright Lee IV, a descendent of Gen. Robert E. Lee, told the audience: ""As a pastor it is my duty to speak out against racism, America's original sin."" Susan Bro, mother of slain protester Heather Heyer then entered the stage, telling the audience: ""Only 15 days my ago, my daughter Heather was killed as she protested racism. I miss her but I know she's here tonight."" Bro also announced she had established a foundation in her daughter's name to provide scholarships to activists. Paris Jackson also spoke out against hatred. ""We must show these Nazi white supremacist jerks in Charlottesville, and all over the country, that as a nation with liberty as our slogan, we have zero tolerance for their violence and their hatred and their discrimination.

"– Kids have a word for it when you land face-first: ""fail."" As an Internet meme, it's called faceplanting. But what really happens when people use their face for brakes? At BoingBoing, Maggie Koerth-Baker looks at the physical results—which aren't pretty—and takes a glimpse at the related field of injury biomechanics. She starts with a paper by a mechanical engineer about a classic faceplant: young man tries to ride bike along a board from shoreline to dock, misses board, lands face-first. (See the video here.) He endured Le Fort II and III fractures, his face cracking in a triangle shape starting at the top of the nose and going down both sides to the upper jaw. Sadly, other researchers say this particular video won't advance the field because the frame-rate is poor; real experiments analyze the 10-20 milliseconds in which injuries occur. So Koerth-Baker delves deeper into injury biomechanics, starting with John Stapp, an Air Force flight surgeon who endured a sudden stop in a rocket sled at 46.2 g's of force in 1954. He broke nearly all the capillaries in his eyes, Ejection Site reports, but his work helped the Air Force design pilot ejector-seats. More recently, studies on NFL concussions have shown that hits from the side or back cause more concussions than hits on the crown of the helmet. Which leaves faceplanters where, exactly? Well, getting seriously injured as we laugh and learn. At least this one, at SBNation, faceplanted on purpose in an effort to help his team.

"– The US and Israel pitched a fit, but it ultimately wasn't enough to fully stop Poland from moving ahead with its controversial Holocaust law. Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday announced he would sign a bill that prohibits speech that states or suggests his nation was complicit in Nazi Germany's crimes. In a concession to critics, though, Duda will have the Constitutional Tribunal examine the law; Bloomberg reports the court has the power to force lawmakers to alter the law's language in whole or part. The New York Times quotes Duda as saying he's adding that step because the ""very painful, delicate issue"" needs to be handled thoughtfully, though the Times sees the move as doing little to assuage those who say it could curtail free speech and whitewash the role some Poles played in the killing of Jews during World War II. Duda said that should the court clear the law, he'd like to see it specify exactly what type of speech is subject to prosecution. As it stands now, using the phrase ""Polish death camp"" to refer to Auschwitz and other Nazi-constructed concentration camps within the country can result in a prison term; claiming the Polish nation ""is responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes"" is punishable by up to three years. In a Washington Post column, Anne Applebaum writes of the law's ""ludicrous"" potential: ""Will the long arm of the Polish state reach out to academic conferences in Tokyo or Buenos Aires if someone uses an incorrect phrase? ...

In the journal Clinical Anatomy, researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia; they take that one step further, hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males. Then they set out to test that hypothesis: In their small study, researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 Turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls. They found ""significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands,"" the researchers report in a press release. The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: The right-hand 2D:4D ratio was ""significantly higher"" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was ""significantly lower""—suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone ""affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain,"" per the study. As for those ratios, the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients. (A recent study found that schizophrenia isn't actually one disease.)","['In a new study of 103 male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 matched healthy male individuals, investigators found that the 2D:4D ratio may be an effective predictor of schizophrenia--there were significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio of the lengths of the second digit to the fourth digit, as well as its asymmetry, in both hands', 'Research suggests that the ratio of the lengths of the index finger and the ring finger in males may be predictive of a variety of disorders related to disturbed hormonal balance', 'There were significant differences between the schizophrenia and the control groups in respect of left 2D:4D and right 2D:4D', '### The production of androgens (mostly testosterone) during the early fetal stage is essential for the differentiation of the male brain', 'Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to assess schizophrenia symptoms', 'Our findings support the view that the 2D:4D AI can be used as a moderate indicator of schizophrenia']"
"– The resignation of a Northern California town's city clerk generally wouldn't garner much in the way of press, but the drama surrounding Kim Lehmkuhl's exit from her Pleasant Hill post is just a wee bit outside the norm. Lehmkuhl was elected to the position in 2012, but things have since grown frosty between the city official and the town, with the Contra Costa Times reporting that the 34-year-old was accused of taking no minutes during city council meetings in her entire first year, and instead tweeting her way through them—under a city account, and in a very opinionated way, the city charged. Some residents called for her to step down (she refused, and the San Francisco Chronicle notes that she did later produce minutes for some meetings), and the council in March announced a November ballot item would seek to change the position to an appointed one, reports the AP. The moves, as it turns out, were unnecessary: Lehmkuhl quit on Monday, in fiery fashion, to take a job in Washington, DC. In an email to the mayor and city manager, she wrote that ""this has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing, and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone. I wish the City the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote, and pathetic pandering attempt by Council."" She also wished the city manager ""best of luck with your imminent unfunded pensions scandal, that is going to be a rough one."" But Lehmkuhl wasn't the only one with blistering words. Said Pleasant Hill Mayor Tim Flaherty at Monday night's council meeting, per ABC7, ""I'm paraphrasing our former President Gerald Ford in saying 'Our long municipal nightmare is now over.' Our city clerk has resigned."" Her city-related Twitter account is no more as well.","['The problem with our city clerk and her performance has just been a distraction to the city staff and to the city council focusing on our work of the policy-making body that we are,"" Flaherty said', ""The council in March agreed to pay a former employee $80 per hour to manage the recall process, because Lehmkuhl -- who was the city's elections official -- could not oversee her own recall"", 'The Pleasant Hill city clerk, accused of spending her time Tweeting during City Council meetings instead of keeping minutes, has resigned with a blistering e-mail in which she wishes the city good luck in finding a “schmuck” to take what she described as an awful job', ""The city sent two staffers in Lehmkuhl's place for the May 8 workshop, and that was how they learned she didn't attend, he added"", ""The posts under the account she used for official city clerk's business were often salted with personal opinions, a controversial practice that raised the ire of council members and the public"", '""I\'m very happy to hear that the City Clerk has resigned,"" said Councilman Jack Weir before giving plaudits to members of the recall team', 'But Lehmkuhl defiantly refused and downplayed both the seriousness of her failure to do her job and the recall effort', '""This has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone,"" Lehmkuhl wrote, adding that she wishes the city luck in finding a ""schmuck"" eager to transcribe the record of council meetings', ""In March, the council agreed to place a measure on the November ballot asking whether the city clerk's position should be changed from an elected to an appointed office"", 'She went on to lambaste the council and members of the public for ""misogynistic jokes,"" ""racist asides"" and ""tinfoil hat"" conspiracy theories uttered during meetings', 'PLEASANT HILL -- City Clerk Kim Lehmkuhl, under fire for months for failing to produce meeting minutes for an entire year and the subject of a recall effort, resigned Monday', 'All five council members and several residents had called on Lehmkuhl to step down as the saga over the missing minutes dragged on for months', 'There is a lot of relief in Pleasant Hill after city clerk Kim Lehmkuhl resigned after accusations that she failed to do the most basic part of her job', 'Lehmkuhl was elected in 2012 and for most of her time in office failed to produce minutes of city council meetings', '""For me the final straw was when I was informed that the county clerk had a workshop for all city clerks for the upcoming (November) election,"" he said earlier', 'I wish the city the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote and pathetic pandering attempt by council, and every tinfoil hat conspiracy theory, racist aside, and NIMBY asshattery from the lovely council meeting frequent flyers, without which, surely our democracy could not flourish', ""As for Lehmkuhl, ABC7 News was unable to get a hold of her, but in her resignation letter she says she's leaving Pleasant Hill for a job in Washington D"", ""Flaherty was the last council member to call publicly for Lehmkuhl's resignation, which he did at the May 12 meeting""]"
"– An intriguing medical breakthrough out of Canada—doctors say they have been able for the first time to communicate with a patient who has severe brain damage. Better yet, the message delivered by the patient was a great one: I'm not in pain. The Canadian Press and the BBC explain that doctors studied the patient's brain waves as they voiced a command: he should think about playing tennis if he were not in pain or about walking around the house if he were. The activities trigger different parts of the brain—motor skills vs. visual associations—and the man's brain waves suggested he was pain-free. ""Scott has been able to show he has a conscious, thinking mind,"" says a British neuroscientist, referring to 39-year-old Scott Routley.

"– All it takes to convince people you're a US Embassy is an American flag, a picture of President Obama, and a whole lot of visas—at least in Ghana, where a ramshackle building in Accra housed a phony embassy really run by organized crime members from Ghana and Turkey, the Guardian reports. What wasn't fake: the US visas they got their hands on and doled out for the past decade. ""The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored,"" the US State Department said in a Nov. 2 statement (per the Washington Post, the news is only being widely reported now). A visa could be had for $6,000 from ""consular officers"" who were really Turkish citizens speaking English and Dutch; customers could also get other documents, including phony birth certificates and bank statements. The ""embassy,"" only open three days a week, advertised itself on billboards and in fliers in Ghana and other West African countries. The process of obtaining a visa legally in Ghana is a ""dreadful experience,"" per the Ghana Business News, which is how these con operations flourish.

"– Soon after Ronan Farrow's Pulitzer Prize-winning expose on Harvey Weinstein ran in the New Yorker came word that he had originally been working on the piece for NBC News. Farrow said the network dropped the story, and when initially asked why, he said, ""You would have to ask NBC and NBC executives about the details."" Now, those details may be emerging, at least via a former producer with the network who spoke to the New York Times and via the Daily Beast's sources. NBC News very vocally denies the new claim that it tried to kill the story, and Farrow had no comment. The Beast lays out a timeline dating to November 2016, when Farrow and producer Rich McHugh decided to report on Hollywood's infamous ""casting couch"" and were reportedly advised by NBC News President Noah Oppenheim to look into Rose McGowan's October 2016 tweet about rape at the hands of a Hollywood exec.","['Over the next several months, Farrow collected evidence that suggested

more headaches in the coming months', 'In spring 2017, according to the sources, Farrow played Oppenheim the audio of Weinstein with Battilana admitting that he was “used to” groping women’s breasts',

"– Efforts to eradicate malaria are going to be hit hard by rising temperatures that open up new altitudes to the mosquitoes that carry the disease, researchers warn. Both mosquitoes and the malaria parasite struggle in chillier temperatures, and a new study has found that the disease climbs to higher elevations in warmer years, the BBC reports. In areas like the highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia, people have never been exposed to malaria, making them especially vulnerable to the spread of the disease. ""We have estimated that, based on the distribution of malaria with altitude, a 1C rise in temperature could lead to an additional three million cases in under-15-year-olds per year,"" one of the researchers warns. Malaria infects more than 200 million people per year and kills around 600,000 of them, mainly children in Africa. But climate isn't the only factor at work in its spread, with the biggest advances in malaria control coming alongside efforts to combat poverty, Time notes.","['Prof Mercedes Pascual, from the University of Michigan in the US, who carried out the research, said: ""The impact in terms of increasing the risk of exposure to disease is very large', 'The team believes that because people living in areas that have never been exposed to malaria are particularly vulnerable to the disease, attempts to stop the spread should be focused on areas at the edge of the spread', 'They corrected for other factors that might influence malaria cases—mosquito control programs, for example, which lead to fewer of the insects; and rainfall, which leads to more—and found that the median altitude of malaria cases moved higher in warm years, and lower during cooler yields', 'To investigate, scientists looked at densely populated areas in the highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia, where there are detailed records of both temperature and malaria cases from the 1990s to 2005', 'According to the latest estimates from the World Health Organization, there were about 207 million cases of malaria in 2012 and an estimated 627,000 deaths', 'The research is published in the journal Science', 'Both the malaria parasite and the mosquito that carries it struggle to cope with the cooler air', '""Our findings here underscore the size of the problem and emphasize the need for sustained intervention efforts in these regions, especially in Africa', 'Researchers have found that people living in the highlands of Africa and South America are at an increased risk of catching the mosquito-borne disease during hotter years', 'Warmer temperatures should mean more malaria, but in recent years the number of cases has actually fallen dramatically , largely because of renewed efforts to fight the disease', 'Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Michigan sifted through regional records in Ethiopia and Colombia, two tropical countries with highland territory, looking at malaria cases from 1990 to 2005 in Colombia and 1993 to 2005 in Ethiopia', 'Prof Pascual said: ""The risk of the disease decreases with altitude and this is why historically people have settled in these higher regions', '"" And even within tropical countries, altitude matters: the disease is much less common in tropical highlands, where colder temperatures slow down both the mosquito and the development of the parasite within it', 'Malaria is one of the most common—and deadly—infectious diseases in the world, sickening more than 300 million people a year and killing over 600,000 people', '3 million malaria deaths have been avoided thanks to the work of institutions like the Gates Foundation']"
"– Just days after he took office in January, President Trump put back in place the ""Mexico City policy"" that keeps federal funds from being funneled to international aid organizations that provide abortions, or even info about them. Now the United States has officially yanked US donations from the United Nations Population Fund (aka UNFPA), the arm of the UN that offers family-planning services in more than 150 nations, Reuters reports. The BBC notes that $32.5 million that was set to be allotted for 2017 will be rescinded, with a Monday letter from the State Department saying the withdrawal of the funds is because UNFPA ""supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization"" in China. The US is one of UNFPA's largest benefactors, coming in fourth for 2015 with just over $75,000 in combined core and earmarked contributions. UNFPA—which relies on voluntary donations from global governments to provide its services, which include those for maternal and child health—put out a Tuesday statement noting the US decision was based on an ""erroneous claim"" about the group's work, which it says lets ""individuals and couples ... make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination."" The State Department letter says the money will be reallocated to the Global Health Programs account, where it will reportedly be put toward family planning, maternal health, and reproductive health in developing countries.

In an interview on Italian TV (parts of which were broadcast on Today this week), Sollecito said he ""has some questions"" about Knox's apparently odd behavior in the hours before Kercher's body was found, UPI and the Independent report. He says Knox left his apartment in the morning to take a shower, and when she returned hours later, she was ""very agitated"" and said she found her front door open and blood on the bathroom floor. ""Certainly I asked her questions,"" Sollecito said. ""Why did you take a shower? Why did you spend so much time there?"" And, he added, ""I don't have answers."" NBC's legal experts think Sollecito is attempting to distance himself from Knox, but in a blog post earlier this month, Knox herself insisted that ""is not the case,"" noting Sollecito ""has plenty of reason for resentment, but not against"" her. She did, however, include in her post part of a recent email she received from Sollecito in which he admitted, ""I don’t want to be punished for, nor have to continue to justify, those things that regard you and not me.

"– Before you get off the plane, always check the seat-back pocket for your headphones, any magazines you might want, and those super-sensitive Homeland Security documents outlining how to protect Super Bowl attendees from an anthrax attack. One government scientist apparently didn't do so, as a CNN employee found out on a recent commercial flight, the network reports. The DHS paperwork, which was found along with a boarding pass and travel itinerary linked to a microbiologist and ex-CIA worker named Michael V. Walter, was marked ""for official use only"" and ""important for national security"" and detailed two exercises (one held last July, one in November) designed to gauge response from health and emergency management officials, as well as law enforcement, to a potential biological attack in Minneapolis on the day of the big game. Noteworthy in the report were calls for improvements in certain areas, which is the point of the exercises so that officials can fix any issues beforehand, per Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst who used to work for the DHS. Still, Kayyem notes leaving the documents on the plane was a ""really stupid thing,"" adding: ""Who knows who else could have picked this up."" It's not clear if Walter, who has headed up the agency's BioWatch program fighting bioterrorism for nearly a decade, was the one who left the documents on the plane.

"– It's a milestone of sorts for conspiracy theorists: The CIA has for the first time declassified documents that detail the existence of Area 51 in Nevada, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The documents, obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request by a national security institute at George Washington University, explain that Area 51 got its start in 1955 because the government needed a place to test U-2 spy planes. Aliens in crashed spaceships are nowhere to be found in the documents. But here's one weird detail that is: The government initially called it ""Paradise Ranch"" to make the ""facility in the middle of nowhere"" sound more alluring to workers. The documents include a CIA map of the site, which is pretty much the same one that has long been available in a Google Maps search for ""Area 51,"" notes CNN. So what's the big deal here?

"– President Trump's Oval Office argument with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi was the talk of the town on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the president picked up where he left off. Trump took to Twitter to continue his push for border-wall funding, this time trying to bolster his argument by citing a mass shooting Tuesday at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France.

Senators are currently willing to approve $1.6 billion in funding for border security, though that money couldn't be put toward wall construction.

"– Police searched woods, divers searched ponds, and a sketch of an apparent suspect spread across social media. All this in the 60 hours after Charisse Stinson reported her 2-year-old son missing early Sunday, claiming he'd been taken by a man who offered her a ride before knocking her unconscious. But there was no ""Antwan"" in a white Toyota Camry with dreadlocks and gold teeth, according to police, who arrested 21-year-old Stinson on first-degree murder charges Tuesday, reports the New York Times. Hours after Stinson told Spectrum News she was ""a damn good mom,"" the body of Jordan Belliveau was discovered in a wooded area behind a baseball field in Largo, Fla., and police say his pregnant mother admitted to putting him there, per the Tampa Bay Times. Stinson said she struck the boy in the face, causing his head to hit a wall, ""during a moment of frustration"" after an ""unexplained, serious injury"" to his right leg, per an arrest affidavit. After the boy suffered repeated seizures, Stinson brought him to the wooded area Sunday and departed without him, police say. Describing Stinson as a ""struggling single mother,"" police on Monday had noted that bloody items in her apartment might've been from an accident that required Jordan to get stitches. Despite that, ""we honestly knew it was her because of her past with us,"" an uncle of the boy tells Fox 13.

"– The heart rate tracker technology in fancier models of Fitbit starts to become inaccurate when people start exercising, according to a study included in an amended class-action lawsuit against the company. In a press release, plaintiffs' lawyers say California State Polytechnic University put both Fitbits and ECG sensors on 43 separate subjects tested for 65 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise, and found that the PurePulse technology in the Fitbits had an ""extremely weak correlation"" with the heart rate recorded by the ECGs. The researchers say the Fitbit measurement was up to 20 beats per minute off during exercise. In some cases, Fitbits on both wrists recorded different rates—and heart rates of zero were recorded on subjects who were definitely not zombies. Fitbit argues that the study, which was funded by the lawyers, ""lacks scientific rigor and is the product of flawed methodology."" The company notes that the ECGs were consumer-grade ones, not clinical devices.

"– Headlines about cars starting on fire tend to do bad things to said car company's stock prices, and investors in Tesla have gotten angry enough to sue. A class-action suit announced yesterday accuses the company of misleading investors on safety issues, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The suit follows a Model S fire on Wednesday in Tennessee, the third such fire in six weeks. The latest happened when the driver ran over a tow hitch, which punctured the electric car's battery pack. The suit says the vehicle “suffered from material defects which caused the battery pack to ignite and erupt in flames under certain driving conditions.” It seeks to cover anyone who bought stock from May 10 through Wednesday. In that span, Tesla stock went from $77 to a peak of $193 in September to its close of $138 on Friday. Of course, with the stock dropping, a Los Angeles Times article raises the question, Is it a good time to buy? The short answer from one analyst is not yet. As more Teslas hit the road and presumably get involved in more accidents, it's likely we're going to be reading about more fires until a fix is in place.","['The firm of Pomerantz Grossman Hufford Dahlstrom & Gross accused Tesla of making misleading statements about the car’s safety, in spite of “undisclosed puncture and fire risks” that the law firm attributes to “material defects” in the Model S battery pack', 'But the new suit alleges that the car “suffered from material defects which caused the battery pack to ignite and erupt in flames under certain driving conditions', '6, the day of the third fire', 'The hitch punctured the electric car’s battery pack, which lies beneath the floorboards and is protected from the road by a steel shield', 'In a fitting finale to a week Tesla Motors executives would rather forget, a law firm announced Friday that it had filed a class-action suit against the electric car maker for allegedly misleading investors over the fire risk posed by the company’s Model S sedan', 'Levy said that once an automaker starts to have thousands of cars on the road – Tesla has sold almost 17,000 cars in the U', 'District Court for the Northern District of California', 'com said its has encountered mechanical problems in its Tesla that have forced the replacement of numerous parts, including the entire drivetrain', 'Baker With reports of car fires and other bad news driving the price of Tesla Motors shares down 30% from its all time high reached almost six weeks ago, is this the time to start buying into the electric car company?', 'It was the third Model S fire in six weeks, and it helped drive down the company’s stock', 'Reviewers have given the Model S high marks for safety, and the car scored higher on tests from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration than any other U', 'The first Model S fire, on October 1, happened after a driver on a freeway outside Seattle struck a curved piece of metal, which punched through the plate protecting the battery pack', 'Earlier in the week Tesla said it lost $38', '""There is no question that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should start looking at this,"" said Clarence Ditlow, executive director for the Center for Auto Safety', 'On Thursday the automaker confirmed that a fire burned up one of its $70,000-plus Model S hatchbacks', 'Penney, claiming the retailer tried to hide its shaky finances from investors']"
"– President Obama made waves in his latest interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC, in which he spoke out against Bank of America’s unpopular new $5 fee for debit card users. “This is exactly why we need this Consumer Finance Protection Bureau,” Obama said.

At the Washington Post, Catherine Rampell runs through some of the reasons, including high unemployment among the young, student debt, rising home prices and rents, and stagnant wages. Considering all that, it's ""rather financially prudent"" for millennials to stay with mom and dad longer, a situation that's not all that unusual in the rest of the world, she writes. But her bigger message is for those ""crusty"" baby boomers complaining about a lack of character in the younger set: ""Well, boohoo."" ""Today’s boomers have benefited for decades from huge public intergenerational transfers of wealth,"" writes Rampell. ""Is it really so much to ask that they make some much smaller private intergenerational transfers to their own children?"" They've paid low tuition and too-low taxes for the services they get back, and they'll hand over an enormous public debt. Plus, today's millennials will have to make up for their out-of-whack Medicare benefits.

"– Congress is getting closer to avoiding another shutdown later this week. The Senate's top leaders announced Wednesday they have sealed agreement on a two-year budget pact that would shower both the Pentagon and domestic programs with almost $300 billion above existing limits, giving wins to both GOP defense hawks and Democrats seeking billions for infrastructure projects and opioid abuse. The agreement is likely to be added to a stopgap spending bill that passed the House on Tuesday and is aimed at averting a government shutdown Thursday at midnight, per the AP. One new hurdle: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California announced she would oppose the budget measure unless her chamber's GOP leaders promised a vote on legislation to protect ""Dreamer"" immigrants. Senate Democratic leaders earlier dropped their strategy of using the funding fight to extract concessions on immigration, specifically on seeking extended protections for young immigrants brought to the US illegally as children. Instead, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer went with a deal that would reap tens of billions of dollars for other priorities while hoping to solve the immigration impasse later. Both he and Mitch McConnell said they were confident of avoiding a shutdown, and the White House signaled that President Trump supports the deal, reports Politico. The plan also contains almost $90 billion in overdue disaster aid for hurricane-slammed Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. It would also increase the government's borrowing cap to prevent a first-ever default on U.S. obligations that looms in just a few weeks.","['If all goes according to plan, the Senate will amend a

"– Floodwaters have poured over a berm surrounding a Nebraska nuclear power plant, forcing a shutdown of electricity used to control cooling systems. Emergency generators were used until an off-site power supply could be connected to the Fort Calhoun plant, and officials say there has been no danger to the public, reports ABC News.

"– Dan and Fran Keller will receive $3.4 million from the state of Texas after being wrongly convicted of sexually abusing children during satanic rituals at their daycare and spending more than 21 years in prison, the Austin American-Statesman reports.

"– If you want to get people to stop boozing it up, don't show them images of glasses of healthy, sparkling water instead of beer—show them an ad that illustrates how too many cocktails can cause cancer to course through their bodies, the Guardian reports. That's the finding of a new study published in the BMJ Open journal that examined English-language alcohol ads to identify which ones proved best at inspiring drinkers to cut down. Researchers tapped a pool of 2,174 Australian adults ages 18 to 64 who drink alcohol at least one or two days a week. A total of 83 ads were shown, and the subjects were instructed to note after viewing each one how motivated they were to reduce their drinking on a scale from one to five, with ""one"" counting as an unmotivated ""Nah, I'm good,"" and ""five"" as ""Take the key to my liquor cabinet and bury it, please."" The most effective ad: ""Spread,"" a 30-second video created by the Western Australian government a few years ago that shows the cancerous mutations wrought after alcohol gets into one's bloodstream. The dud: that ad pushing water over beer. Cancer Council Victoria CEO Todd Harper tells the Guardian that ""Spread"" may have made an impact because folks simply don't know alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen, the most dangerous category. Even though Fergus Taylor, the director of Alcohol Beverages Australia, calls the ""Spread"" ad ""scaremongering,"" Harper notes ""every drink"" ups one's chance of getting cancer, including that of the mouth, liver, and bowel. What these findings should do is spur campaigns that maximize the public's awareness of alcohol so they can cut their cancer risk, Harper says, per Mumbrella. (A study says alcohol can be directly tied to seven cancers.)","['43 As a step towards identifying specific advertisements (ads) and message features that may hold the most promise for population-wide behaviour change, the primary aim of the study was to examine the comparative perceived effectiveness of a large pool of alcohol harm reduction ads with variable features, using a measure of the extent to which adult weekly drinkers felt motivated by them to reduce the amount of alcohol they drink', ""However, online panels are typically used in the advertising industry to predict consumer responses to advertising, and the patterns of ad-elicited motivation observed in this large and varied sample are likely to reflect those in the population, particularly given the similarities between our sample's demographic and alcohol consumption characteristics with those of the benchmark national survey"", 'Fifteen per cent (n=12 ads) was chosen as the cut-off for the sets of top-ranked/bottom-ranked ads, as this provided a balance between having a sufficient number of ads to give stable estimates of the characteristics within each group while also limiting the number of ads to be considered by campaign planners wishing to select one of the top performing for use in their own jurisdiction', ""And for any particular person, the risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including how they are exposed to a carcinogen, the length and intensity of the exposure, and the person's genetic makeup"", 'Self-reported motivation to engage in behaviour change was part of the personalised perceived effectiveness scale validated as a predictor of subsequent behaviour change following exposure to tobacco control ads, 42 and is consistent with recent recommendations that the potential effectiveness of behaviour change messages be assessed by asking participants to report how likely it is that they will be personally affected in the way intended by the message', 'Multivariable linear regression models provided predicted means on the outcome of ‘motivated to reduce the amount of alcohol I drink’ for each ad, and assessed the statistical significance of differences between each ad and (1) the highest and then (2) the lowest ranked ad', 'In addition, 58% of the top-ranked ads featured information on the long-term harms of alcohol consumption, compared with 7% of middle-ranked ads and none of the bottom-ranked ads', ""We used Fisher's exact tests to compare the characteristics of ads that were ranked in the top 15% (n=12 ads) with those ranked in the middle 70% (n=59) and the bottom 15% (n=12) within the overall sample"", ""56 ,57 It is notable that the two highest ranked ads in this study—Spread and What you can't see—predominantly consisted of animated imagery of the internal harms caused by alcohol (which are applicable to all people), rather than footage of models or settings that could be more culturally specific"", 'By controlling for familiarity with the ads in our analyses, we further minimised the potential effect of country of production on responses to the ads', 'In the current study, we focussed on the primary outcome of motivation to reduce the amount of alcohol consumed', 'We compared the characteristics of the top-ranked 15% of ads in the overall sample with the characteristics of the middle-ranked 70% and bottom-ranked 15% of ads ( table 4 )', '55 Mass media campaigns (and other behaviour change programmes) can also address the other key principles of behaviour change, by modelling the desired behaviour (as demonstrated in the how-to-change behaviour ads in our sample), building capacity for change (by advocating for policy change), enabling people to remember the recommended behaviours (by ensuring sufficient campaign exposure and repetition at regular intervals) and providing reinforcement for the desired behaviour (by demonstrating the negative consequences of failing to reduce alcohol consumption)', '36 That is, by carefully selecting ads that appeared in the top-ranked category for all or most of the audience subgroups, countries could use a single campaign approach to motivate key demographic groups to reduce their drinking, while also resonating with the wider population to stimulate a broader cultural change process', '2 In developed nations such as Australia, the UK, Ireland and the USA, population awareness of the range of harms from alcohol is limited', '9 , 11 Together, these findings indicate considerable scope for public education to improve awareness and understanding of alcohol-associated harms, with the broader goal of contributing to reductions in risky drinking', 'The first aim of the study was to rank a large pool of alcohol harm reduction ads according to the extent to which adult weekly drinkers felt motivated by them to reduce their own alcohol consumption', '“We’ve seen how effective campaigns around drink driving and short-term harms such as injury or violence have been in terms of changing our drinking habits, but in Victoria and the majority of the rest of Australia, we rarely see the long-term health effects of alcohol portrayed on our screens,” he said', ""Two questions measured the importance of alcohol to the individual's self-identity (adapted from studies measuring the importance of tobacco smoking to self-identity 50 , 51 ): ‘drinking is part of who I am’ and ‘drinking is a part of my personality’"", 'Other federal agencies, such as the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) may comment on whether a substance or exposure may cause cancer and/or what levels of exposure to a particular substance might be considered acceptable', 'The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is formed from parts of several different US government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)', 'For example, the effects seen in lab studies with very high doses of a substance may not be the same at much lower doses, or the effects of a substance when it is inhaled may not be the same as if it is applied to the skin', 'The promising performance of ads that carried a guideline message suggests that more widespread and systematic promotion of drinking guidelines accompanied by good reasons to limit consumption could serve to provide a new anchoring point for decisions about consumption58 and shift public attitudes about alcohol', 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published study to identify and comparatively evaluate a large pool of alcohol harm reduction ads from many different countries using a standard criterion outcome measure with a large sample of drinkers', 'These two ads are particularly suitable for low-cost adaptation for use in countries other than Australia given that the major adaptation required would be to revoice the ads and translate the final tagline', 'The study subjects were shown three randomly selected ads from the pool of options before reporting the extent to which they felt motivated to reduce drinking following the viewing', 'As part of the American Cancer Society’s role in informing and educating people about cancer and its possible causes, this document provides lists of substances and exposures that are known or suspected to cause cancer', '10 The proportion of 18–29 year olds in the sample (54%) was higher than in the NDSHS due to the use of age quotas during study recruitment', 'Collectively, this information may guide countries to develop campaign messages with the key features identified here, or to select any of the existing top-ranked ads with most potential to motivate change in adult drinking behaviour for broadcast in their own jurisdictions', 'This pattern of findings is broadly consistent with a recent small study of drinkers in the UK which found negative emotion mediated the effects of alcohol harm reduction ads on lower urges to drink', '3–8 For example, an Australian survey in 2014 found prompted awareness of the link between alcohol use and serious conditions to vary substantially, ranging from 80% for cirrhosis of the liver to only 15% for breast cancer', 'Regarding the key communication intent of the ad, the distribution of ads containing a ‘why change behaviour’ intent was significantly different across the three groups, with all of the top-ranked ads carrying a ‘why’ message but only half of the bottom-ranked ads doing so', '77), we identified several specific ads that topped the list and also identified the top-ranked 15% of ads and the message characteristics that significantly distinguished these from lower ranked ads', 'A standard drink in Australia is classified as 10g of alcohol, 47 and to aid accurate responses participants were provided with a visual guide of the number of standard drinks in common serving sizes of different alcoholic beverages', 'A secondary aim was to determine the top-ranked ads for drinkers overall compared with high-risk drinkers and other key demographic subgroups, providing a preliminary test of the merit of a ‘common denominator’ approach', 'The study design minimised the possibility of order effects via random selection of ads from the pool and presenting them in a random order to each participant', 'First, we examined which ads were in the top-ranked 15% within each subgroup and the extent to which these overlapped with the top-ranked 15% for the overall sample ( table 3 )', 'This study has identified specific campaign messages that offer the most potential to increase motivation to reduce alcohol consumption in the broader population, as well as in key demographic and high-risk drinker subgroups', 'The EPA uses a rating system similar to that of IARC when describing the cancer-causing potential of a substance:', 'Furthermore, although rankings varied somewhat, there was substantial overlap in the top-ranked ads across key demographic groups of younger and older adults, men and women and high-risk and low-risk drinkers, as was also reflected in the high correlations in rankings between subgroups', 'These seven items were developed specifically for the study, and were intended to cover the full spectrum of behavioural objectives targeted by these ads, as identified in our recent content analysis', 'Although all of our predicted mean scores on the motivation outcome were adjusted for age (including in the age-stratified models), future research may benefit from a more fine-grained segmentation when considering the effects of age in determining responses to alcohol harm reduction campaigns', 'Todd Harper, Cancer Council Victoria’s CEO said the research shows how campaigns can be used to help inform the public of the long-term consequences of alcohol consumption', 'Instead, the ACS looks to national and international organizations such as the NTP and IARC, whose mission is to evaluate environmental cancer risks based on evidence from laboratory and human research studies', 'In the past 30 years, the IARC has evaluated the cancer-causing potential of more than 900 likely candidates, placing them into one of the following groups:', '55 Further research could investigate the extent to which the effectiveness of alcohol harm reduction ads may be enhanced by addressing these other determinants of behaviour change', '54 Emotional tone of the ads also differed across the three ranked categories, with ads featuring a positive tone more likely to be in the bottom-ranked 15% and top-ranked ads tending to be more likely to have a negative emotional tone (albeit not reaching statistical significance)', 'However, we note that it is possible that the age groups compared in this study (18–29 year olds vs 30–64 year olds) were too broad to adequately capture variation in the range of responses to alcohol harm reduction ads across the age spectrum', 'One means for achieving improved awareness could be through the delivery of mass media campaigns that warn the public of the negative consequences of alcohol use', 'For example, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) maintains a list of “chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity', 'It would also be of interest to examine if certain long-term harms are more motivating than others, given six out of seven of the long-term harm ads in the top-ranked 15% of ads specifically mentioned cancer', 'However, we found that the top-ranked 15% of ads was comprised of ads from Australia (six ads), the UK (four ads) and New Zealand (two ads), and we also found no significant differences in the distribution of ads across ranking categories by country of origin', '“These findings should now be used to plan campaigns that empower the community with knowledge about the harms of alcohol, so they can reduce their cancer risk', 'Published in the British Medical Journal Open, the study compared 83 alcohol education advertisements around the world, with ‘Spread’ reported as the most likely to motivate drinkers to reduce alcohol consumption', 'All models (overall sample and stratified models) employed data that were clustered by participant identification number to account for the same individual rating three ads using the cluster option in Stata, whereby robust SEs are used to allow for intragroup correlation', 'Consumption was also measured using the seven-day timeline follow-back method, 48 to provide an estimate of recent consumption, whereby participants indicate how many alcoholic standard drinks they consumed each day of the past week, with each day and date labelled automatically in the online survey depending on the date of study completion', 'This was determined by asking participants to indicate on a five-point scale (1 ‘strongly disagree’–5 ‘strongly agree’) the extent to which they ‘felt motivated to reduce the amount of alcohol I drink’ while watching the ad', '001, and so was the rank order of the 83 ads between low-risk and high-risk drinkers, r s (81)=0', '57 Studies comparing responses from smokers in 10 different countries found high levels of consistency in responses to different tobacco control ads across countries and demographic subgroups, particularly when these ads used graphic images to depict the physical effects of smoking in a direct and evocative manner', '‘Spread’, created by The Brand Agency in 2010 for the Western Australia Alcohol and Drug Office, shows how drinking too much alcohol could heighten risks of cell mutations and cause cancer', 'The rank order of the 83 ads between the younger and older adults was significantly correlated, r s (81)=0', '77, the highest ranked ad was Spread, developed and funded by the Western Australian state government as part of their Alcohol and cancer mass media campaign', '45 The correlation results suggest that while different ads may seek to influence particular behaviours, if they are successful in doing so, they also elicit an overall motivation to reduce the amount of alcohol a person drinks', '19 , 20 Integration of policy and public education efforts is typified in the successful whole-of-population approach in tobacco control that has changed social norms and reduced adult and youth smoking rates', '13 , 17 , 18 This limited success could be due to many factors, 13 including inadequate reach, frequency and duration, the lack of integration of public education with a sustained comprehensive approach involving other alcohol control policies including price controls 17 , 19 and the unrestricted volume of pro-drinking alcohol marketing which dwarfs sporadic educational efforts', ""Also, the bodies of lab animals and humans don't always process substances in the same way"", 'There are far too many substances (both natural and man-made) to test each one in lab animals, so scientists use what is already known about chemical structures, results from other types of lab tests, the extent of human exposure, and other factors to select chemicals for testing', 'As noted above, the type and extent of exposure to a substance may also play a role', 'Informing the public about environmental factors that affect cancer risk and how to decrease their risk of developing cancer', 'This can make it hard to find a particular substance on one or both of these lists, which are in alphabetical order and may not always use the most common term', '1 About 70% of this alcohol burden is due to long-term harms such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric disorders and infectious disease, with the remainder due to short-term harms including unintentional and intentional injury', 'The current version of the RoC lists about 250 substances and exposures', 'And there are usually many years (often decades) between exposure to a carcinogen and the development of cancer', 'The study was conducted by the Cancer Council’s Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer and funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council', 'We therefore used this general reduced drinking motivational outcome as our primary ranking criterion; however, in a supplementary report, we present findings for all seven motivation items, to assist jurisdictions to select messages with the greatest potential to motivate adult drinkers to engage in a range of behaviours to reduce harm from alcohol', 'We also examined the Spearman rank order correlation between the rankings of all 83 ads across the age, sex and risky drinking subgroups', 'In addition, of the four middle-ranked ads that featured long-term harms, cancer was mentioned in three and other non-specific ‘serious health problems’ were mentioned in one)', 'Unfortunately, many of the substances and exposures on the lists below can often go by different names', 'In their description of the ‘Big Five Principles of Behaviour Change’, Hill and Dixon (2010) describe motivation as being a necessary condition for volitional behaviour, but they note that it is often insufficient on its own', '28 ,29 We therefore recommend that the current findings be used by jurisdictions to identify those ads that, following local pretesting and any necessary adaptations for language and taglines, may help to motivate reduced alcohol consumption within their own adult populations', 'The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), an electronic database that contains information on human health effects from exposure to certain substances in the environment', '9 Population surveys also show poor awareness of the levels of alcohol consumption associated with harm 10 and low-risk drinking guidelines', 'Overall, our findings suggest there may be promise in resourcing alcohol harm reduction campaigns that educate audiences about why they may need to change their drinking by providing information about the long-term harms of risky alcohol use and communicating guidelines for low-risk drinking', 'The distribution of ads differed by emotional tone, with 50% of bottom-ranked ads having a positive tone compared with none of the top-ranked ads', 'Most of the agents on the lists have been linked only with certain kinds of cancer, not all types', 'In particular, it was of interest to note how well the long-term harm ads performed with younger people, who might have been expected to self-exempt from these more distal harms', 'This information makes an important contribution to the limited evidence base on the potential for mass media campaigns to reduce alcohol-related harm', 'Similarly, the rank order of the 83 ads between men and women was significantly correlated, r s (81)=0', 'This process was repeated for the remaining two ads randomly assigned to the participant', 'While top-ranked ads did not differ in their use of graphic imagery, they were more likely than bottom-ranked ads to contain explicit portrayals of drinking (58% vs 8%,

"– Four decades after the Vietnam War, Jim Reischl still remembers how her long hair fell down her back that night in a bar in Saigon. He remembers the drink he bought her—a cup of tea—and her name, Linh Hoa. He also remembers some of the last words she spoke to him before he shipped out in 1970 at age 21: ""She told me she was pregnant,"" he tells the Washington Post. Reischl, now 67, had been warned by his Air Force superiors that it could be a trap to get him to take the sex worker back to America with him, and he never found out if it was just a line, though he's returned to Vietnam four times searching for an answer. Now in his golden years, he's one of several vets hoping to reunite with the women—and perhaps the children—they left behind in Vietnam, sometimes after lengthy relationships, with help from volunteer website FatherFounded.org.

"– A little boy who went out for a bike ride with his family in Menasha, Wis., ended up running to save his mother's life after a stranger opened fire on Sunday, police say. After Sergio Daniel Valencia del Toro, a 27-year-old man apparently upset by the end of a relationship, started shooting on the Fox Cities Trestle Trail Bridge, wounded mom Erin Stoffel managed to get her son Ezra, 7, and daughter Selah, 5, off the bridge and told Ezra to run for help, the Post-Crescent reports. The boy met an unidentified man who called for help. ""It was a little boy who helped save his mother's life,"" the coroner says. Stoffel was shot three times in the attack; her husband, Johnathon, and 11-year-old daughter, Olivia, were killed.

"– On the night of April 1, 1990, a woman crossing the street in Huntington Beach was hit by one car, then a second, and died at the scene. For 27 years, police have tried to figure out who she was—and now she's finally been identified. Andrea Kuiper of Fairfax, Va., an artist who suffered from manic depression, started using drugs, and moved to California. Two months before her death at age 26 that night in 1990, a friend called her family to say she was safe, and they never heard news of her again. They never filed a missing persons report. Now they have answers, and in a statement, her father says they ""are thankful to know what happened to our daughter after all these years. Andrea was loved and respected. She was beautiful. But she was manic depressive, and therefore we had been through quite an adventure."" Authorities, thinking she could be a teenager, submitted her data to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and her story was featured on TV's Unsolved Mysteries. In 2010, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) was created, and authorities added her information to that. But none of those measures led to an identification. Then, this year, the FBI worked with NamUs to closely examine fingerprints, and found a match for the unidentified victim: fingerprints given by Andrea Kuiper when she applied for a job with the Department of Agriculture three years before her death, ABC 7 reports. Authorities are happy to have given the former Jane Doe her identity back, but it's a tragic end for her family; per the Los Angeles Times, Kuiper's dad says they always hoped she'd drive up in a ""car full of beautiful children and say, ‘Hi, it’s me.'""","[""Andrea Kuiper's information was provided to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at the time of her death, officials said"", 'All the family has always wanted, Richard Kuiper said, was to see Andrea driving up to their Virginia home in a “car full of beautiful children and say, ‘Hi, it’s me', ""Investigators said the creation of the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System in 2010, and it's partnership with the FBI in March 2017 to check fingerprints, helped lead to Andrea Kuiper's identification"", 'The closest police got to learning her identity was a few people telling them that her name was Andrea', 'NCMEC recreated images of what Andrea Kuiper may have looked like and the images were distributed to the media', 'After Andrea Kuiper was identified on May 4, investigators worked to locate her parents to tell them about the discovery', 'The last her parents heard of her was from a friend a few months before the accident, who told them Kuiper was safe', '“We’re here to serve the public and try to get a family answers and support the deceased', '""It was one of those once in a career type moments to know that Andrea was Andrea,"" Keyes described', 'Last year, Keyes reviewed the file and reached out to Newport News police “to make sure they didn’t have any new missing person reports matching Andrea’s description,” Keyes said', 'She had a strand of hair wrapped around her finger like a ring, and a lock of hair in her pocket', 'Her job application in 1987 included fingerprints, and someone in the federal government had finally put those fingerprints into a system that the FBI accessed and shared with NamUs, she said', 'For 27 years, no one knew who she was, and her family was never told of her death', 'LAX begins massive relocation of 15 airlines in the central terminal area', 'One of two children, Kuiper loved ice skating and art as a girl — her parents still have some of her drawings, they said in a statement', 'Her family described her as “smart, clever, attractive and persuasive,” according to a news release from the Orange County Sheriff’s Department', 'There was too much trauma to Kuiper’s face to release a photo after her death, said Kelly Keyes, an Orange County supervising deputy coroner', 'Keyes has been leading the effort to get answers on unidentified bodies for about a year and a half', 'She was later identified as Andrea Kuiper, 26, of Virginia', 'The breakthrough came thanks to a partnership between the FBI and NamUs to solve more cases such as this one', 'Not that most of them aren\'t, this was just particularly tragic because she was just crossing the street in Huntington Beach,"" Kelly Keyes, supervising deputy coroner said']"
"– What do you do when a city is sinking? Why, you move it, of course. That's what the Swedish city of Kiruna has decided because iron mining below it has weakened the foundations of houses and buildings, Tech Insider reports. Now LKAB, the state-owned company behind the mining, is dedicating billions of dollars to moving Kiruna about 2 miles east. The ongoing 30-year plan includes relocating 21 particular buildings (like Kiruna's city hall and its attractive church) and paying residents to have their homes demolished and rebuilt at the new location, the Guardian reported last year. An Arctic city that's in darkness most of the year, Kiruna ""will be a bit like a walking millipede with a thousand feet, moving, crawling, slowly ... toward the east,"" says an architect in a promotional video for the plan. Critics say social networks will be shattered by the move and relocated residents will have higher rents, but on the bright side, the new city is supposed to be more walkable and economically diverse. Plus there's a lot at stake: Founded partly by LKAB in 1900, the city of 18,000 supplies the European Union with 90% of its iron. ""There might be some concerns, but the mine has to keep operating,"" a resident says. It's not a first, either: Cities have been relocated before for economic or safety reasons, and other towns are considering moves over climate change, the New York Times notes. Only possible problem for Kiruna? ""Iron is under the new town center, too,"" admits a city official. ""[But] it will be too expensive for LKAB to move the city again.""

"– A Fourth of July hike to see waterfalls near Grand Lake, Okla., took a bad turn once Jo Rogers and her husband, Keith, got home. Soon after their return, Keith tells ABC News, Jo didn't feel well and suspected the flu. But as Jo got sicker and so lethargic that Keith says ""she wasn't making any sense,"" he took her to the ER about a week after they came home—and things continued to worsen. ""She was shaking her hands because they hurt, her feet hurt,"" her cousin, Lisa Morgan, tells KOCO. Then her organs began shutting down, and ""by Saturday morning, her arms and feet were turning dark blue and black. It was crawling up her limbs,"" Morgan says. The diagnosis: a tick bite that infected Jo with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The course of treatment: to amputate all four of her already-gangrenous limbs to give her a chance at life. ""They had to cut off her right leg just above the knee, her left leg just below the knee and both her arms about mid-forearm,"" her husband tells ABC, noting Jo has also been contending with other complications from the disease, including blood clots in her lungs that called for a tracheotomy. Up to 5% people who contract RMSF end up dying, the state Department of Health notes, but death isn't common in patients who receive rapid diagnosis and treatment. Keith Rogers doesn't know how long his wife will be in the hospital receiving treatment and rehab, he tells ABC. ""Every day is a new challenge. I go in there, sit and talk to her and show her pictures of how our two boys [ages 12 and 17, per a GoFundMe page for the family] are doing,"" he tells ABC.

"– In an effort to reach a compromise in one of the two year-end battles facing Congress, Democrats have decided to drop their demand for a surtax on millionaires to finance payroll tax cuts. Without a deal, 160 million workers will face an automatic Social Security tax increase on Jan. 1, but a quick bipartisan agreement on the legislation may be out of reach despite the Democratic retreat, AP notes. ""I don't think it's much of a concession,"" a spokesman for John Boehner says. ""It never had any chance of passing the Senate, let alone the House."" Lawmakers are also battling over a separate spending bill, and the squabble threatens to force a federal government shutdown by this weekend. House Republicans have unveiled a $1 trillion spending bill providing budgets for hundreds of government programs. They aim to pass the bill tomorrow, allowing them to depart for their Christmas holidays, Bloomberg reports.

"– The wreckage of Japan's biggest World War II warship has been discovered more than a half-mile underwater in the Sibuyan Sea, and credit for the find goes to a Microsoft co-founder, AFP reports. Paul Allen tweeted photos on Monday of the Musashi, sunk by US warplanes in 1944. Allen says he found the remains in the Philippines while exploring on his yacht, the M/Y Octopus, and describes it as the culmination of an eight-year search that relied on historical documents from four countries, a ""hypsometric bathymetric survey"" of the ocean floor, and his yacht's robust technology. After surveying the area, Allen and his team of researchers deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle to pinpoint the ship's location, according to a press release via CNBC that calls the Musashi ""one of the two largest and most technologically advanced battleships in naval history."" ""The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel, and as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction,"" Allen says.

A Japanese museum director says he's ""90% sure"" that it is indeed the Musashi, CNN reports. More than 1,000 people died in the ship's sinking.

"– A swimmer who vanished off a Massachusetts beach was found safe and sound Tuesday after treading water for 4 1/2 hours. Randall Hackett, 58, and his 28-year-old son-in-law, Alexander Auerbach, had decided to swim part of the 4-mile distance of Crane Beach in Ipswich around 5pm Tuesday, report the Salem News and WCVB. Both are strong swimmers, and they were clad in wetsuits, but family members were nonetheless concerned when neither had returned to shore after an hour and a half, per ABC News. Shortly after family members reported the pair missing, Auerbach was found on the beach around 7:30pm, about a mile south of the men's starting point, but he said he'd lost track of Hackett because of rip currents and heavy fog. For two hours, the Coast Guard, police, and fire department combed the water before rescuers using an infrared camera aboard a helicopter spotted Hackett treading water a quarter-mile offshore, per WCVB. Hackett was plucked from the water around 9:30pm and returned to the beach, where he walked into his wife's arms. ""The fog was so thick you couldn't even see your hand,"" says Hackett, who was taken to a hospital as a precaution. ""I made the decision to try and conserve energy,"" he adds, noting he clung to a buoy for a time. ""I thought I could survive until morning.""

"– Rod Blagojevich's defense team asked the judge to subpoena Barack Obama yesterday with a motion that was supposed to be heavily redacted. But whoever redacted it did a lousy job; the blacked out text could be easily read just by copying and pasting it, as Capital Fax revealed.

The lawyers say Obama turned down a fundraiser Rezko offered him in exchange for favorable legislative action. Obama has denied even having such a conversation. Obama directly recommended Valerie Jarrett for his old Senate seat, and gave Blagojevich a list of four candidates he considered acceptable.

"– After a week of outrage over child separation at the southern border and a subsequent executive order that claims to stop it, President Trump is again using pointed rhetoric to describe the immigration crisis in America. In a Sunday string of tweets, Trump blasted Democrats, telling them to ""fix the laws"" while praising his own administration for being better than those of Bush or Obama at handing the complex issue. In that same tweet, Trump connected illegal immigration with crime on this side of the border. ""Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!"" he tweeted. As Politico notes, Trump and his supporters have frequently used controversial language when describing undocumented immigrants, specifically when invoking the MS-13 gang. The president did not mention the street gang in Sunday's tweets. However, Trump did say that ""We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country ... we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came."" As of May, federal immigration courts had a backlog of over 700,000 cases and some courts were scheduling hearings after 2021. Per AP, Republican apprehension over Trump's habit of sending off fiery and unpredictable tweets about the hot button issue and their fear of riling conservative voters are undermining GOP leaders' election-year struggle to shove an immigration bill through the House this week. Party leaders are trying to finally secure the votes they need for their wide-ranging bill with tweaks they hope will goose support from the GOP's dueling conservative and moderate wings.","['Mike McCaul, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he talked to the White House on Saturday and ""they say the president is still 100 percent behind us', 'He said he couldn\'t defend helping the Dreamers ""to people waiting in line the right way"" to immigrate to the U', 'The president and his administration have been under intense criticism since the new ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy led to the separation of families apprehended after crossing the border illegally', 'America is party to treaties that govern the treatment of asylum seekers and non-asylum seekers', 'But the president seemed to call Sunday for denying due process to people apprehended after crossing the border illegally, and he did not seem to draw a distinction for people who arrive at ports of entry seeking asylum, as are many of those now coming from violence-plagued Central American nations', 'The U', '""Any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project', 'Since illegal immigration is a federal crime — a misdemeanor for a first instance of illegal border crossing and a felony for someone who has been deported who illegally enters the United States again — the process is handled at the federal level by immigration judges', 'Top Republicans have wanted to hold the votes, win or lose, partly to defuse an effort by GOP moderates to force the chamber to vote on liberal-leaning bills helping immigrants win citizenship', '"" At times, his harsh words have been reserved for MS-13 gang members, but in other instances he is not specific as to what he is talking about and conflates migrants coming across the border with the brutal gang', 'Neither of those have been good looks for Republicans from swing districts with large numbers of moderate voters — the very incumbents who must be re-elected for the GOP to retain House control', ""Republicans who are battling to retain House control have hoped to focus this fall's campaigns on the economy and tax cuts"", 'The measure is the product of weeks of bargaining between party conservatives and moderates', '""I think it\'s important that the House be able to show we can take the action,"" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif', 'As he did last week, Trump complained about the role of judges and the court system in the U', 'The GOP divisions come at a bad time for the party: Elections are approaching and immigration has riveted public attention for months', ""GOP leaders said the House will vote on its compromise immigration bill despite Trump's flashing red light on the subject"", ""Party leaders are trying to finally secure the votes they need for their wide-ranging bill with tweaks they hope will goose support from the GOP's dueling conservative and moderate wings"", 'By Friday, he was tweeting that ""Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration"" and wait until after the November elections, when he said the GOP would approve tougher legislation because it will gain strength in Congress', 'The bill would make citizenship a possibility for ""Dreamer"" immigrants brought illegally to the U', ""In addition, some Republicans are eager for roll calls to show voters back home that they've tried to address the issue"", ""In recent days, the focus has shifted to the Trump administration's wrenching of migrant children from their parents"", '""I think that the best way to pass legislation is to consistently support a position and help move it forward,"" Rep']"
"– It's just 18 seconds long, but a new video released by South Korean researchers makes history for the worst of reasons. The clip shows Korean ""comfort women"" held as sex slaves by the Japanese military, reports the BBC. It's believed to be the first such film clip known to exist, though images of ""comfort women"" had previously surfaced in still photographs.

An American soldier is believed to have filmed the scene, in which a Chinese officer talks to the women lined up in front of a building used as a brothel.

"– Facebook has bought pioneering virtual-reality headset maker Oculus for $2 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg is pretty excited about it. The startup's immersive headset for video game developers has been a big hit, but Facebook appears ready to take virtual reality beyond gaming, Business Insider finds. ""After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences,"" Zuckerberg writes in a Facebook post. ""Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face—just by putting on goggles in your home. "" The headset is ""different from anything I've ever experienced in my life,"" Zuckerberg said during a conference call following the announcement.

Facebook is ""not a game tech company,"" he explained in a blog post. It cares ""about building user numbers, and nothing but building user numbers.""

"– Bill Cosby has generally been avoiding saying anything at all about the rape allegations against him, but he went on ABC's Good Morning America today and agreed to talk at least a little about them: “It’s interesting. When I talk to people they will say, ‘This is a situation that’s unprecedented.’ I, my family, my friends, I have been in this business 52 years. I’ve never seen anything like this. And reality is the situation. And I can’t speak.” Cosby was speaking to youths in Alabama today about the importance of education, and he was asked on GMA about what they may think of the scandal. “I think that many of them may say, ‘Well, you are a hypocrite. You say one thing, you say another.' My point is, 'OK, listen to me carefully. I’m telling you where the road is out. I’m telling you where, as you drive, you are going to go into the water. Now, you want to go here or you want to be concerned about who is giving you the message?'” The remarks weren't exactly extensive, and they're not going over well.

"– Riding in a 140-foot tall balloon filled with 350,000 cubic feet of gas, an American and a Russian have set off from Japan in the hopes of setting two balloon ride records at once. First, Troy Bradley, 50, and Leonid Tiukhtyaev, 58, hope to reach North America and break the current distance record of 5,208 miles, which was set between Japan and the US in 1981. And second, they hope to reach the West Coast in 5.5 days and then head inland another day or two, breaking the duration record of 137 hours (5.7 days) set in 1978, reports the AP. ""Everything went just like a textbook,"" said team social media director Letitia Hill just after takeoff early yesterday. (Bad weather delayed two previous attempts earlier this month.) Mission Control, situated in a small room at a balloon museum in Albuquerque, includes balloonists, a meteorologist, a physician, and a search-and-rescue expert, who are staying in touch with the pilots via satellite phones, reports the Albuquerque Journal. The balloon, called Two Eagles, is equipped with several types of radios, a high-tech navigation system, and basics like food and a first-aid kit. The men will wear oxygen masks and stay bundled up in the 50-degree cabin as they fly at an expected altitude of at least 15,000 feet. It's possible the pilots could be in flight for as many as 10 days, the balloon's apparent outer limits, and it's not clear where they'll come down. ""That’s going to keep us on the edge of our seats for this mission,"" says Hill.

"– Just how bad are things for President Obama a year into his second term? So bad that if the American people got a mulligan on the 2012 election, there's a good shot we'd be looking at a President Romney. A Washington Post-ABC News poll reveals that if the election were held today, Obama would lose the popular vote 45% to 49%. While the Post reminds us that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, is the ultimate decider, it notes that spread roughly mirrors the 4 points Obama actually won by, and reflects plummeting support from his key demographics: Obama won women by 11 points; now, his edge is down to one point. He won voters aged 18-39 by 18 points; that's down to two. He won voters earning less than $50,000 by 22 points; it's down to three. He's now nine points in the hole with voters without a college degree, after winning them by four points. While he'd still win 59% of liberals, that's down from 75%—and 20% now say they'd vote for Romney. Obama's approval rating has fallen 13 points this year to 42%, tying its lowest mark ever in the poll. The culprit, as you might suspect, is at least in part the Affordable Care Act rollout, which 63% think has been handled poorly. The public now opposes the law itself 57%-40%, its worst numbers yet, and 71% favor delaying the individual mandate.","[""That suggests the Republicans haven't left the doghouse so much as Obama and the Democrats, courtesy of the troubled start of the new health care law, have joined them in it"", 'Barack Obama has been hammered by the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, with disapproval of his job performance reaching a career high, opposition to the new healthcare law up sharply and evidence of potential fallout in the midterm elections a year off', 'And the public by 57-40 percent now opposes the law overall, its most negative rating to date, with opposition up by 8 points in the past month alone', ""The president's job approval rating has fallen to 42 percent in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, down 13 percentage points this year and 6 points in the past month to match the lowest of his presidency"", 'Given the breakdown of the healthcare', 'There is, of course, the margin of error and the fact that that the Electoral College -- and not the popular vote -- elects the president', 'TURN - The results overall represent a sharp turnaround in fortune for Obama and his party, which just a month ago were ascendant over the Republicans in views of the budget dispute that led to a partial government shutdown', ""And 70 percent say the country's headed seriously off on the wrong track - up 13 points since May to the most in two years"", 'Today 45 percent of Americans call Obama ""too liberal,"" matching the high, and 46 percent say the same about the Democratic Party', 'Indeed, even with the stock market soaring and GDP and the jobs market gaining ground, disenchantment with Obama has damaged his most critical issue-specific approval rating, for handling the economy', 'And the number who say the Tea Party has too much influence over the GOP has nearly doubled, from 23 percent in spring 2010 to 43 percent now', ""Similarly showing damage in the center, Obama's dropped by 17 points in approval among moderates since January, to 46 percent, compared with his losses among conservatives and Republicans (down 12 and 9 points, respectively, albeit to a far lower level)"", ""The health care law looks most politically hazardous in the states that backed Mitt Romney in 2012; there Americans by 3-1, 46-15 percent, say they're more inclined to oppose than to support a candidate who favors the law"", ""The poll of registered voters shows Romney at 49 percent and Obama at 45 percent in the rematch, a mirror image of Romney's four-point (51-47) popular-vote loss in 2012"", 'And in just the past month, opposition to the health care law has jumped by 16 points among under-30s, with strong opposition up by 21 points', 'Intensity of sentiment is running against the law and the president alike', ""For all the ACA's troubles, Americans divide evenly, 49-49 percent, on whether the law simply is unworkable or the government can recover and implement it successfully"", ""But the ACA's no help even in the blue states that backed Obama; while the division is far closer, 31 percent in those states are inclined to oppose an ACA-linked candidate, vs"", ""He's at career lows for being a strong leader, understanding the problems of average Americans and being honest and trustworthy - numerically under water on each of these (a first for the latter two)"", 'The poll produces evidence that the ACA could spell trouble for Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections', ""ACA - Skepticism about the Affordable Care Act looks to be the driving force in Obama's troubles"", 'Fifty-six percent describe the cancellation of health insurance policies that are deemed substandard under the law as ""mismanagement"" rather than a normal startup problem', ""Obama's loss of support is spread across many demographics, but he has suffered most among the young, the less-educated, the poor and, perhaps most interestingly, among liberals"", ""While the difference between the two is within the poll's error margin, Obama's support is 6 points below his actual showing a year ago"", 'For all this, about as many Americans call both the Republican Party and the Tea Party political movement ""too conservative"" - 43 and 40 percent, respectively - as call Obama and the Democrats too liberal', ""Their view that the country's headed in the wrong direction has gained 20 points since May""]"
"– Was the bloom at one point off the Neil Gorsuch rose? When President Trump first tapped the Supreme Court justice for the job earlier this year, he praised Gorsuch as being the ""best"" candidate for the job, and by many accounts, Gorsuch has since made good at carrying out the president's conservative agenda. And Trump has publicly touted Gorsuch as one of his main achievements so far—but privately things may have been quite different initially. Sources tell the Washington Post Trump was furious after hearing Gorsuch was slamming him in private meetings with lawmakers (specifically a February one with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal) in response to the president's attacks on the judiciary. So furious, in fact, that Trump spoke of yanking his nomination of Gorsuch and finding someone else for the job, sources say. ""He's probably going to end up being a liberal like the rest of them,"" Trump reportedly told Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell during a meeting; a source says McConnell had to talk Trump down. Part of what fueled Trump's ""explosion"" was that Gorsuch didn't seem ""loyal"" and appeared ungrateful for the opportunity of a lifetime position on the Supreme Court, other sources note. What appears to have soothed Trump's nerves: a handwritten letter from Gorsuch, dated March 2 and seen by the Post, expressing his gratitude. ""Your address to Congress was magnificent,"" Gorsuch wrote. ""And you were so kind to ... mention me. My teenage daughters were cheering the TV!"" The White House is pushing back on the Post report.

"– Alain Carpentier thinks he has an answer to chronic shortages of organ donors. The French cardiac surgeon—under Carmat, the French company he founded—has invented what the Independent calls the ""world's first fully artificial, self-regulating heart,"" and it apparently works, at least very initially. Carpentier's creation was successfully transplanted into a 75-year-old on Wednesday; he's said to be responding favorably. If you're wondering why it deserves the label ""first,"" especially considering Robert Jarvik's artificial heart was first implanted in 1982, Carpentier, 80, explains that his is the first heart to self-regulate, mimicking an actual heart. ""If your loved one came through the door [and you had a Carpentier artificial heart], it would start to beat faster, just like a real one,"" he says. Further, surfaces that are exposed to human blood are made in part from cow tissue, rather than synthetic material, which can produce blood clots and therefore require the use of anticoagulants; its design also minimizes the chance of rejection, reports the Financial Times. Most importantly, it's designed to sidestep the need for a donor heart: Reuters reports the current model, powered by external lithium batteries, is expected to keep a patient alive for up to five years. The heart was three decades in the making, and the end result is similar in size to a real heart, though it weighs three times more (at nearly 2 pounds) and isn't sized correctly for all—about 86% of men but only 20% of women, reports Reuters (a smaller model is planned). The expected cost is $190,000 to $220,000, on par with the cost of a traditional heart transplant.

"– Clint Eastwood, Matt Damon … what’s not to like about Hereafter? But not all the critics are overly impressed with this spiritual film that touches on the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 London subway bombings: “The mostly mesmerizing but finally flawed film” mostly “plays like a smart and stylish thriller,” writes Michael O'Sullivan in the Washington Post. But the promise of three separate and “artfully-woven” plotlines coming together for “a collision—or at least a fusion,” is never realized. “The big payoff fizzles.” Mick LaSalle begs to differ: This is one of Eastwood’s best, he writes in the San Francisco Chronicle. “Every shot communicates something precise, whether it's plot detail or a thought or emotion.” The result is a “sympathetic and all-encompassing understanding of the pain and grandeur of life on earth.” In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert concurs: The “enthralling” film “considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact.” Though the subject matter “lends itself to sensation and psychic baloney … this is a film for intelligent people who are naturally curious about what happens when the shutters close.” Another in the thumb's down camp: It tackles big topics ""without having anything to say,” writes Kyle Smith in the New York Post. “The movie drags, yet it feels like it's missing an hour. It features three characters on three continents who barely interact with one another. And after 130 minutes, it stops without concluding.” Eastwood recently promoted the film, but ended up talking about his disagreements with President Obama. Watch that interview here.","['All three movies are responses to the interconnectedness of the world, but ""Hereafter"" is by far the most successful, partly because it has the best screenplay - by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") - and partly because it has a director who understands the difference between important and self-important', 'The newswoman drowns and is revived', 'Like Alejandro Inarritu\'s ""Babel"" and Wayne Kramer\'s ""Crossing Over,"" ""Hereafter"" is an attempt to convey the bigness of life though a story involving disparate characters in different parts of the world', 'Throughout the film, the characters behave in ways that seem reasonable enough, and possibilities are left open, which is as it should be', ""This is the scene that opens the film, and it's a doozy of harrowingly real special-effects"", ""But what's much more fascinating and enriching is Eastwood's Olympian vision, the sympathetic and all-encompassing understanding of the pain and grandeur of life on earth"", 'In the case of Marie, she undergoes the near death experience we often hear reported, with the white light and the figures', ""But it's unable to avoid the even soggier conventions of the movie romance"", ""This vision is consistent in Eastwood's late work, no matter who is doing the screenwriting, and it boggles the mind to realize that this is coming from a guy who, until he was about 60, was best known as an action hero"", 'The world it depicts - our world, the world of the here and now - is bathed in a deathlike pallor of icy blues and grays, whether set in San Francisco, London or Paris', ""The ironic result of all this meticulous care is that we don't see Eastwood's hand but rather have the illusion that this gallery of humanity is telling the story for him"", ""All George has to do is to touch someone's hand and he's plugged into a parallel universe - a universe of actual ghosts and the ghosts of repressed trauma"", 'The closest it comes is the idea of consciousness after apparent death', 'Marie, the newsreader, is played by Cecile de France in such a fresh and likable way that our sympathy is engaged and we understand that whatever happened to her in the first terrifying scene has fundamentally changed her', ""These days, despite his best efforts, he's forever running away from skeletons: both the kind in the ground and the kind in someone else's closet"", 'And the best of them are between the living, not between the living and the dead', ""It takes the film nearly two hours to get there, but finally, near the end of the movie, all three characters wind up in London, for what we've been led to believe will be a collision - or at least a fusion - of artfully woven plotlines"", '(The name of the manuscript, ""Hereafter,"" lends the film its title', 'At the center of the mostly mesmerizing but finally flawed film is George Lonegan (Matt Damon)', 'Many near-death survivors report the same memories, of the white light, the waiting figures and a feeling of peace', ""It's astonishing how many people believe New Age notions, which have the attraction of allowing believers to confer supernormal abilities on themselves and others without the bother of plausibility"", 'In the script by two-time Oscar nominee Peter Morgan (""The Queen"" and ""Frost/Nixon""), which has been directed with admirable restraint by Clint Eastwood, George is a former professional psychic who has shut down his lucrative Bay Area practice to work as a menial laborer', 'The effect is reassuring, but misleading', 'As an actor, Eastwood is used to breaking up a script into a succession of specific actions, and he does the same as a director', 'Make no mistake, Eastwood\'s directorial output, from ""Mystic River"" on, constitutes the 21st century\'s first cinematic marvel, and ""Hereafter"" is among the best things he has ever done', 'Marcus spends the rest of the movie trying to contact his dead brother, or to track down somebody who can', ""It's these dramatic close calls - first the tsunami, then the bombing - that lend the film an air of mounting suspense"", 'The powers of the Damon character seem to be authentic, although what they prove is hard to say', 'Something that somehow involves not only George, and his ability to connect with the other side, but also Marie and Marcus', 'It seems that his ability to talk to the dead through readings is less the gift one might think than a curse', 'Smart because of the way it pulls back, but only a little bit, from a full-on embrace of its central premise: the existence of an afterlife for the human soul', ""It's a thriller because of the pervasive tone of dread and sadness"", '""Hereafter"" stars Matt Damon as George, a man who sincerely believes he\'s able to have communication with the dead, but has fled that ability and taken a low-profile job;

Probably not, but for whatever reason, thousands of viewers have been clicking on webcam footage of the town’s central intersection since “See Jackson Hole” went live. While picturesque Jackson Hole, nestled in the Grand Tetons, boasts stunning views, the intersection is, well, an intersection. There are pedestrians, and cars and trucks braking at a stoplight, Time notes. The chat section offers a real-time commentary on “events” as they happen. A red truck has been repeatedly ogled and appraised on Twitter, inspiring a Red Truck Twitter account and tweets like this one: ""TOO MUCH HAPPINESS FOR #redtruck CAN'T HELP BUT JUMP #JacksonHole."" In an effort to boost tourism, officials in the popular mountain town set up a YouTube channel six weeks ago linking to several webcams.

One of them mused on Twitter: “theres a live feed of a town square on yt with 1400+ WATCHING NOBODY KNOWS WHY THEYRE HERE.” The Independent reports that the origin of the craze was likely a now-deleted post on web bulletin board 4chan that was picked up by Reddit users and spread. “At this point, many people appear to be watching as part of a collective absurdist joke,” notes the paper.

"– An ominous new report on Vocativ says the Sochi Olympics may be the most extreme, security-wise, in the history of the Games—the site describes ""a gulag-style restricted area"" instituted by Vladimir Putin. The Christian Science Monitor calls the restricted zone the ""ring of steel,"" an area 60 miles wide and 25 miles deep that will be patrolled by tens of thousands of security troops and in which everyone ""will be subjected to near total surveillance."" Air Force fighters, drones, anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-saboteur patrol boats will be deployed. Travel in and out of the city will be restricted; public protests and marches will be banned. But the most ominous part: According to the Monitor, some worry that even these measures may not be enough. The biggest potential threat appears to be the North Caucasus Islamic insurgency and Chechen Islamist warlord Doku Umarov, leader of the Caucasus Emirate terrorist group, who has promised an attack at the Games. But there are others, experts warn, who are similarly interested in terrorizing Sochi. ""When we examine these recent Volgograd attacks, it's hard not to notice how well planned and well organized they were. They seem to have enjoyed a lot of logistical help,"" says one expert. ""Terrorism has become a big business, and there are people with a real, material interest in keeping it going.""

"– An Australian artist has been buried alive with a bucket and a book, but don't worry—they plan to dig him out Sunday. More than 3,000 people watched Thursday as Mike Parr, 73, descended a ladder into a 25-foot-square box under a road in Hobart, Australia, for a performance piece called ""Underneath the Bitumen the Artist,"" the New York Times reports. The confinement was billed as a memorial to victims of totalitarian violence and British colonialism in Australia, notes ABC News Australia, but many assumed it was about local Aboriginal Tasmanian history being buried—particularly the 19th-century Black War in which British settlers nearly wiped out Indigenous Tasmanians. And that sparked a few fighting words. ""It is a bit insulting, really,"" says Tasmanian Aboriginal Center CEO Heather Sculthorpe, per Pedestrian. ""If they have any interest in telling the Aboriginal story then they should have put it out there for Aboriginal people to do it."" But an Aboriginal activist called Parr ""courageous"" and said that ""we support this bloke."" Meanwhile, Parr sits below Hobart traffic with his thermos and a microphone that lets his team monitor his breathing. The apparent risk is old hat for Parr, who in past works has nailed his arm to a wall, sewn his mouth shut, and stayed in a glass cage for 10 days with only water to survive. But what if he never emerges from this one? ""I haven't thought of that,"" he says. ""No, no, no, I'm coming out definitely. I have all sorts of performance plans.""

"– Black leopards may owe thanks to a team of scientists at Australia’s James Cook University. The rare leopards, an endangered species living on the Malay Peninsula, have been hard to identify because each one appeared the same—until now. The researchers discovered that the big cats actually have complex designs of spotting when viewed through an infrared flash, according to a press release. ""Most automatic cameras have an infrared flash, but it's only activated at night,"" says a researcher on the project. ""However, by blocking the camera's light sensor, we can fool the camera into thinking it's night even during the day, so it always flashes."" The spots make it easier for humans to identify and track black leopards, which should save more leopard lives. ""Understanding how leopards are faring in an increasingly human-dominated world is vital,"" says lead author Laurie Hedges. Few leopards actually live on the Malay Peninsula, perhaps due to poaching, while wire snares are killing them and wildlife markets are selling leopard body parts and skins. The rapid elimination of Malaysian forests is also depriving leopards of suitable habitats. The black panther—or leopard in Asia and Africa—has long had a ""mythical aura"" dating back to Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book and Stan Lee's creation of the Black Panther superhero, Mongabay.com reports. Another neat fact: The black leopard is ""perhaps the only known example of a wild mammal with virtually an entire population composed of black individuals,"" says Hedges.

"– The inventor of a popular Spider-Man web-shooting toy can't keep reeling in royalties after his patent ran out, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 today. Stephen Kimble sold his patent on the toy to Marvel in 2001, and as the Verge explains, Marvel said it would pay him royalties indefinitely. But when it uncovered a 1964 Supreme Court decision that found royalties could cease once a patent expired, Marvel in 2010 halted payments. It's a ruling that's perhaps garnering more headlines than usual, thanks to the number of comic-book jokes Elena Kagan incorporated into the opinion she wrote for the court.

"– Bullied kids are at greater risk of a range of psychological problems years later, a study suggests. ""Psychological damage doesn’t just go away because a person grew up and is no longer bullied,"" says a researcher.

"– President Obama on Wednesday told the Senate to do its job and at least give his eventual Supreme Court nominee a hearing: ""They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates,"" he told reporters, per CBS News, but it's clear their ""constitutional duties"" include at least allowing a hearing. A hearing on whom? Well, per multiple sources who spoke to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, the White House is currently vetting Brian Sandoval, the Republican governor of Nevada. He's described as a ""centrist"" by the Post, who says ""some key Democrats"" see him as ""perhaps the only nominee"" Obama might be able to get Republicans to consider. Mitch McConnell and the Judiciary Committee have pledged to take no action on any Supreme Court nominee from Obama. Would that change if the nominee is a member of their own party? Three GOP senators who sit on the Judiciary Committee all said no, but other Republican senators say getting a nominee like Sandoval could be cause to reconsider. Some Democrats believe nominating Sandoval would put some Republicans up for re-election in November in an awkward position, and could ultimately force the Senate to break its blockade. Sandoval, who has a ""bipartisan record"" per the Post and is aligned with Democrats on abortion rights and the environment, met with Harry Reid Monday, and a source says he allowed the vetting process to proceed but said he hadn't decided whether he'd accept a nomination.

It dredges up 2009 findings by British archaeologist Simon James, who asserts that such a poison gas was used during a siege on the Roman-controlled city of Dura-Europos around AD 256. The site was excavated throughout the 20th century, first in 1920; in the next decade, the bodies of 20 armor-clad Roman soldiers were found in one of the counter-mines they dug in order to access the tunnels made by the invading Sasanian Persians. The original theory was that the collapse of the tunnel killed them. But James offered proof that the Romans were actually gassed: A jar near the bodies contained residue composed of pitch and yellow sulfur crystals. National Geographic shares James' explanation: ""I think the Sasanians placed braziers and bellows in their gallery, and when the Romans broke through, added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the Roman tunnel."" Death would have come within minutes. There is one bit of archaeology that could predate it: a sulfur and pitch fireball that struck Alexander’s army in 327 BC. But a Stanford research scholar notes that there's no way to determine whether it was purposefully or accidentally ignited. (More on this history front: Researchers now say ancient Egypt sprang up faster than we thought.)","['In one of the tunnels, a pile of bodies, still completely fitted with their weapons and armour, testified to the horrors of the battle', 'Greek historian and Athenian general Thucydides described how, during the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans created a sulfur and pitch (in this case pine resin) fire at the siege of Plateia, Greece, in 429 BC', 'Mayor described the skirmish in the tunnel and the presence of burnt residue as an early example of archaeological evidence for a chemical incendiary in her 2003 book “Greek Fire, Poison, Arrows and Scorpion Bombs', 'Indeed, the Sasanians placed fire pits strategically throughout the tunnel, and when the Romans broke through, they gassed them by adding sulfur crystals and bitumen to the fire', 'In the 1930s, archaeologists unearthed dramatic evidence of the fight', '), one of the earliest Greek writers on the art of war, suggested combining pitch and sulfur to defend against sieges', '“Defining what constitutes a chemical weapon in antiquity is complex, but this is certainly one of the earliest archaeological finds of the addition of chemical accelerants to a fire to produce toxic fumes,” Adrienne Mayor, a research scholar in classics and history of science at Stanford University, told Discovery News', 'Image: At the Palmyrene Gate, the principal entrance to the city of Dura Europos, toxic gas brought death more than 1,700 years ago', 'Trying to enter the city, the Sasanians dug tunnels underneath its walls', 'According to University of Leicester archaeologist Simon James, who published his findings back in 2009, poison gas was used in Syria more than 1,700 years ago when a Roman fort at Dura-Europos became the site of a violent siege by the powerful Sasanian Persian empire', 'At the time, the researchers believed the trapped Roman soldiers had died after the tunnel collapsed']"
"– Two animal rights activists who authorities say went on an epic vigilante road trip across the US have been arrested and face jail time. Joseph Buddenberg, 31, and Nicole Kissane, 28, both of Oakland, are accused of freeing about 5,000 mink from various farms along with a slew of vandalism incidents, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Prosecutors say the pair set out in June 2013 in a Honda Fit and began their spree by vandalizing a San Diego fur store with paint and Super Glue. After that, they allegedly freed mink from cages at farms in Idaho, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Pennsylvania, along with one lucky bobcat in Montana, reports the San Diego Tribune. They also vandalized other stores and vehicles (including a police chief's car) along the way, say authorities. “Whatever your feelings about the fur industry, there are legal ways to make your opinions known,” say US Attorney Lura Duffy. “The conduct alleged here, sneaking around at night, stealing property and vandalizing homes and businesses with acid, glue and chemicals, is a form of domestic terrorism and can’t be permitted to continue.” The pair allegedly wrote of their spree in encrypted ""communiques"" on activist websites as it progressed.

"– In 2012 the average medical-school grad owed about $162,000 in student loan debt. But many of these newly minted doctors can, thanks to one government program, pay just a few hundred dollars a month on their loans—in some cases, far less than the interest that's being tacked on each month. And after 10 years, when the balance has swelled above $200,000, they can have whatever they owe wiped clean. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at this expanding class of borrower: graduate or professional-school students with a six-figure loan who don't expect or intend to pay it back. That attitude isn't a flouting of the rules. As the Journal reports, one 2012 program allows borrowers to pay a max of 10% of their discretionary income (that's any adjusted gross income beyond 1.5 times the poverty line.) And while undergrads are prevented from taking on more than $57,500 in federal loans, as of 2006 grad students stopped being restricted in a similar manner: Once they've borrowed $138,500 in government Stafford loans (that figure includes undergrad debt), the roughly 10-year-old Grad PLUS loans step in, in many cases eliminating the need to fill the gap using private loans. Grad PLUS was actually supposed to help taxpayers, because the interest rates on these loans were higher. But a 2007 measure allows those working full-time for a federal agency or nonprofit to have their balance wiped away if they make 10 years of payments (which, yes, can be capped at the aforementioned 10%) on time—at the taxpayers' expense. The Journal notes that 73% of America's hospitals are nonprofits or government owned, meaning doctors working there qualify.","['2018 Federal Poverty Guidelines for the 48 Continental United States', 'Eligibility for advance premium tax credits in the individual marketplace (exchange) is determined by 2017 federal poverty guidelines for the remainder of the 2018 coverage year', 'The 2018 federal poverty guidelines have been released', 'For more about the FPL guidelines, see this article by the George Washington University Milken Institute of Public Health: Poverty vs', '2018 Federal Poverty Guidelines for Alaska', 'Federal poverty levels are used to determine eligibility for certain federal health programs, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)', '2018 Federal Poverty Guidelines for Hawaii', 'Eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP in 2018 is determined by the 2018 poverty guidelines', '2018 Federal Poverty Guidelines']"
"– New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has a new book, Off the Sidelines, out next month, and it takes a frank look at the reality of being a woman on Capitol Hill. Among the more surprising and perhaps not-so-surprising tidbits: Gillibrand reveals she had lost 50 pounds after giving birth when a male senator squeezed her waist from behind. ""Don't lose too much weight now,"" he said. ""I like my girls chubby."" The Washington Post notes that Gillibrand says ""he was one of her favorite senators(!).""

A Southern congressman even told her once, ""You know, Kirsten, you’re even pretty when you're fat,"" Gillibrand wrote, per the New York Post. ""I believed his intentions were sweet, even if he was being an idiot."" Perhaps all the sexist idiocy helped her bond with Hillary Clinton. ""I will help Hillary get elected,"" she told People while promoting the book. ""In my mind, she's definitely running"" in 2016, Gillibrand adds.

"– Researchers have managed to produce sperm cells from embryonic stem cells—and for the first time, the sperm worked, resulting in healthy baby mice. Researchers in Japan mixed the embryonic stem cells with certain proteins and hormones. They converted the resulting cells into germ cells, which they implanted in the testes of mice. There, they developed into working sperm, Discover reports. Researchers hope the discovery will lead to male infertility treatments, notes ScienceNow. Scientists had previously created sperm-like cells, but they didn’t function. Though the experiment was a success, “very difficult” issues remain—both physical and ethical, says a researcher. For one thing, the scientists would like to generate the sperm cells in the lab, without having to involve the mice at all. They hope to generate eggs, too. But questions remain over whether the process used for mice will work on humans.","['They would like to learn how to develop sperm completely in the laboratory instead of injecting primordial germ cell-like cells into the testes for maturation', 'So taking a different approach, the scientists cultured mouse ES cells in cocktails of growth factors and proteins to produce epliblast-like cells that they could keep alive only for several days', 'The Kyoto group concluded that when the lab-created epiblast stem cells gained their ability to grow in dishes, they may have lost their ability to form germ cells', 'When injected into the testes of mice unable to produce their own sperm, these primordial germ cells matured into sperm that were able to fertilize eggs in vitro', ""Using embryonic stem (ES) cells, which in theory can produce all of the body's cell types, several teams made some progress in the past few years but were unable to produce viable sperm or eggs"", 'Now a Kyoto University group has found a way to turn mouse ES cells into sperm precursor cells and to use the resulting sperm to produce normal mouse pups']"

"– A court ruling in Ireland has done a strange thing—legalized possession of certain psychoactive drugs such ecstasy, ketamine, and magic mushrooms. But the freedom is expected to last only about a day as lawmakers race to make the drugs illegal again, reports TheJournal.ie. The rush legislation became necessary after an appeals court today declared a 1977 drug law to be unconstitutional, though the ruling didn't affect older drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, reports the Irish Examiner. Lawmakers knew the decision was potentially looming and had legislation prepared in advance, but it will take about 24 hours to get it in place. ""All substances controlled by means of Government Orders made under section 2(2) cease to be controlled with immediate effect, and their possession ceases to be an offense,"" says Ireland's Department of Health, as per the Irish Times. ""These include ecstasy, benzodiazepines, and new psychoactive substances, so-called 'headshop drugs.'"" While the loophole will be quickly fixed, the court's decision means that ""dozens"" of previous convictions have been called into question, says the nation's top health official. They'll have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.","['The court said earlier that Section 2(2) of the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act, under which the regulation was brought in, was unconstitutional because it purports to vest in the Government law-making powers which are in the exclusive authority of the Oireachtas', 'Emergency legislation will go through the Dáil tonight and the Seanad tomorrow and be sent to the President for signature to restore the ban by Thursday on possession of the drugs', '2 of the 1977 Act cannot be read in isolation and must be read in the overall context and purpose of the Act which is to protect individuals and society from the misuse of certain harmful substances', 'The court ruling found that the 1977 Act was being added to via ministerial order without recourse to the Oireachtas, in violation of article 15 of the Constitution', '“This included the preparation of emergency legislation to be drafted in the event of a negative outcome for the State', 'In the Bederev case, the judge said, the fundamental choice which remains with the Government, for the purposes of the 1977 Act, “is which dangerous or harmful drugs are liable to misuse such that they should be declared controlled drugs”', 'The conclusion that this section of the Act purports to vest in the Government what, in the absence of appropriate principles and policies in the legislation itself, “are in truth law-making policies is accordingly unavoidable”', 'The matter was appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Government made preparations for a possible negative outcome', 'The ban on possession of over 100 drugs was overturned this morning when the Court of Appeal ruled the relevant law to be unconstitutional', 'The use of terms such as “misuse”, “dangerous” and “harmful” in the title of the 1977 Act “represent laudable and desirable objectives', 'A ruling in the Court of Appeal on the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 this morning effectively means that the possession of certain drugs, which had been illegal, is currently legal', 'However, they do not in themselves constitute a sufficient restriction on the more or less unlimited power of regulation vested in the Government by Section 2(2) of the Act in relation to what substances should be declared controlled drugs, the judge said', 'On behalf of the Court of Appeal, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan said given what had been done in relation to this substance, it might also be asked whether it would be open to the Government to employ the same law to ban other types of drugs which are in everyday use and which are potentially harmful and liable to be misused such as alcohol and tobacco', 'Mr Varadkar will introduce the legislation in the Dáil later on Tuesday and the intention is that it will pass through all stages in the Dáil and Seanad within 24 hours, the statement added', '“The State successfully defended the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 in the original High Court hearing in March 2014', 'In what the Court of Appeal said was a “constitutional issue of far-reaching importance”, the three-judge court unanimously said a regulation making the possession of methylethcathinone illegal was invalid', 'Given the breadth of Section 2(2) of the 1977 Act, the Government is “more or less at large in determining which substances or products should be declared controlled drugs”', 'The case concerned a prosecution of a man for possession of methylethcathinone which was among a number of substances put on the controlled drugs list in 2010', 'Varadkar is to rush legislation through the Dáil and Seanad over the next few days to deal with possession of ecstasy, ketamine and benzodiazepines', 'In particular, it was argued by his counsel Sunniva McDonagh, the decision to ban a particular drug was a matter to be considered by the Oireachtas before the relevant government minister could formally initiate the ban', '“It does affect the possession of certain newer psychoactive substances which have been added to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by successive governments', 'It’s now understood that the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill will be taken in the Dáil by Health Minister between 8pm and 11pm tonight', 'Not to do so was an “abdication of the role of the Oireachtas” and an impermissible delegation of unfettered power where there were no guiding principles for doing so, it was claimed', '08pm Minister for Health Leo Varadkar has confirmed the Government is to rush through emergency legislation to ban the possession of certain drugs', 'The Oireachtas may not always be equipped or able to react with sufficient speed to deal with the emergence of new substances and misuse patterns, Mr Justice Paul Gilligan said in his High Court decision', 'The emergency legislation I am introducing today will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment,” Minister Varadkar said']"

"– With an unprecedented double recount underway in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott is fighting to get state police involved. The Republican governor—who is clinging to a slim lead in his Senate race with Democratic rival Bill Nelson—filed lawsuits Sunday calling for elections officials in Palm Beach and Broward counties to turn ballots, voting machines, and vote-counting machines over to law enforcement at times when votes aren't being counted, reports Reuters. Scott has claimed that ""unethical liberals"" in the two heavily Democratic counties are trying to steal the election, in which he currently has a lead of just 12,562 votes over Nelson, the Miami Herald reports. One of Scott's lawsuits warned that Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes could ""destroy evidence of any errors, accidents, or unlawful conduct"" if she had ""unsupervised, unaccountable, and unfettered access to the ballot boxes."" Florida Democrats reacted angrily, calling the move to involve police an ""abuse of power,"" the Herald reports. State police and election officials say they have found no evidence of fraud, though protesters, some of them holding pro-Trump signs or chanting ""Lock her up,"" still gathered outside Snipes' office on Sunday, the AP reports. A recount is also happening in the governor's race. (Palm Beach County officials say it will be ""impossible"" to meet the Thursday recount deadline.)","['In a conference call with reporters, Tim Cerio, an elections attorney representing Scott in South

"– Bonnie and Clyde appear to be off the hook after the most shocking moment in Oscars history—the blunder that saw La La Land announced as Best Picture, only for Moonlight to be declared the real winner when the former film's producers had almost finished their speeches. Accounting firm PwC, which oversees the ballot-counting, says Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were handed the wrong category envelope. ""We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred,"" the company formerly known as Price Waterhouse Coopers said in a statement to the AP, apologizing to the presenters, both movies, and Oscars viewers for the fiasco. A roundup of coverage: The Guardian has photos showing moment by moment how things went wrong. Beatty can be seen carrying the red envelope for ""Actress in a Leading Role,"" which he opens, then hands to Dunaway. He later said he was confused because it said ""Emma Stone: La La Land."" She reads out the movie title. With the La La Land team on stage, Oscars overseers can be seen examining the envelope. USA Today reports that as the La La Land team went on stage, a PwC accountant backstage shouted ""He took the wrong envelope!"" and ran onstage. ""I was ecstatic, it was amazing. I thought we won an Oscar,"" La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz tells the Hollywood Reporter. But then, ""some guys in headsets started buzzing around. It became clear that something was wrong."" The New York Times has a transcript of the chaotic minutes onstage. ""I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight,"" says Horowitz graciously. La La Land star Ryan Gosling could be seen apparently trying not to laugh during the mix-up, though the BBC's Martha Kearney says he had a ""face like thunder"" while waiting for a limo after the ceremony. This has never happened before in any category in Oscars history, Vox reports in a look at how PwC handles the envelopes—and at its procedure for handling mix-ups. ""It was very quick, I can't talk about it. The card read that way. It was a very odd thing,"" Dunaway tells the Telegraph, adding: ""It wasn't Warren's fault."" La La Land star Stone told the media she was excited for Moonlight, which she considers one of the best movies of all time, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. But she added: ""I was also holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time. So whatever story, I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card."" Variety notes that it was also a shock to many that Moonlight had won Best Picture at all, though it had won more best film prizes from critics groups than La La Land. It turns out there was a second big fail on Sunday night.","['It was nothing less than a shock for Barry Jenkins’ intimate study of a black youth coming to terms with his homosexuality to walk away with the win: Damien Chazelle’s “La La Land” had been widely tipped as the frontrunner on the strength of a dominant precursor showing and top prizes from the Golden Globes, the Producers Guild, and the Directors Guild', 'Throughout the night, categories kept going to movies that humanized the targets of Trump’s tweets, proposed laws, and vitriol, whether it was the documentary short winner The White Helmets or the Iranian foreign film winner The Salesman', 'UPDATE: Just after midnight PST, the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers (the company that for decades has tallied the Oscar votes), released a statement apologizing for the gaffe: “We sincerely apologize to “Moonlight,” “La La Land,” Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture', 'Think of everything that had to go wrong here: Not only did the wrong envelope have to be handed to Beatty and Dunaway, but it had to include the name of the one nominee in the Best Actress category who appeared in a film nominated for Best Picture', 'The three credited producers for La La Land were almost through their triumphant speeches — indeed, the third, Fred Berger, was in the middle of speaking — when producer Jordan Horowitz was forced to take the microphone and say the film had lost to Moonlight', 'The traditional high point of the marathon Oscars telecast collapsed in ignominy as organisers were forced to acknowledge that the wrong film – La La Land – had been named best picture winner, instead of the actual victor, Moonlight', ""Vikander, the first presenter of the night, rests on a chair backstage, bopping her head (and massive diamond necklace) to Timberlake's Can't Stop the Feeling!

"– The latest higher education campus to see protests over racial issues: California's Occidental College, where whites make up 50.6% of the student body and minority students say the campus climate is inhospitable. Students have been protesting over diversity issues, with a list of demands including more programming and resources for ""black and other marginalized students,"" a ""fully funded and staffed Black Studies program,"" and more tenured faculty of color. As of Monday, students were occupying the college's administrative building, insisting that if those demands are not met, President Jonathan Veitch resign, the Los Angeles Times reports. Students are upset at how the administration has handled race-related complaints, and they say that during a demonstration last week that included a march to Veitch's home, Veitch left when students started talking about how administrators have handled sexual assault allegations. An associate VP at the school says Veitch simply ""realized his presence there was no longer being constructive."" As for this week's occupation, ""We're not going to shut anything down,"" he says. ""They've been conscientious and respectful. They'll be able to stay 24 hours a day."" School officials are reviewing the students' demands, he adds, and a chief diversity position in the administration is already planned. But, per USA Today, during last week's protest, Veitch told students, ""We simply can’t meet every demand on that list. But I can tell you that I will honor the conversation. I do not cling to this job. I’m happy to resign."" One protester tells LA Weekly that if demands are not met by Friday, ""we'll occupy until his [Veitch's] resignation."" She says as many as 400 students are taking part, eating delivery pizza and sleeping in sleeping bags. ""We're occupying all the hallways. The staff is just walking over students.""

"– The iPhone 5 will be available on Sprint's network as well as Verizon's and AT&T's when the new phone is launched, insiders tell the Wall Street Journal.

"– Another big lead, but yet more frustration in the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: Officials say a Thai satellite has detected ""300 objects of various sizes"" floating near the search area in the Indian Ocean, reports the AP. Another set of satellite images released yesterday showed 122 ""potential objects""—but severe weather prevented planes from searching the area today, Reuters reports.

""Anybody who's out there is coming home and all additional sorties from here are canceled."" The latest images, together with the possible debris field spotted by a French satellite, add to what the BBC calls ""a growing body of circumstantial evidence"" suggesting the flight came down in a remote part of the Indian Ocean—though the Boeing 777's black boxes could now be hundreds of miles away from any floating debris.

As a nominal Christian—and a neurosurgeon with Harvard credentials—Alexander admits he had envied ""those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally,"" he writes at the Daily Beast.

In church, however, he ""saw everything with fresh eyes,"" feeling again the universal love of his journey in the stained-glass windows, bass notes of the organ, and a painting of Jesus.

"– Carrie Russell apparently thought little of shipping her Adderall to Japan before moving there to teach English. But Japanese police saw it differently, arresting the 26-year-old American last month for allegedly smuggling illegal amphetamines into Japan, the Oregonian reports. ""We're left in a state of disbelief,"" says her dad, a Portland teacher. ""We would never imagine something like this assaulting us from a civilized country like Japan."" But Adderall is strictly illegal there, and police can hold Russell for up to 23 days without charging her. Meanwhile, her family, US politicians, and even her doctor are trying to get her out of a possible years-long prison sentence—for carrying a drug that's one of America's most widely prescribed, NPR reports. Trouble is, Japan's drug laws are among the world's toughest. The country routinely announces busts of amphetamines, which Yakuza crime syndicates smuggle into Japan for those who pull long hours, like white-collar workers, students, and truck drivers. Another problem: Russell's mom sent her the prescription in an old Tylenol bottle, which created the appearance of smuggling. She says she did it to ward off thieves and avoid identifying Russell's illness—attention deficit disorder—in a country where mental illness is stigmatized. But warnings against taking Adderall to Japan do exist online, and so far Japanese authorities haven't budged. ""She made a mistake,"" her stepfather wrote Japanese prosecutors.

"– Diagnoses have just been made for patients who've been dead for thousands of years. Researchers digging in Egypt have uncovered six cases of cancer among ancient Egyptians, including a young child with leukemia, a middle-aged woman with a carcinoma—most likely ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer—and a middle-aged man with a preserved tumor indicating rectal cancer, per Live Science and ScienceAlert. Based on those and three other cancer cases perhaps caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), found among the remains of 1,087 Egyptians buried 1,500 to 3,000 years ago in a cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis, researchers say ancient residents had a 0.5% risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes, compared to the ""100 times greater"" risk of 50% for people living in the West today. In most cases, researchers had to identify cancers based on bone damage, including holes left by tumors, and admit traces of disease could've long ago vanished. Still, the finding makes sense since ancient Egyptians had significantly shorter life spans than modern humans (which would affect lifetime cancer risk) and ""the carcinogenic load in their past environments would have been considerably less carcinogenic than modern Western societies,"" anthropologist El Molto and doctor Peter Sheldrick write in the International Journal of Paleopathology. As three of the six cases occurred in people who died relatively young, in their 20s and 30s, the pair suspect HPV could be to blame. ""HPV is a confirmed cause of cancer of the uterine cervix and testes"" and ""both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts,"" write the authors, who found no evidence of cancer treatment.

"– After six days with no fresh pings detected, the chief of the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 says it's time to go underwater. The Bluefin-21 underwater autonomous vehicle will now be deployed to search for wreckage in an area defined by signals picked up last week that are believed to have been from the missing jet's data recorders, reports the BBC. Search chief Angus Houston says the robotic sub will be in a ""reduced and manageable search area on the ocean floor"" and, with the data recorders' batteries now almost certainly dead, efforts to detect pings will cease. On its first 24-hour mission, the Bluefin-21 will search an area of around 15 square miles, producing a high-resolution map of the sea floor, the Los Angeles Times reports. Houston warns, however, that the underwater search will be a ""slow and painstaking process"" with no guarantee of results. The area being searched, he says, is extremely deep—2.8 miles—and is largely unknown terrain ""new to man."" An oil slick detected on the surface of the area last night, meanwhile, is being analyzed and officials believe it didn't come from any of the search vessels, CNN reports.","['Hide Caption 17 of 43

"– Jared Kushner will be cooperating with any probe of Russian links to his father-in-law's campaign, a lawyer confirmed Thursday after reports that investigators are focusing on the senior White House adviser surfaced. Attorney Jamie Gorelick said Kushner has already offered to tell Congress all about his meetings with Russian officials and he will do the same ""if contacted in connection with any other inquiry."" Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that federal investigators have been looking into Kushner's Russian contacts for months, though he has not yet been contacted by the FBI. In other coverage: Sources tell NBC News that investigators believe Kushner has information that could be very useful to the Russia investigation, though he's not personally suspected of wrongdoing. Kushner met Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Russian banker Sergey Gorkov last year. Democrats are calling for Kushner's White House security clearance to be pulled, the Hill reports. ""The FBI's Russia investigation reached Trump's backyard, and now it's in his house,"" DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson said in a statement. ""Kushner's security clearance should be suspended until the FBI's findings are complete."" Investigators are also looking into possible financial crimes, according to the Telegraph, though the Justice Department isn't providing details. ""I can't confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of investigations or subjects of investigations,"" spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said. While much is still unclear, there will be plenty of people saying ""I told you so"" if corruption allegations involving Kushner surface, according to Aaron Blake at the Washington Post. Trump's hiring of a family member for a senior White House role was strongly criticized, and ""as any expert on corrupt authoritarian regimes throughout history will tell you, those regimes' wrongdoing will often run through family members with official titles,"" he writes. In a separate development linked to the Russia investigation, House Oversight Committee chief Rep. Jason Chaffetz said he wants to review former FBI Director James Comey's contacts with the White House and Justice Department going all the way back to 2013, the AP reports.

He accuses President Obama of limiting exploration ""in a ways that sap economic performance, curtail growth, and kill jobs."" For more on Romney's energy plan, click here. Innovation matters. Romney writes that ""state-of-the-art new technology"" allowed Bain to create Steel Dynamics, now one of America's largest steel producers. He says his policies, which he doesn't specify, will improve access to higher education, making such innovation possible. Problems must be tackled quickly. Curiously, Romney touts his work with medical diagnostics firm Damon, which was fined for its billing practices and saw one manager go to jail for fraud. But Romney takes credit for catching the problem early, launching an internal investigation when a rival firm had similar problems. ""When you see a problem, run toward it or it will only gets worse,"" he writes, saying he will take the same approach to the federal budget.

"– Barack Obama earned a historic victory when the House passed health care reform last night. How did he do it and what does it mean? Here’s what people are saying: “Obama didn't just work harder to clear this hurdle. He worked deeper,” writes John Dickerson of Slate. For the first time he made a cause personal, framing it in moral terms, and urging lawmakers to risk sacrificing their jobs to do the right thing. He showed a newfound “combative stubbornness,” writes Peter Nicholas of the LA Times. Republicans thought this would be his “Waterloo,” but Obama proved “that a president who picks a goal, adopts a battle plan and sticks with it” is tough to beat. The president basically schmoozed his way to victory, says Jennifer Bendery on Roll Call. Through one-on-one talks and social events, he flipped even tough votes like Dennis Kucinich.

"– If you like energy drinks but hate the drinking part, then Harvard undergrad Ben Yu and venture capitalist Deven Soni have a product for you. The two are trying to launch a product called ""Sprayable Energy,"" that, you guessed it, gives you a jolt of caffeine straight through your skin. While skin is capable of absorbing caffeine, caffeine normally isn't soluble enough to actually be effective. Sprayable Energy adds a ""secret sauce"" (a derivative of the amino acid tyrosine) to correct for that, the Atlantic reports. The spray is comprised of just three ingredients: that derivative, plus caffeine and water. The product is currently up on Indiegogo, and has already more than doubled its initial $15,000 goal with 32 days to go. The plan is to sell a 40-dose bottle for $15.

"– In 1992, a 9,000-word diary was found in the floorboards of a home in England containing a detailed confession to murders tied to Jack the Ripper, the serial killer who terrorized London for 10 weeks in 1888. It ended thusly: ""I give my name that all know of me, so history do tell, what love can do to a gentleman born. Yours Truly, Jack The Ripper."" It appears to belong to wealthy Liverpool cotton Merchant James Maybrick, who died a year later, but many experts dismissed the tell-all tome as a sophisticated forgery. Now, the Telegraph reports, a team led by writer and film director Bruce Robinson has unearthed timecards that show which electricians were working on Maybrick's home, Battlecrease House, on March 9, 1992, the morning the book was said to have been found. The man who came up with the diary, scrap metal dealer Mike Barrett, claimed to have gotten it through a family friend who died soon thereafter, leading many to believe it was a fake. But Barrett was a colorful character who frequented the Saddle Inn public house in Anfield, where one of the electricians working on Battlecrease House was also a regular. Because Barrett fancied himself a writer, it is believed that the electricians who found the book passed it onto Barrett, who then famously contacted a London literary agent that very day in March claiming he had Jack the Ripper's diary, adds the Sun. Mental Floss notes that many suspects have been proposed over the decades, including a former royal obstetrician.

"– As Poland wrestles with the death of President Lech Kaczysnki and 96 others in today's plane crash, attention is turning to the pilots' actions and the Soviet-era plane involved: The pilots ignored orders not to try to land because of heavy fog, reports AP. The plane involved is a 20-year-old Soviet-era Tupelo 154 that had been overhauled in December. Wall Street Journal blogger Marcin Sobczyk notes the planes were nicknamed ""flying coffins"" in Poland. So why are Polish leaders using such old planes? An Economist blogger who flew in one notes that the Tu-154 ""was dated, noisy and not that comfortable, but it had one great strength, I was told. A three-engined jet, it was significantly faster than the modern, two-engined airliners widely used by other governments for long-distance VIP transport. ...

"– Bridesmaids who party together, fight together. That was apparently the unspoken code at a wedding last Sunday in Palm Coast, Fla., where the New York Post reports an uninvited interloper caused a scene with a man she claimed was her boyfriend. Per WKMG, deputies say 20-year-old Shelby McDowell snuck into the Hammock Beach Resort to keep tabs on Darby Johns, who was attending a wedding there as an invited guest and who McDowell says is her romantic partner. Once there, McDowell said she saw Johns making out with a woman on the dance floor. That woman told cops McDowell rushed over to where she and Johns were, tossed a drink on the pair, then punched her face; Johns says they hadn't even made it to the dance floor yet when McDowell came onto the scene, and he denies kissing the other woman. After allegedly assaulting Johns' companion, witnesses say McDowell then ran to a resort bathroom—and that's when the wedding party apparently decided to get involved. McDowell says a bunch of bridesmaids yanked her out of a bathroom stall by her feet and started hitting her, but the resort manager told police that when he arrived on the scene to break up the brawl, McDowell was on top of the woman who'd been with Johns and was punching her. To make matters more complicated, at least for McDowell: Johns says she's not his girlfriend. McDowell was booked at the Flagler County Jail and faces misdemeanor battery charges, per WPEC.

"– Two key facts about billionaire Robert Mercer: He is, in the words of a recent New Yorker profile, the ""reclusive hedge-fund tycoon behind the Trump presidency."" Second, the IRS is going after his Renaissance Technologies fund for nearly $7 billion in back taxes. All of which sets up a dicey situation for President Trump, as a story at McClatchy News Service explains. Mercer wants IRS chief John Koskinen booted from office, and he's pushing Trump to fire him before his five-year term expires in November. The president has not tipped his hand on whether he'll do that, but it makes for ""bad optics,"" per the chief ethics adviser in the George W. Bush White House. ""The guy’s got a big case in front of the IRS,"" says Richard Painter. ""He’s trying to put someone in there who’s going to drop the case. Is the president of the United States going to succumb to that?"" Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is a major political player on the right as well, ramped up political contributions to conservative groups after the IRS began investigating his fund's use of a complicated banking method known as ""basket options"" in 2010 to cut its tax bill, reports McClatchy. The method involves converting short-term gains on trades into long-term gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. The IRS does not comment on ongoing cases, but a Senate panel accused the fund of short-changing the agency of at least $6.8 billion. The company has maintained that it did nothing illegal. One thing that could work in the Mercers' favor: They have long ties to top Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Still, a Columbia professor says that even if the Mercers succeed in getting Koskinen fired, it's doubtful that would upend a years-long IRS case.","['Designed, in part, as a place where the extended

"– A major figure in the emergence of psychedelic rock in the 1960s has died. Marty Balin, who co-founded Jefferson Airplane and played on and off with its later iteration, Jefferson Starship, died en route to the hospital in Tampa, Florida, at age 76, reports the New York Times. The cause of death wasn't immediately known. The Times calls Balin a ""prime mover in the flowering of psychedelic rock in mid-1960s San Francisco,"" not only through the band he co-founded in 1965 but through a nightclub he owned called the Matrix. Rolling Stone has a detailed obituary on Balin's interesting career, noting that he was a struggling folk guitarist when he met another guitarist named Paul Kantner and decided to form a band. Other original Airplane members were guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady, drummer Skip Spence, and singer Signe Toly Anderson, but the band didn't truly take off until Anderson left and was replaced by Grace Slick in 1967, notes Rolling Stone. Balin wrote or co-wrote many of the songs, and his ""high and soulful"" voice became a signature sound for the group, per Variety. (Here is ""Comin' Back to Me."") But he was also a savvy businessman, as this old quote from the late Kanter shows: “He was the leader of the band on that level. He was the one who pushed us to do all the business stuff, orchestrating, thinking ahead, looking for managers and club opportunities. He was very good at it.”","['Balin was a galvanizing member of both the band and the San Francisco scene, and in 1965 helped launch a club in the city called the Matrix that hosted many groups of the era, ranging from the Airplane, the Doors and Janis Joplin to the Velvet Underground', 'It was 20 years later that the band received the Recording Academy’s lifetime achievement award, with Patti

"– Wendy Davis officially announced her candidacy for governor of Texas yesterday, and Judith Warner thinks she's exactly what Democrats need—and not just because of her filibuster-generated fame. ""Blonde, strikingly pretty, outspoken, and female, Davis is, to put it bluntly, invaluable as bait,"" Warner writes at Time.

""As a misogyny magnet,"" Warner thinks Davis will be ""the gift that keeps on giving.""

"– Seven people died across four states as a winter storm continued to tear through the Midwest, dumping more than a foot of snow on sections of Iowa and Wisconsin. A 25-car pileup in Iowa killed two people, and nearly 100 accidents were reported in the state by late last night. Kansas, Wisconsin, and Nebraska also suffered deaths, the AP reports.

"– Make room, GOPers: Scott Walker is running for president. ""I'm in. I'm running for president because Americans deserve a leader who will fight and win for them,"" he tweeted (this time for real) today. But for the Wisconsin governor—who dropped a ""barn-burner of a speech"" on February's CPAC and boasted he can take on ISIS—there are, as the Hill puts it, both ""high expectations and doubts."" What could boost his run: his record in Wisconsin on cutting taxes and unemployment, his strong stance against organized labor, and the potential to win Iowa's caucuses based on ""high polling numbers and plenty of grassroots enthusiasm,"" per the Hill. He's not a shoe-in, though. ""He's clearly the frontrunner and there’s a lot of interest in him here,” a former Iowa Republican Party official tells the paper. ""But he still has a lot of work to do."" Part of that work will involve breaking away from what the Hill calls his image ""as a vanilla candidate from the Midwest who lacks the 'wow' factor"" to compete with more engaging candidates. Other issues: The Hill notes that critics will go after his foreign policy weaknesses, as well as lob accusations that he's ""flip-flopped"" on immigration. He'll also have to defend fiscal problems back in Wisconsin, adds Washington Post, including an embarrassingly late budget and financing for a new stadium for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks—a deal that's been called a ""hot mess."" Finally, Walker may need to break from what some see as a one-platform campaign focused on unions. ""You can't run solely on your biography, and so far, he’s been almost solely focused on that,"" the ex-IRP official tells the Hill.

"– The water in Flint, Michigan, still hasn't been tested for the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease despite being the likely source of an outbreak that killed nine people and sickened another 78 between May 2014 and November 2015, the Detroit News reports. The New York Times alleges the deadly outbreak was handled the same way the larger Flint water crisis was: through ""a failure to act swiftly to address a dangerous problem or warn the public."" In fact, state officials didn't even let the public know about the outbreak of Legionnaires' until last month. The outbreak started six months after Flint switched to the Flint River as its water source. Genesee County raised concerns about the water being a likely source of Legionnaires' in 2014, and five government agencies—including the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the EPA—were aware of it.

"– An Oregon bakery that refused to make a cake for a lesbian couple and then refused to pay the $135,000 damages award that ensued has decided to finally pay up. A spokesman for the state Bureau of Labor and Industries tells KOIN that Aaron Klein, co-owner of Sweet Cakes by Melissa, paid $136,927.07 on Monday to settle the damages and interest. The spokesman says that with the help of a private collections agency, the bureau had already recovered around $7,000 from a garnished bank account belonging to Aaron and Melissa Klein, who closed their bakery in 2013 and now run the business from home. The couple was ordered to pay damages after authorities decided they had violated the civil rights of the two women who ordered a wedding cake. The Kleins' lawyer tells the Oregonian that they still plan to appeal the ruling, but they decided it didn't make sense to rack up interest charges while the case was pending.

"– Mount St. Helens already stands out as one of the most active volcanoes in the Cascade Arc and the deadliest in the US, since its 1980 eruption claimed nearly 60 lives. It's also an outlier in a literal sense, sitting 30 miles west of the volcanoes that neatly line the Cascade Arc from north to south. Now scientists are reporting in the journal Nature Communications that they've discovered another oddity: The volcano appears to be perched atop what Gizmodo calls ""a cool wedge of serpentine rock""—dramatically unlike the fiery cauldrons of hot magma beneath other volcanoes. ""We don’t have a good explanation for why that’s the case,"" Steve Hansen, a geoscientist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, tells Gizmodo. His team drilled a couple dozen holes, filled them with explosives, and triggered minor earthquakes to watch seismic wave activity beneath Mount St. Helens, ""a bit like a CAT scan,"" Hansen says. But their findings leave them with more questions, namely: What's the volcano's heat source, if it's not right below the volcano itself? Hansen surmises that it's coming from further east, but until his team does more research, it's what Science News is calling ""a cold case.""

"– US and Japanese vessels and aircraft are searching for seven American sailors who are missing after their Navy destroyer collided before dawn with a container ship four times its size off the coast of Japan. The USS Fitzgerald was back at its home port in Yokosuka Naval Base south of Tokyo by sunset Saturday, following the crash at 2:20am local time. The USS Fitzgerald's captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was airlifted early Saturday to the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka and was in stable condition with a head injury; two other crew members suffered cuts and bruises and were evacuated, reports the AP. The US 7th Fleet said in a statement that the crash damaged two berthing spaces, a machinery room, and the radio room, and CNN says its statement suggests the missing could be in the ship's crushed mid-right side. ""It remains uncertain how long it will take to gain access to the spaces once the ship is pier side ... to methodically continue the search for the missing,"" the statement said. Most of the more than 200 sailors aboard would have been asleep in their berths at the time of the pre-dawn crash. The Navy said that the collision occurred 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, home to the 7th Fleet. The ACX Crystal weighs 29,060 tons, making it much larger than the 8,315-ton Navy destroyer. The container ship's left bow was dented and scraped, but it did not appear to have sustained any major structural damage. The Philippine-flagged container ship was berthed at Tokyo's Oi wharf, where officials began questioning crew members about the cause of the crash and are treating the incident as a case of possible professional negligence.","['""Right now we are focused on two things: the safety of the ship and the well-being of the sailors,"" said Adm', 'The U', 'Five Japanese Maritime Self Defense force ships were leading the search for the missing US sailors at the site of the collision, joined by another US warship, the guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey, the 7th Fleet said', 'Tokyo (CNN) Seven US sailors are missing and the commanding officer of a US destroyer is among the injured after the warship and a merchant ship collided off the coast of Japan, the US Navy said', ""Benson, the Fitzgerald's commander, was new to the position, having taken command of the vessel May 13 after serving as the ship's executive officer, or second in command, since November 2015, the Navy said last month"", 'The larger size of the container ship could have left the smaller US destroyer vulnerable in the collision, Schuster said', 'to methodically continue the search for the missing,"" the statement said', 'Conditions were clear at the time of the collision, though Yutaka Saito of the coast guard said the area is particularly busy with sea traffic', 'The Japanese coast guard said it received an emergency call from the container ship, the ACX Crystal, reporting the collision at around 2:20 a', 'The force of the impact could have thrown overboard sailors who were standing on the opposite side of the destroyer from where it was struck, he said', 'The merchant vessel involved is the ACX Crystal, a container ship flagged in the Philippines, officials said', 'Water was being pumped out of flooded areas and it was unclear how long it would take to get into the crushed mid-right side of the ship once it was at the pier in Yokosuka, the statement said', ""NYK and the ship's owner are cooperating a Japan Coast Guard investigation into the collision, the shipping firm said"", 'After helping stabilize the USS Fitzgerald, the destroyer USS Dewey joined other American and Japanese vessels and aircraft in the search for the missing sailors', 'The statement hinted that the missing sailors could be trapped in the damaged area of the destroyer', 'The area where the wreck happened is known for heavy maritime traffic, the Japanese coast guard said', 'local time Saturday in the Pacific Ocean, about 56 nautical miles southwest from the port of Yokosuka and 12 miles off the Izu Peninsula, the Japanese coast guard said', 'The collision was the second in the region for US Navy warship in just more than a month', 'The Navy said that the collision occurred 56 nautical miles (103 kilometers) southwest of Yokosuka, home to the 7th Fleet', 'The ship-tracking website marinetraffic', ""Damage to the Philippine container ship ACX Crystal is seen after it collided with the USS Fitzgerald in the waters off Izu Peninsula, this photo released by Japan's coast guard shows"", 'It completed $21 million in upgrades and repairs in February and is forward-deployed to Yokosuka, supporting security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, the service said', 'The ACX Crystal weighs 29,060 tons and is 222 meters (730 feet) long, the coast guard said, much larger than the 8,315-ton Navy destroyer', 'Most of the more than 200 sailors aboard would have been asleep in their berths at the time of the pre-dawn crash', 'About 400 to 500 ships pass through the zone each day, the service said', ""The Philippine-flagged container ship was berthed at Tokyo's Oi wharf, where officials began questioning crew members about the cause of the nighttime crash"", 'The Fitzgerald had left the US naval base in Yokosuka, where it is based, earlier Friday for routine operations in the area, a US Naval Forces Japan spokesman said', 'The USS Fitzgerald heads to Yokosuka, home base of the 7th Fleet, beside a US tugboat, off Shimoda, Japan on Saturday', 'The Japan', 'The names of the missing sailors were being withheld pending notification of their families', '""Just heard the sweetest voice and saw a wonderful face', 'The Fitzgerald is the second command for Benson, a 1999 Naval ROTC graduate of Marquette University', '""The collision affected Fitzgerald\'s forward starboard side above and below the water line, causing significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room,"" according to a statement from US 7th Fleet', 'local time, officials said after the wreck, adding that the container ship was operating under charter to a Japanese shipping company']"
"– In November 2011, a worker from the nonprofit Peace Winds Japan scouting for search and rescue dogs at a Hiroshima animal welfare center came across 4-month-old Yumenosuke. The mixed-breed pup was set to be put down that day, but a backlog meant his number was never called. PWJ took him in and trained him, and the group's efforts paid off recently: He made his first recovery amid the rubble of Japanese landslides that killed dozens in mid-August, reports the Asahi Shimbun, as spotted by Gawker. Yumenosuke wasn't a natural when he first started his rescue-and-recovery schooling: He wasn't assertive or overly curious, both necessary traits for the job, notes the paper. Over time, however, he gained confidence and learned to follow directions as he accrued experience performing mountain searches. When he made his first official find on Aug. 20 in the Yagi section of Hiroshima, Yumenosuke didn't raise a ruckus by barking: He simply fixed his gaze on a pile of lumber and didn't take it off until his handler checked out the pile. Sadly, a man's body was found under the wood, but Yumenosuke had done his job. ""A dog abandoned by people is now rescuing them,” his handler tells the paper. “It is proof that Yumenosuke deserves to live.” (In the US, a pit bull is being hailed as a hero.)","['The NPO was visiting the center to “recruit” a search and rescue dog', 'On the other hand, Hulk, who performed well in competitions, was ready at any time to act as a search and rescue dog', 'A PWJ staff member found Yumenosuke at the Hiroshima prefectural animal welfare center in Mihara in November 2011, when the dog was only 4 months old', 'Yumenosuke, a male mixed-blooded dog trained as a search and rescue dog, first helped out at the disaster-affected Yagi district of the city’s Asa-Minami Ward on Aug', '4-year-old Yumenosuke stopped near a house, the first floor of which was buried in mud', 'Yumenosuke gradually leaned to follow commands, and spent years training to search for survivors in the mountains', 'With their duty being to rescue survivors, the dogs were pulled out of the site for the day', 'Unlike many other rescue dogs, which are trained to bark when they find a survivor, Yumenosuke kept gazing at the fallen lumber', ', Yumenosuke’s “colleague” Hulk, a 3-year-old golden retriever, started barking at the remains of another home', 'Gradually he learned to follow instructions and accumulated experience of searching for survivors in the mountains', 'Asia & Japan Watch reports that Yumenosuke, a male mixed-blooded dog, was dispatched to the rescue effort from non-profit organization Peace Winds Japan', 'The puppy was adopted by the NPO', 'But little Yumenosuke hardly seemed suited to be a rescue dog because of his cautious nature', ""The dog's handler, Hiroyuki Sano, soon found a man's body in the debris""]"
"– A sad end to a strange story: Bryan Johnson, a former police officer accused of calling in a bomb threat and faking a shootout earlier this year, was found dead in his Millis, Mass., home Thanksgiving morning—and authorities believe he died by his own hand, USA Today reports. The 24-year-old faced a potential sentence of more than 40 years in prison over the bizarre events of Sept. 2, when he allegedly fired his personal firearm into his own cruiser and told dispatchers a man in a pickup truck had shot at him and fled, reports the Boston Herald. Prosecutors say Johnson, whose vehicle was found burning and crashed into a tree, called in a bomb threat to a local school the same day. The twin hoaxes caused the Boston-area town to be put on lockdown for hours during a huge manhunt, CBS reports. Johnson, a police dispatcher who worked part-time as an officer, was fired after authorities decided there had been a hoax. He was indicted on six charges last week and, according to court records seen by USA Today, was on home confinement at the time of his death.

"– New Moon is basking in the glow of its success, but the second Twilight film, and even the headlines about its box office records, are sexist, some say. Vampire love interest Edward is “overbearing,” and heroine Bella “quite literally lies down and takes it,” write Carmen D. Siering and Katherine Spillar in Ms. “This is a film full of gender stereotypes—testosterone-driven male aggression, females who pine away over lost loves, boys who fix motorcycles, and the girls who watch them.” And the media attention paid to the film isn’t much better, writes Rachel Simmons on her website. Headlines like “OMG New Moon Has $140 Million Opening!” use teen-girl-speak to talk about the film’s success, but Simmons doesn’t find it cute. It “feels like an attempt to both mock girl culture and detract from the very butch success of this women and girl-driven phenomenon,” signaling that Hollywood may be intimidated by a “guy-proof” film franchise.","['community and have the magazine delivered to your door', 'What follows is the requisite time-passing montage of the two of them fixing the bikes and, Jacob hopes, Bella’s broken heart', '” The truth is, Bella is obviously attracted to Jacob, and spends much of the film physically close to him', 'Edward reverts to his overbearing ways, dictating the direction of the relationship—in this case, ending it—and Bella quite literally lies down and takes it', 'Like the previous film, New Moon wraps its romantic sensuality in a tidy abstinence message, but this time Bella denies her physical attraction and growing fondness for Jacob in order to remain true to Edward, never mind that he dumped her', 'And as we saw in a recent New York Times profile of Kristen Stewart, the Twilight Saga allows her to pursue a dark, authentic role for a young woman – albeit a disturbing one — opportnities that are clearly in short supply for young women even a few years older, like Megan Fox (profiled by the New York times on the same day in part about her struggle to be taken seriously)', 'Perpetuating the idea that this is true love—torturous, painful, and unrequited—is detrimental to all of us, women and men', 'But what Meyer fails to acknowledge is that all the choices Bella makes are the one’s Meyer would make—choices based perhaps on her background as a member of the highly patriarchal Mormon church', 'In writing about the box office juggernaut — a film that is smashing records left and right, beating Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings in online advance sales, among other “firsts” — headline writers are using the language of teen girls', 'I wonder if it makes people uncomfortable that, as the blogger Melissa Silverstein wrote, “A franchise fueled by girls and women has the potential of beating the machines for the box office record', 'If there really isn’t anything new under the moon-blocked sun, we’ll expect even more of the same, and another missed opportunity to create a Bella who stands more on her own', 'In fact, just moments after Edward leaves her, Bella stumbles in the woods and refuses to get up, lying in the muck until a strong, bare-chested man carries her out', 'Where director Catherine Hardwicke, who helmed the first Twilight film, subtly tweaked the characters of Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson), creating a somewhat more equal relationship between them, New Moon director Chris Weitz seems content to let things stand as Meyer wrote them']"
